I've cultivated a nice little bird-friendly backyard with feeders, a bird bath, and native plants. I get lots of lovely visitors – finches, cardinals, chickadees, etc.\\n\\nMy next-door neighbors recently got a cat, 'Shadow'. They let it roam freely outdoors. And Shadow has decided my yard is his personal hunting ground. He constantly sneaks into my yard, hides under bushes, and stalks the birds at my feeders and bath.\\n\\nI've seen him actually catch and kill a bird twice now. It's heartbreaking. It also scares away all the other birds. My peaceful sanctuary has become a feline hunting zone.\\n\\nI've spoken to the neighbors ('Jim' and 'Linda') about it. \\nFirst time: 'Hey, could you please try to keep Shadow out of my yard? He's scaring the birds.' Response: 'Oh, cats will be cats! He probably won't catch them.'\\nSecond time (after seeing him kill one): 'Jim, your cat just killed a bird in my yard. This is really upsetting. You need to keep him contained.' Response: 'It's nature, survival of the fittest. We can't keep him inside all day, it's cruel.'\\n\\nThey are completely dismissive. They refuse to put a bell on him, keep him indoors, or build a catio. They seem to think his 'right to roam' trumps my right to enjoy my property and protect the wildlife I attract there.\\n\\nThere are leash laws for dogs in my city, but they're vague about cats. I'm considering using cat deterrents (motion-activated sprinklers?) but worry about antagonizing the neighbors further. Is there anything else I can do legally or practically?\\n\\nTL;DR: Neighbors let their cat roam freely. It constantly comes into my yard, stalks and kills the birds at my feeders. Neighbors refuse to contain the cat or do anything about it. Need solutions.\"\"\"\n",
