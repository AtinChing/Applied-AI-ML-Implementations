# Applied AI/ML Implementations

This repository showcases a growing collection of applied machine learning and AI projects built from scratch or using powerful libraries.

It includes:
- End-to-end classification systems
- Weak supervision + data generation pipelines
- Agentic AI experimentation
- Neural network implementations from scratch
- Regression experiments on real-world datasets

## ‚úÖ Key Projects

- **Reddit Niche Classifier**  
  ‚Üí Scrapes Reddit posts, applies weak supervision via LLMs, classifies post niche  
  ‚Üí Hugging Face dataset + model deployed

- **Post Popularity Regressor (coming soon)**  
  ‚Üí Predicts Reddit post popularity based on early social metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtinChing/Applied_AI_ML_Implementations.git
cd Applied_AI_ML_Implementations
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Plan for next things to do:
- Linear Regression -  Some numerical or % thing.
- K Means Clustering - brainstorm
- Classification - Shorts/Reddit Niche classification
- Hidden Markov Models - brainstorm
