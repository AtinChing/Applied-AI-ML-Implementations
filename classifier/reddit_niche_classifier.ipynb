    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**\n\nAskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.\n\nThis is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.\n\n\\-The AskReddit mods",

         "We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \\_\\_\\_\\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a \"shower thought\" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.\n* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe Ass Credit Mods",

One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers.

She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n\nHowever, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n\nI tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.\n\nNow, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.\n\nI'm not sure what I should do, or what I *can* do. I don't know what to apologize *for* and I feel like my friends are siding with her.\n\nTL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.",

         "\n36F 37M we've been together for 3.5 years \n\nTL;DR My \"perfect\" boyfriend risked my life and didn't think it was a big deal.\n\n\nI’m upset because my boyfriend didn’t tell me I had a seizure until 11:45 PM the next day. I’m having a bad reaction to my seizure meds and working closely with my neurologist, so I needed to know right away—especially because I drove that day, which I never would’ve done if I knew.\n\nHe told me not to talk to him that day because he was “busy at work,” but later admitted it was really because I was being clingy. He didn’t check on me once, and still told me what meals he wanted, knowing I’d have to drive to the store to get ingredients.\n\nI feel ignored, unimportant, and honestly unsafe—not just because of what happened, but because of how he handled it.\n\nHe's never done anything remotely like this, been together 3.5 years and it's been amazing \n \nAfter I told him not to talk to me (we live together) and he respected that.\n\nTold him yesterday I'm ready to talk but I'm unsure what to say",

         "My partner (25F) and I (33M) have been together for 5 years and recently became parents to a 6-month-old. Since the birth, I’ve experienced a huge drop in libido. I don’t feel the same desire for intimacy anymore, and it’s become a real issue in our relationship.\n\nShe doesn’t pressure me for sex, but she’s internalizing the change. She asks if I think she’s fat or unattractive and says she feels rejected. I’ve told her honestly that I still find her beautiful and that this change is coming from me, not from anything she’s done. But she doesn’t believe me.\n\nIt’s now impacting our emotional closeness. She’s more withdrawn, less affectionate, and I can feel a growing distance. I want to reconnect with her, but I don’t know how to repair this gap while I’m still feeling disconnected from myself too.\n\n**Length of Relationship:**  \nTogether 4 years, baby is 6 months old\n\n**What I’m looking for advice on:**  \nWhat are healthy ways to rebuild emotional and physical intimacy when one partner is experiencing low libido? How can I make her feel seen and loved while I work through this? I’m also open to advice from anyone who's gone through something similar postpartum (as a partner or parent).\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nSince our baby was born, I \\[33M\\] have almost no sex drive. My partner \\[25F\\] thinks I find her unattractive, and it’s affecting our connection. I want to make things better but don’t know where to start.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nWife and I read the comments. Truly appreciate you all. We have decided to talk about some of the advice mentioned in the thread. Also, I will call the doctor first thing tomorrow to check my testosterone levels. ",

         "I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.",
         "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n\nFor context:\n\n* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n\nBefore moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n\nAt the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nAbout the dog:\n\n* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n\nFast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n\nAfter 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n\n**How should I approach this conversation with him?**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMoved in with my boyfriend (M/27) last year. Despite agreeing to hold off on getting a dog, he pressured me into it a month later. He travels a lot, and I end up being the sole caretaker for both his anxious herding dog and my own lower maintenance dog. After 10 days of solo dog duty, I’ve hit a breaking point. I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.",

         "Hi yall,\n\nSo i just needed some advice. me and my friend who hasn’t had sex in 2 years have been ig seeing eachother the past 2 weeks. we kissed twice prior to this weekend. so as u can tell things were getting serious. We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n\nTl:dr i was making out with a friend and was about to have sex, as soon as i was ready to put it in i became soft, need advice",

         "I ended my engagement and have regrets. (27F) (30M)",
         "Hi everyone,\nI (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n\nBut things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n\nHis family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him. And still, when I asked for support or tried to express how I felt, I was told I was making things about me or being too sensitive.\n\nAs time went on, I started to feel like the relationship was incredibly one-sided. His goals, his plans, and his needs always came first. Mine were often ignored or treated like they weren’t as important. I still loved him, but I didn’t feel like I mattered. The emotional weight of the relationship became too much.\n\nThe last straw was when he brought up a prenup. It wasn’t the fact that he wanted one, but the way and timing of how it came up. It made me feel even more like I wasn’t truly seen or trusted. It confirmed what I had already been feeling for a long time. I didn’t feel like an equal, and I didn’t feel emotionally safe.\n\nI eventually made the decision to walk away. And even though part of me feels clear about why I left, another part of me keeps wondering if I made the right call. Maybe it was just a hard season. Maybe I was overwhelmed. Or maybe choosing myself was exactly what I needed to do.\n\nI still care about him. I still think about the good moments. But I also know how hard it felt to be in it.\n\nAny honest thoughts or perspective would mean a lot. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR:\nEnded a 4 year relationship after getting engaged. We argued constantly, I felt unheard and unappreciated, and the way he brought up a prenup was the final straw. Still love him, but I didn’t feel emotionally safe. Now I’m wondering if I gave up too soon.",

         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?",
         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself 24/7. \n\n\n• Every time I do something it’s always “why are you doing it like that?” or “why don’t you just do this” or even more aggravating, he says “that’s unnecessary”. Every single day. I will say I want to do something a certain way and he questions me about it and I explain to him why I want to do something the way I want and it’s deemed “unnecessary” (his words) even if it has absolutely nothing to do with him. He’s told me before that he does it to help me but I have my own reasons for doing things my way. Even when he explains to me why he thinks it’s unnecessary to do something the way I want, I listen to him and consider his suggestion and go with my way and he calls me crazy for not listening to his advice that I never asked for. \nMy husband is very intelligent, I would say he is much smarter than me and I think some of his ways are efficient but it’s the fact that I cannot have my own ideas without criticism. \n\nEVERY TIME I do chores, he will ask me if I’m okay and I’ll say “yeah I just have a lot to do”(i do all the house chores and take care of our four month old baby and he goes to work, does the outdoor stuff and takes out the trash) and EVERY TIME he’ll say “well dont do that right now it’s unnecessary. Go lay down and take a nap, I’ll do it later”. I tried that before, you know, let him “do it later” like he said; just to see when exactly “later” meant to him and the laundry piled up so bad it was overflowing and covering the entire floor, the dishes stunk in the sink, the house was a mess. I told him this is what happens when you say “I’ll do it later” and this is why I don’t feel comfortable waiting to do chores. He said “I was getting to it”. Yeah make me feel like crap for doing chores and tell me you’ll take care of it then proceed to not do what you said you’d do. \n\n• On top of that, he doesn’t like listening to the stuff I enjoy talking about. For example, I will read a book a really enjoy and I’m so excited to talk about it with him, if he isn’t interested, he just stares blankly at me and says nothing. He listens which I appreciate but if it’s something he just doesn’t care about, he says “and?” or he just nods his head and turns away. \n\nNow I understand if you’re not interested in something it’s hard to act like you are but he tells me stuff 50 times a day I don’t care about at all like politics, or what’s in the news, or something in his game, or just random stupid facts. The difference between him and me when it comes to that is I try to be interested or I will at least I pretend to be. He doesn’t even try. It makes me feel so small when he does this to me. \n\n————————————————————————\n\n- We’ve had a conversation about this MANY times and I’ve told him that it makes me feel terrible about myself and he always says “well that’s just who I am, I can’t change that”. I don’t know what to say to that. I just stop talking after that. I have addressed many issues I’ve had with him before and he’s changed his ways but this he can’t change. \n\n- I just decided not to talk to him a lot anymore. Not about something I’m interested in or excited about, not when I’m doing stuff, I just try to avoid his words. I know he loves me and he does prove it to me every day by giving me love and affection and doing things for me and helping me around the house (when he feels like it) but these things just make me feel super bad about myself. Am I overreacting? \n\nTL;DR My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: As I’m reading some of the comments, I see that this behavior is not normal and that I am not overreacting. I always heard that marriage is hard but I genuinely do believe that he cares about me and he loves me because he shows me and he HAS changed his ways before when I brought up other issues I’ve had with him. I’m going to try different approaches and see how that works now that I am more aware of how he is treating me is wrong. Thank you everyone for your advice and opening my eyes. ",

      "Body text: Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \\[33F\\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n",

      "However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n",

      "Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",

      "For context:\n",

      "* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n",
      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",

      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",

I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much.

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "I (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him. And still, when I asked for support or tried to express how I felt, I was told I was making things about me or being too sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on, I started to feel like the relationship was incredibly one-sided. His goals, his plans, and his needs always came first. Mine were often ignored or treated like they weren’t as important. I still loved him, but I didn’t feel like I mattered. The emotional weight of the relationship became too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last straw was when he brought up a prenup. It wasn’t the fact that he wanted one, but the way and timing of how it came up. It made me feel even more like I wasn’t truly seen or trusted. It confirmed what I had already been feeling for a long time. I didn’t feel like an equal, and I didn’t feel emotionally safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I eventually made the decision to walk away. And even though part of me feels clear about why I left, another part of me keeps wondering if I made the right call. Maybe it was just a hard season. Maybe I was overwhelmed. Or maybe choosing myself was exactly what I needed to do.\n",

Go lay down and take a nap, I’ll do it later”. I tried that before, you know, let him “do it later” like he said; just to see when exactly “later” meant to him and the laundry piled up so bad it was overflowing and covering the entire floor, the dishes stunk in the sink, the house was a mess. I told him this is what happens when you say “I’ll do it later” and this is why I don’t feel comfortable waiting to do chores. He said “I was getting to it”.

      "\n",
      "Even after the move, I stayed in touch with them regularly. I visited when I could, we chatted online, and I felt like I was still part of the group. But now that we’re in our final school year and preparing for exams, it feels like everything’s changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve grown closer to each other and more distant from me. We don’t really talk unless I’m the one reaching out, and even then, the conversations feel surface-level. I’m starting to realize that I’m not really part of their lives anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn’t say I have no one — maybe two people from the group still check in occasionally — but I can’t even be sure where I stand with them anymore. It just feels like they’ve moved on, and I’m stuck in the past trying to hold on to something that’s fading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know friendships change over time, especially during high school, but this still hurts. I don’t blame anyone — life happens — but I guess I just feel left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is this just part of growing up? And how do you even start to build new friendships when you feel like everyone already has their circles?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; I moved schools a few years ago but kept in touch with my old friend group. Now that we’re in our final school year, they’ve all drifted away and I feel like I’ve been left behind. Only maybe two still talk to me, and even that’s uncertain. Not sure how to deal with the loneliness or how to form new friendships this late in high school.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been dating an amazing girl for 7 months now. Her personality is the best I could ask for understanding, considerate, kind, unmaterialistic. She does have mental problems like insecurities, scared to call people but I couldn’t care less about them. And I did love her in the beginning. However recently I started doubting my own feelings. One moment I look at her and see the cutest being ever and then the other I just feel empty. I do have my own issues associated with childhood like abandonment threats when I was a kid and other abusive things revolving round my childhood. I was also raised to be as efficient as I could be and well we know relationships are not efficient at all.And so recently I was wondering what to do because I just can’t understand my own feelings. I either feel like I love her or simply nothing towards her. But when I imagine her cry I wanna cry and throw up. When I imagine breaking up with her I just can’t help but hesitate that im breaking smth that I shouldn’t. I just feel so conflicted and broken right now. We r a bit codependent since I dknt really need people around me and she is an introvert who finds it hard to find new people. So maybe the issue it that? I jus really don’t understand what im supposed to do\n",

      "\n",
      "Im a F (27) my bf of 5 almost 6 years is 34. He’s an amazing man and step dad he literally takes care of everything but he is not affectionate in general. He tells me he loves me as well as my son who he has been in his life since my son was 2 and basically helped me raise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never snuggles and never gives me random kisses etc unless he’s drunk. We smoke flower together and his personality doesn’t change but when he drinks he opens up like a Book. He tells me all about his life and gives me so much affection it feels like I’m in a movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand when he’s working (we both work from home) he gets so easily bothered if I try to take his attention away from Work even for a second. Then if I get mad it usually carries on til after work.\n",

      "The reason I’m posting is because this happened again right now and all I can think of is I feel like getting him something to drink so that he can be nice to me again. But I feel like that’s not right. I know I should probably compromise and accept that he isn’t generally an affectionate person but it drives me crazy knowing he has the capability to do the things that would make me so happy and he just doesn’t unless he’s had a couple drinks.\n",

      "Title: Our friend (24M) of 9 years suddenly blocked me (25F) and me (25F) our entire friend group. I’m hurt and confused. How do I process this?\n",
      "Body text: This is a platonic relationship so I am unsure if this will be accepted but here goes nothing :/ So a close friend of ours (24M) recently blocked and unfollowed all of us. His main friend group consists of girls, and he removed us from WhatsApp, Instagram, and even blocked our phone numbers. It was completely out of the blue and has left us feeling confused, worried, and honestly, really hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days ago, I messaged him just to check in because I hadn’t heard from him and noticed that his WhatsApp was stuck on one tick. There was no response. I tried reaching out on other platforms too, but still nothing. Eventually, I tried calling his SIM, but it was turned off. That’s when I got really concerned. I reached out to the rest of our friend group to see if they had heard from him. None of them had, and his phone was also unreachable for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one of our friends noticed he had unfollowed all of us on Instagram. That’s when I really started to worry. I suspected he might have blocked me on WhatsApp too, so I used my dad’s phone to call and text him. It went through immediately. I realized he had blocked me. I tested his SIM as well from my dad’s number. It rang. So not only did he block us from social media and WhatsApp, he also blocked our numbers. Again, no explanation, no message, nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, we weren’t in a fight or anything to suggest he wanted nothing to do with us. I was checking in because I was genuinely concerned, and it was unlike him not to talk for more than 5 days. He recently went through a tough breakup and has been in a rough emotional state. I went over to his place multiple times to check on him when he said he needed a friend. I understand grief and needing space, but his choice to block the people trying to support him felt so hurtful. I even reached out to an old mutual friend from school who still talks to him. I explained the situation, told him our friend had been going through a breakup, and mentioned that the girl he was seeing had apparently gotten engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today. The mutual friend messaged me again and asked if I was sure she got engaged. I said yes, and that the friend who blocked us told me she was, which was why he was so heartbroken. Then the mutual friend told me he just posted a picture of her on his story.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it all started to make sense. It seems he may have done what he did because this same girl has never liked us and has previously made efforts to cut us out of his life. Now it seems like he may have blocked and unfollowed us at her request. The fact that he is still in contact with her and even posting her on his story makes it look like they may have gotten back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "What hurts most is that I thought we had a strong friendship. We’ve traveled together. Spent years being there for each other. I know some of the others in our group only know him online, but I’ve shared real memories with this guy. For him to shut us out like this, without even a goodbye or a reason, is devastating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t even know if I want to be friends again if he eventually comes back and acts like nothing happened. Because he’s done that before. It’s awkward. And it feels so one-sided. I just don't know how to process this and I have been crying so much today.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "Friend (24M) recently went through a breakup and suddenly blocked our entire friend group from social media, WhatsApp, and phone calls. I was really worried and tried reaching out in every way possible. Later found out from a mutual friend that he posted his ex on his story, suggesting he may have blocked us because she asked him to. It’s hurtful, especially after everything we’ve shared. I don’t know how to process it.\n",

      "5. She made a big deal about the group splitting up to get ready for a grad party, claiming that she was left behind and we all were going to hang out without her. We only split up for an hour and she did not come along since she was staying in a different place. The whole event was very stressful and dramatic and honestly made me feel uncomfortable throughout the rest of the night.\n",

      "Title: I [36M] opened up to my romantic interest [29F] about my past trauma. I feel like I shouldn't have done it.\n",
      "Body text: Long-story-short, I met a person who makes me feel a way that I haven't felt in a very long time. Let's call her Jane. By sheer coincidence, Jane is colleagues with somebody I know. I haven't had a good relationship with that colleague in the past for unrelated reasons. However, that colleague is also a known manipulator and resorted to twisting some facts about my father's very recent funeral.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, my father didn't contact me in over 20 years. I reached out multiple times, but he simply wasn't interested in maintaining a relationship. As a result, I didn't attend his funeral, when he died recently. I was devastated because now I will never learn why he didn't want me, but I also didn't want to go to the funeral, as we weren't close, and he didn't care about me. And my sister, who ignored me up to that point, suddenly wanted me to chip in for the funeral and help her organize things, which I refused. He owed me and my mom a ton of money for not paying alimony for years, so it seemed like an extra spit in my face to be requested that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the colleague knew about this and informed Jane about my absence from the funeral and my refusal to share the costs, but didn't share the context. They even threw in a couple extra lies about me, like how I supposedly made up a story about my father not paying alimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked and upset when Jane told me this. As a result, I felt the need to tell her my side of the story. Thus, I had to share about my childhood, what actually happened, and that I grew up without my biological father. Unfortunately, this story is also indirectly connected to the fact that I'm essentially not in touch with anybody from my family. My father's side was absent, and my mother happens to be a narcissist. Years ago, I refused to allow her to manipulate and abuse me anymore, and that side of the family took her side. Thus, I'm sort of \"solo\" while having a lovely relationship with my teenage son.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get a bit into a spiral when I talk about these things. I just want to be transparent with who the other person is talking to. In this case, I know that Jane is very careful about who she connects with, so I just wanted to be extra transparent about some of my background. I know that there are things in my past that can be red flags to some. So, I explained my family background, how that led to some other issues along the way, that I got into therapy, started reading psychology books, and doing various mental exercises to overcome issues from my past. I'm now about 5 years out of therapy, and living a good life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made sure to also mention that I'm fine now, that I have AMAZING friends (seriously, I completely won the lottery on that front), that I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time with them and their parents when I was younger, and they served as positive role models for me. I absolutely LOVE my son and I give him more attention in a week than my father has given me in decades. I do well financially, have fun hobbies. In short, I'm good.\n",
      "\n",

      "Body text: We’ve been together 4 years, live together for 3 and I really love him so much! Our relationship is strong and we rarely argue but the times that we do I feel like he doesn’t really care about how I feel. Anytime we have an argument where I feel disrespected or he’s in the wrong he just goes silent and stares at me or his phone or literally anything else rather than actually have a conversation with me about it. It drives me insane and it makes me even more angry about the situation and it just makes it into an even bigger thing! I could understand if I was shouting at him and he didn’t wanna add fuel to the fire but I genuinely bring up these matters as calmly as possible! I grew up in a household where my parents screamed at each other over every disagreement big or small and I said I’d never be like that in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’ll just not speak and it feels like pulling teeth! And when I feel like I’m owed an apology I have to say something like “are you even sorry” and the response is almost always on the line of “well obviously I’m sorry” which honestly doesn’t feel like a real apology considering I had to basically ask for one and it’s not been said with really any remorse in his voice or tone. He’ll just avoid me until I eventually have to break the ice and change the subject and it feels like I have to basically just get over it because he’s not going to try and fix it or at least even just give me a hug or something and say sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s annoying too because if he does something that bothers me or feels disrespectful I’ll ask him why did he do it and the answer is almost always “I don’t know” which doesn’t feel like a real answer. And if I say if I did that would you like it and he says no I’ll ask again so why did you do it and again he just says I don’t know which sometimes annoys him because I keep asking the same question expecting a different answer but I just don’t believe the answer is he doesn’t know all the time. If I ever do something that bothers him or whatever I will always communicate with him and make sure he feels heard and apologise but I just don’t seem to get that same respect in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "We argued yesterday and I got all of this from him and I just refuse right now to just get over it to simply be on speaking terms when my feelings are still hurt and he’s done nothing to show he cares about that or at the very least apologise. I know some might think I’m petty for not talking but honestly I’ve just nothing to say to him right now. And it’s not like he’s made any effort to speak to me. I just don’t wanna keep arguing with basically the wall so I guess I’m just waiting and hoping he’ll act like he gives a fuck. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do and where to go from here?\n",

      "Body text: So last night me and my boyfriend had an argument about how I think that he doesn’t put any effort in towards the relationship, and he got annoyed that I was upset about that and says that I am “nitpicking” at everything he does. For context, this is my first real relationship and this is his fourth. By him not putting in any effort/not giving me what I want I mean by, when we sleepover together he won’t wake up until the last possible moment he can for when one of us needs to go to work or do something we have to so we don’t get to spend any mornings together whereas I wake up a couple hours before. I also have wrote him love letters, made a scrapbook for us, bought him things for his car to celebrate it getting fixed after 2 weeks, I have him on my lockscreen, my location is on. On the other hand, he has never done anything meaningful for me and from day one I told him every now and again I need reassurance and I only ever get it from arguing, he refuses to put his location on when Ive said its not a trust thing its more so I can be ready in time for when he comes and picks me up so I can see how far off he is, he wont put me on his lockscreen and he wont post me and his phone is always with him when we’re together and when he’s not on it’s face down. He also mentions breaking up near enough every time we have an argument when it doesn’t even cross my mind when we argue.\n",

      "The more important part of this post is that this huge argument we had, he apologised and said he will do better and I also said I would do better because I said I can’t continue in this relationship if I don’t see any change. I recently started a new job which means we don’t see each other often now as we work kind of opposite times. I got home from work today around 6pm and he has been off work all day and at home doing nothing and he is off all day tomorrow while I work 9-5. I asked him when I got home if we are going to facetime at all tonight and his response was “was gonna play xbox” despite the fact that less than 24 hours ago he agreed that he needs to put more effort in. He has had all day to play xbox and he has all night too because I will go to sleep around 11pm and he will be up until 2am. Yet if I bring up that this has annoyed me he will get annoyed at me.\n",

      "Body text: I, 17m just had my 6 month anniversary with my 17f girlfriend. I have always been a reserved person and never liked physical touch in public. In the very beginning of our relationship I hated any kind of physical touch that wasn’t private. She got really upset and we got into a huge argument. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with PDA but I am willing to compromise because that is what relationships are about. And I did. I’m ok hugging and kissing and holding hands in public now as long as it’s not too much. But she always wants to climb on me and lay on me and do all of this stuff I’m not comfortable with and we just got into another argument about it today.

      "My parents are divorced and my father is mentally unstable. A bit of a background on him... He is currently paying all the bills and rent in the apartment they both live in. I have no doubt that if he had one of his \"episodes\" any day now, he would scream and throw her onto the street. He buys food and some other necessities but the environment at home is extremely toxic and not stable at all. He has a lot of mental issues that never got resolved, as well as an addiction, and he harbors anger towards her for their divorce, despite treating her like garbage during their marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother is a grown woman but I consider her extremely vulnerable. She is not originally from America and is not extremely tech-savvy. I often have to help her with computer-related questions or just anything pertaining to social media or using her smartphone, etc. To be clear, she is able to use them on her own, but often doesn't know how to do basic functions such as how to take a screenshot, etc. things that aren't immediately obvious. I also believe she is depressed. She had an extremely difficult life prior to marrying my father and he made things even worse through emotional and psychological abuse, even financial abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "She never worked while raising me and ultimately started looking for a job a few years back. This was around the time of the divorce. She looked for whatever work she could find, and eventually was able to land a decent-paying office role with her prior experience. She worked a few temporary roles and was laid off from her most recent one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years back, she also started to get into new age beliefs and practices, which will be more relevant later. She started getting into stuff like Tony Robbins and just any famous \"motivational\" speaker, or any person who claims to know about secret knowledge to letting the universe give you what you want, stuff of that nature.\n",

      "Recently, my mom decided to stop looking for a job and open her own business. She wants to be a life coach, work from home, and not go to a boss for a paycheck. She started taking online courses from a college for this stuff and is trying to get certified in \"breathwork\". This is concerning to me on so many levels. First of all, she doesn't understand that becoming a life coach requires actual experience and certification in coaching. Otherwise, you're just another one of those figureheads on Instagram who want you to buy their book or attend their webinar on how to \"become\" a life coach. I think she went down that rabbit hole and got enticed by the idea of working for herself, and since she is on a \"self discovery journey\", she decided she'll be a life coach and help others with her positive mindset and whatnot. She didn't even know you can't mention mental health during your sessions, because that is a completely different field of work and she is not qualified whatsoever to discuss such a sensitive topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all she does is her courses, read new age books, and partake in group sessions where people discuss their feelings and how breathwork helped them. If she wants to do that, that's her choice to make. But she is playing with fire, in my opinion. I can't believe she is just okay with not looking for a job. There is no guarantee my father will let her stay with him and she would literally be homeless and have zero money. Yes, I would take her in. But she is honestly a very difficult person. She is extremely negative and broken, and it really weighs me down. I do my best to be loving and patient with her, because I love her, but she wasn't a perfect parent either. I am not really leaping at the idea of taking her in, to be honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought this up to her several times and she always has an excuse. \"Well, I can't work full-time and do school full-time. I need to devote my energy to one or the other\". I literally work full-time and attend online school full-time and have plenty of free time. Or she'll bring up how she's tired of relying on a boss for a paycheck, and you should try to be your own boss. I told her that nobody just starts a business with no income and no way to fund it, and she doesn't listen. She's convinced that her positive mindset will lead her where she needs to be. Maybe, but it's extremely nerve-wracking thinking about what could happen to her. And again, I have my own life and I have my own little family growing. I am not excited about the idea of having to support her, as harsh as that may sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need advice on how to approach this issue. I don't know if I should even bother confronting her, but I worry a lot. I think she is being incredibly naive and that she has just fallen into some kind of denial. I feel terrible and she doesn't listen to anything I say. Again, I want to reiterate that I am frustrated that 1. she is NOT looking for work and is just hoping her business idea takes off, and 2. she doesn't even have skills or experience, and just thinks that because she's into self-help and new age stuff, that she can help others. Those are my exact frustrations. Any advice would be appreciated.\n",

      "* The way she talks to me. First is the sarcasm. I have raised this twice before, and it usually stops for a while, but so far it always comes back. It can be small stuff like when I ask about when her train is again I get the whole 'ugh how have you already forgot!'. It would be fine sometimes, but it just feels relentless. I see other couples who seem to be always on each other's side, but she seems to love the opposite - always going against the other person. She only means it jokingly/sarcastically, but I don't want that. In texting she's so lovely and supportive, and then she's a completely different person when calling/talking. I just wish the texting persona could be more prevalent in real life.\n",
      "* Second is harder to define, but it's really the lack of ability for serious conversation. I'll tell her a whole story, and she'll just do a 'cutesy' childish voice and say something like 'I'm so proud of you!'. I feel she is a bit insecure about this as she recently got upset about just standing awkwardly there while we were out with my friends and not knowing what to say. But again, I just wish we could have better conversations/communication.\n",
      "* It bothers me how unhealthy she is. I keep myself fit, because I see the long term benefits. She is actually physically in good shape, I guess because she hardly eats anything, but she is constantly snacking on high-sugar foods, and never does any exercise. I have not told her this bothers me, because it seems very inappropriate to mention, as it's about her body. She doesn't have real hobbies either. I am always up to something, but she just watched tv and snacks when she's alone.\n",
      "* We recently argued when I said on the phone one night I didn't really want to continue talking because of how negative she was being towards me. It was again the sarcasm, but to me it's still negativity. She got really upset and went off about how upset she was that I wasn't so excited about going with her family on holiday this year. This was regarding a conversation from many months ago btw - I asked her why she was only raising it now, but no real answer. She then went silent for like 30 minutes, just giving short answers while I tried to talk through everything. I am a very open communicator in arguments. What bothered me the most was I could hear her typing o her phone, while being silent to me. I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to make wrong accusations, but I guess she was typing with a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of her biggest problems is her mental health. She really struggles with self-image (although she is objectively very pretty - this comes from being overweight during childhood), and she is stressed about university exams and not finding a job. Most of her negativity I know comes from a place of insecurity. For example I played tennis, then invited her, and then I got all the jokes about how I only invited her because I had to as my girlfriend. I know she's just insecure about doing something sporty, and turning the joke on me is her coping mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also really loves me. She envisions our lives together, which also scares me because I simply don't know if I do. I'm also scared of the effect it could have on her if I did end things.

      "Body text: So basically me and my gf have been a couple for around 5 months and honestly it has been one of the best times of my life. And she is one of the best people I've ever met in my life. I love this woman so much and we actually match so well and also all my friends and family just also tell me how well we match and that we seem like a match made in heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just lately our physical intimacy has kinda shifted to a point where she just doesn't want to do it anymore. I was open and decided to put all my strength together and have an open, honest talk about it where I asked her if there was something wrong. She told me it's because of her past expierences and that she tends to pressure herself so much to the point where she actually is not able to be intimate with me. So anyways, I told her that's it's completely fine and all I want is for her to feel safe and most importantly I need both of us to actually want it and I would never want sex with her if she doesn't feel like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left this convo understanding of her situation and I thought it was fine. Then when bedtime came around and she asked me to cuddle her I had a sharp sting in my chest. And I started to feel so hurt and mentally distressed because I started to feel so anxious to get horny when I am close to her and also just kind of wrong and disgusting for even wanting intimacy. I don't exactly know why but most likely it's also due to sexual trauma in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I tried to sleep but I was just having panic attacks because of it. I couldn't sleep the whole night. So as the days went on, the situation didn't really change. I still feel this sharp pain every single night and this has resulted into me actually having insomnia and me going to the doctor because I've been having severe insomnia since 3 months. (I've been getting medical treatment, seeing a psychiatrist and soon therapy). Still the situation keeps me up at night and makes me. feel so extremely guilty and selfish that I cannot cuddle my gf without being hurt myself and why I just cannot act \"normal\" and accept it without having a state of restlessness. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many nights where I don't sleep at all, even if I am not physically with her my mind keeps racing with questions. Especially when nighttime hits, everything feels worse and I stay awake the whole night just thinking if she finds me attractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I tried talking about it again in a calm, understanding setting and also being open with her why I actually have a hard time cuddling her and with my sleep. I do exactly know where she's coming from. I cannot possibly talk about it again since everytime I do, I worsen the situation because it makes her feel even more pressured seeing her partner struggle because of it. And I get it, I feel awful, I just wanna be okay with it and my body not stressing me about it anymore. The longer I don't sleep, the worse my body feels. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing I want to do is leave her. I love her so much and so wholeheartedly. And if there is literally any way of just getting through this I want to find it and get through this. I am just also so scared for my health since I literally do not sleep at all and my body is showing symptoms of sleep deprivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Also it's not her not wanting to have sex, because she does, it's just an internal pressure that she puts on herself which makes her so uncomfortable to have sex at all. And it's not her not finding me attractive, it's her feeling overwhelmed by it.)\n",

      "Body text: I (F35) and my business partner Molly (F38) started a small musical org almost 3 years ago. It began OK, but as our org has gotten busier, my trust in her has eroded: she's proven herself to be unreliable, a bad communicator, and very poor at follow-through on agreed upon tasks and schedules. \n",

      "I've tried multiple approaches to help solve for this, including multiple meetings, clearer role definitions and breakdowns, calendars, etc, all of which she agreed to in theory but not in practice. I feel like I'm the one managing things professionally, while also managing her *and* being the emotional barometer for our relationship. I'm exhausted and done, especially after the past two weeks. The problem is that we have a big week-long project coming up in less than a month, where we're partnering with another organization. **I'm trying to decide whether to tell her beforehand or afterwards that I'm stepping away.** \n",

However, if she reacts poorly then we could be in for a really rough week that could reflect poorly on us both. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context about where things are: 1.5 weeks ago, I finally professionally and firmly called her out more directly on a big bungle caused by her last-minuteness (far from the first time this kind of thing has happened). She deflected, took no responsibility for it, and tried to turn it back around on me. When I brought it back around to the issue at hand, she stopped responding. This included ignoring two other emails with time-sensitive logistical tasks that needed answers from her (including one involving our partner org), so after asking for input and receiving silence, I proceeded without her. \n",

      "Body text: I’m looking for some advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He loves me so much and wants to marry me, and I love him deeply too — it’s always been my dream to marry someone I love. But lately, there are a few things that feel off. Sometimes I wonder if I’m making a mistake or lowering my standards. And maybe he feels the same — I’m not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the things that bother me: 1.Whenever we fight, he starts cussing and calling me names.\n",
      "2.He never takes pictures of me. I know some boyfriends aren’t into photography, and that’s fair — but in my case, I’ve told him many times that it matters to me. I’ve asked him to take pictures or record small moments, not just of me, but us. He never does.\n",
      "3.He doesn’t always respect my opinions. Sometimes, I feel like there’s a subtle competition between us instead of support.\n",
      "4.On my last birthday, he didn’t even give me a gift. I understand money can be tight sometimes, and I don’t expect anything fancy (he earns) — my dad pampers me a lot and gives me everything I need, so maybe that’s why I have expectations. But I didn’t want something expensive — just flowers would’ve meant a lot. I celebrate him, so I just wish he celebrated me a little too.and \n",
      "5.I want small gestures — a flower, a note, anything. Am I expecting too much?\n",
      "6.We’ve had sex just 3 times in 3 years. But we do enjoy our fun moments, and those times are genuinely great.\n",
      "7.He never liked me having male friends, and I respected that. In all 4 years of college, I never had any male friends — even though we were in the same college.\n",
      "My issue is simple: I feel a lack of affirmation, acts of service, and respect.\n",
      "He’s called me horrible names in the past, including “sl*t.” Sometimes during fights, he says very hurtful things. He never really celebrates me. I’ve never felt seen by him. But he always wants to go out with me and spend quality time, which I genuinely enjoy. And he’s extremely loyal — no contact with any girls or anything shady. That’s one of the best things about him.\n",
      "But he’s made me feel insecure so many times. During fights, when I get emotional or throw a tantrum, he doesn’t comfort me — he never sends long texts to say sorry, never calls to express how much he loves me. I guess he’s not expressive, so I give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "Still, in fights, he tells me to go look in the mirror, or says I could do better, then the next day, he acts like nothing happened and tries to fix things. Honestly, I do give him credit — he has saved our relationship many times. But I also feel like I’m too easy to convince. We’re both deeply attached. Three years is a long time. We’ve made such good memories together. I know he loves me, and I love him too.\n",
      "But yesterday, I told him everything and broke up.We’ve never stayed away from each other for more than a day, so this is hard.Now that we’ve graduated, I’m moving to a different city for my studies, and he’s staying back. A long-distance relationship is going to be tough — especially since he doesn’t trust me. He always wants to know where I am, even though I’m a homebody and mostly go out only with family or with him. He has all my passwords. I’m not hiding anything.\n",
      "He’s truly a sweet boy, and I know he really loves me — it shows in so many ways. I love him too, deeply. But honestly, I feel like maybe it’s better for both of us to break up and take some time to be single — to grow individually and focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves.\n",
      "I truly believe that growth is important — for him and for me. We both have dreams and goals, and maybe this space will help us achieve them without distractions or emotional weight. And who knows, if destiny has its way, maybe we’ll find our way back to each other someday.\n",
      "For now, I just hope he continues to grow into a great man and becomes the kind of partner he’s truly capable of being. And I’ll focus on becoming the woman I want to be too.\n",
      "So, what should I do?\n",
      "Will I ever find someone who’s loyal like him? Or am I just too easy? Do I not deserve to be treated like I’m special — to be given that “princess treatment”?\n",
      "I don’t know. I have so much self-doubt.\n",
      "Should I leave this relationship?\n",
      "Or should I talk to him and give it one last chance and start as fresh?\n",
      "I’ve already talked to him so many times, and told him what hurts me. I know I’m not perfect — but when I love someone, I want to be pampered and cared for. Even when I push him away during fights, I hope he’d come back with respect and tell me how much he loves me — not by yelling or insulting me, but by reassuring me. I want someone who has eyes only for me, someone who adores me. I want to feel safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I’m willing to change too. For him, for us. But respect comes from the heart — and love and respect are not the same.\n",

      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. We love each other, but there’s been disrespect, lack of effort, and emotional hurt. He’s loyal, but not expressive or supportive in ways I need. I broke up with him recently because I feel we need time to grow individually, but I’m confused — am I expecting too much? Should I give him one last chance or move on?\n",

      "Body text: My friend and I were both recently laid off from our full time jobs. She had just started shortly before being laid off and spent a good chunk of her savings to move to a new city for the job.There was no relocation provided and she’s stuck with seven months left on her lease and no good way to pay it.

I want to help but after going through a layoff I’m kind of anxious about saving as much as possible in case it happens again, and $3k is a large amount of money. I was thinking to draft a promissory note asking her to give me her camera equipment and road bike (~$2800 value) and if she hasn’t paid the balance or started making payments by December then I’d sell her things and we’d consider the debt settled. The road bike is sentimental to her as it was a gift and she won a competiton on it. My other friend who I floated the idea with thinks it’s kind of a jerk move to ask for it and even suggesting it would sour the relationship. It’s the only thing she has that’s really of value and while I can imagine she’d probably want to ride it to decompress while unemployed, I also need assurance that I’m going to be made whole.

      "Body text: My bf (20m) and I (21f) have known each other for the last 6, almost 7 years. We have been together for almost three of those years, and spent the last 9 months living together in a tiny little studio flat whilst he finishes his last year at university, and I complete my second. \n",
      "This last nine months with the flat was super difficult, I was working a lot and I can be quite a handful sometimes and he would spend all of his time gaming - however he has just found himself a job and he loves it.

      "Our personalities are quite different, im quite introverted and used to be so unbelievably shy and anxious, but have since worked on that - though I’m still fairly quiet but have a few different friend groups.

We’re both stubborn and argumentative, with different opinions on things and we both kind of worry that this will impact us more down the line, like if we choose to have kids. \n",

      "Now I know we’re young, and to be fair we’ve both thought about this issue, but aren’t looking too far into the future right now.

      " I (21F) started a new degree last September. A small group of 5 people formed in our programme, and I took a lot of initiative to invite them to many events because I am the only person in the group who was not new to the city we study at. The group was very sweet and we hung out a few times. However, most of the people turned out to be not so social and eventually when I invited people only one person showed up, let's call him X (24M). At first, I liked X a lot, he is kindhearted, smart, and an interesting person. Later however a few things happened that made me feel a bit uncertain about our forming friendship, something shifted:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- he wanted to meet at least once every week and assumed that I would take him to events (makes sense, I started that pattern), but without the friend group I felt like I had to always pay attention to him at the events. Our way of partying also didn't match. I felt like he came just to talk to me and did not actually for the event. One instance I talked to my other friends much more at a party, people who I happened to vibed better with. The next day in front of another person he asked if I actually enjoyed spending time with him. I tried my best to reassure him. I guess he sensed my forming feelings but this came off very insecure and put me in a weird spot by not asking in private.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- I am his only friend in the city I think and he has implied that people from this country are not welcoming enough, which rubs me the wrong way, it is self-victimizing. He has shared a lot of troubles he has with me. this is both why I feel guilty not wanting to be there for him, but also the reason the friendship felt like work too early (but I never told him it was too much)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- once I mentioned how his personality is fun when he is drunk (without implying that it isn't he is sober) and he asked if I like this version more. I said not at all, but anyways, it doesn't matter he should only be himself. He said that it is important for him to adjust to people and he does this consciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- sometimes I find his jokes unfunny, which is completely fine, but on top of all these it makes me think we just don't click as friends\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- he told me he has anger management issues and he has been to many fights. now this is of course out of his control. but makes me feel uneasy\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very busy these days, I study, work, I have many friends who I am always happy and excited to hang out with and I am in a relationship. I also like, and want to spend time with myself and my hobbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now many months have passed (9 months), the friendship is not so new anymore and I have met him less and less frequently. He still reaches out to me. I am not sure how to handle this. I don't often end friendships and I feel like in this situation I don't have valid reasons to do so. This is a person who needs help and I got the ick partially because of this. Sometimes we still have good conversations. He has a very unique perspective on things and he has been nothing but kind to me. I think in a different circumstance I would be lucky to have him as my friend. But the more I have contemplated this, the more I think of this situation as a problem I have to solve rather than a potential friendship and this just spirals. I get nervous when he texts me nowadays.\n",

It’s been about a week, and I’ve been feeling like this isn’t what I want. He feels that my emotions are too much for him to deal with and that I need to get ‘hobbies’ that aren’t missing him. He doesn’t like when I ask him when I’ll see him next because it ‘makes him feel like I don’t care about him getting better for himself’. If I say I miss you too many times he says it feels redundant and that it’s unhealthy and I’m obsessive over the relationship and him. He believes that I didn’t take enough time to mentally prepare myself for him being gone whereas he feels like he properly mentally prepared himself so he “doesn’t spend half of his time thinking about how he misses me”.

      "Body text: Sorry this is long but: \n",
      "\n",
      "I 27F need advice about a relationship with a 30M. Long story short, we dated for a little over 2 years, but we are now broken up and I'd say we're still friends. Flash back to when we were dating: like most relationships everything started off good, but about a year in issues started. I was working full time and trying to figure out what to do with my life. I was (and still am) stressed. I am the one who told him how I was feeling and felt like a relationship was not in my best interest at the moment. Not only was stress a big factor in me deciding to end the relationship but also because my partner went through a spell of quitting his job and just spending most of his days sleeping, playing videos games and becoming depressed. I could tell he was becoming more depressed and I tried my best to help. I made sure he was fed, taking care of himself and I would see him almost every day after work. There were times where I had to tell him I couldn't come see him after work because either I had plans with some friends or had things I had to get together for myself at home. The days I couldn't see him, he would get really upset with me and we would argue but I really needed a break. This cycle went on for at least 8 months. I was completely burnt out, exhausted my bank account buying food everyday and just felt not myself. I felt like he wasn't trying to get better even though I was supporting him and I know depression is a sensitive and tricky subject but I feel like I tried my best to show him I was there but instead burnt myself out in the process. I've always been the kind of person to put others over myself but I'm learning how to not be that person to a certain extent. After the breakup, he did get a job and he started to be in a better place mentally. I ended up getting all my stuff together and am now in school getting my master's degree and working full time. My partner is working full time as well now but still has no clear direction where his life is headed. We've had the conversation about what he wants out of life and for the years I've known him is been the same answer of \"idk\". \n",
      "\n",
      "He tried (and is still trying) to rekindle the relationship but I have told him multiple times that I do not have romantic feelings for him. We're good as friends and that's where I'd like to stay. And this is where the problem is. \n",
      "\n",
      "We argue. ALL THE TIME. I told him I don't want to talk everyday, I'm cool with catching up every now and then and honestly if he did reach out everyday and the conversation was short I wouldn't mind, however, he expects me to text him back quick, answer every phone call and talk for hours everyday. I have school and work to deal with, along with other life things I have to get together too. If I don't talk to him his text to me get more and more angry about how I'm rude for not replying or ignoring him, but if I don't ignore him some days we'll talk all day everyday and I do not want that. I have talked to him in person about this and over text. He wants to hang out frequently and I do not. Which is something I have also expressed to him. When I don't hang out with him he gets upset with me and if we're together in person and doesn't \"get his way\" ( like I had to tell him to stop touching me in certain ways) he gets visibly pouty and upset like a toddler which I have called him out for. He's even pulled up to my house before without asking me first because I wasn't responding to him which I told him made me extremely uncomfortable and he knows that and I feel like he'll try to say stuff like \"I'm gonna pull up to your house\" just so I can respond to him because he knows I don't like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to add that I am not perfect in this situation either. Some days I'll tell him I'll call him before bed but I either fall asleep before I call or sometimes I really don't feel like being on the phone so I just don't call. ( I would love to be able to just tell him this, but it always leads to an argument so sometimes it's just easier to not call at all). And sometimes when we are on the phone and I don't want to be sometimes I can get snappy or not very involved in the conversation but I feel like a lot of the time he's not talking, just sitting in silence or playing his game and then gets upset at me for not \"talking enough\" or having a conversation and then he wants to talk to next day since he feels the conversation wasn't enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year I told him that I do want to talk anymore and I think it's best we go our separate ways...he was not cool with that and wanted a \"final conversation\" which I agreed to because I felt he wanted closure and I was okay with giving him that. We picked a date to have our final conversation and that date never came and when I would bring it up and remind him that he's the one who wanted a final conversation he never would pick a new date and would just blame it on the fact that he didn't know what my schedule looked like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also a big factor in us breaking up is I felt and still feel like I have to do most things for him. He never really tries to figure stuff out on his own and when I ask him to try it's always \"idk what that is \" or \"idk how to do that\" and honestly I'm frustrated and stressed. I am a very independent person and even if I do need help I'll at least try to figure it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends have been telling me to just block him and I don't want to be rude, however, he is the only constant stressor currently in my life and I'm coming to realize that I would be okay if we never talked again. I don't want to feel like someone's mom. I want a boyfriend, not a child as a partner. I feel like I have stated my boundaries over and over and yes I know I should be better at enforcing them because I do feel like he's learned he can step over my boundaries sometimes which doesn't help the issue so feel free to touch on that in the comments as well. I'm also trying to grow from this. \n",
      "\n",

We are still friends but he wants constant contact and I do not which I have expressed. I feel he still wants a relationship and I do not, which I have also expressed. None of my boundaries are respected by him.Don't want to be rude and block him but I'm becoming stressed out from the constant arguments. HELP. \n",

      "Title: Issues in marriage\n",
      "Body text: My husband (38M) told me (37F) that he feels unappreciated, unattached and is not sure “that we are meant to be”.  I asked him if he still wants to be married and he said he doesn’t  know. We have been together for 12yrs and married for 2 with a 5yr old child. I was his first girlfriend. He has only been in situationships  prior to meeting me. He doesn’t like to discuss his feelings and only talks when I initiate a conversation. He barely talks to me throughout the day and we only spend time together when we watch our favorite show on Fridays. We don’t date often and typical only go out a few times a year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our conversations are usually dry but he becomes very jovial when his friends or family call him. He is either glued to the TV, his phone or his PS5. I ask him to spend 20 or 30 minutes with me when I get home from work and he says he doesn’t want to talk because he needs time to destress after work and likes to play when his friends are online. (FYI,  He arrives home 2 hours before I get home from work). He says he is overwhelmed with picking our child up from school and reports that he does a lot to make sure that she is fed (it’s usually and happy meal and our child usually entertains herself or is glued to her tablet). His interactions with our child are very minimal at times. He doesn’t clean or help me do anything in the house but will jump up and help others with their house. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am stuck in an emotionless marriage and not sure what to do. He doesn’t  touch me and will only be interested I initiate sex. He doesn’t initiate sex with me anymore. He does give me a kiss and when he leaves and when I return but that pretty much it. I think most of the issues he has may have may be within him self and not me. I do a lot to support him and our household and I’m not sure what else I can do at this point. I asked him what can be done to make our relationship better, he reply was cook more and head!!!!! I also need to add that he has leaned on me a lot financially since I met him and I also paid for our wedding by myself. He started to support the household more last year. He pays the mortgage and a few bills, I pay the rest and pay for everything regarding my daughter except we share daycare expenses.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He recently started a weightless journey and is only focused on him self and his friends he works out with. He also recently started making a little more money and is less dependent on me. Just would like an outsider’s perspective about our situation. Sorry to be long winded and all over the place but I don’t have a lot of safe spaces to vent. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’m looking for some outside perspective on a situation that’s been bothering me for a while. I’ve been with my girlfriend (27F) for almost a year and a half now, and overall things are not always going well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s one thing that keeps nagging at me: her relationship with her male best friend (27M). I’ve met the guy once — he seems like a decent, geeky guy and from what I can tell, he’s respectful. That said, some past details of their friendship are making me uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we started dating, the two of them went to a sex club together. She told me about it openly, and reassured me that nothing happened between them — she said she’s never been attracted to him, and that he’s never seen her naked. I believe her, and I want to trust that. But still, that kind of shared experience is not something I can easily brush off.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, she once casually admitted that they spooned in bed one time — again, before we were together. No sex involved, just cuddling. But even so, it’s hard for me to reconcile that level of physical and emotional intimacy with their friendship. I've also noticed a strong sense of complicity between them and I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me feel a bit on edge as her partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I’m not trying to control who she’s friends with, and I appreciate her honesty. But I’m starting to wonder if I need to draw some boundaries here for the sake of my own emotional comfort. I’m not sure if I’m being insecure or if this is a valid concern to bring up.\n",

      "I (17F) have only been with my boyfriend, we’ll call him Tray (18M), for 3 months (it’ll be 4 tomorrow on the 20th), but I’m thinking about ending it. Various things keep piling up and I just don’t know if I can handle it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started smoking together and added our mutual friend, we’ll call him Felix (18M), to the sesh. A little backstory about my relationship with Felix. I met him when I started my first job. He was new in town and dating someone that I knew from school before I left. (I’ve been homeschooled since 2022 by my choice.) I didn’t like her because I had known her to be a cheater since the beginning of middle school. I warned him about her, and slowly, we started talking about our relationships. When I started my job, I was with another guy. We’ll call him Sebastian (17M). Felix was there for me the most out of anyone. When I was having a problem in my relationship, I wanted Felix. He listened, he was understanding, he was honest, and he was just real. When Sebastian and I broke up, Felix held me while I cried and told me it was going to be okay. He looked into my eyes, like REALLY looked into my eyes, and told me it was going to be okay and that I was going to get through it and everything was going to get better. Needless to say, Felix is a great guy, an even greater friend, and the BEST smoke buddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a little backstory about how my relationship with Tray started. I met him my first day of work. He was a customer. He came in everyday, and I took a liking to him. One day, after my shift, I sat with him, and we had a great time. It was like we had been friends for years. I, at the time, was with Sebastian. Eventually, me and Sebastian broke up, and Tray and I got together literally two weeks after. It was a 7 month relationship with Sebastian, and I know that was a bad decision on my part. I should’ve waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the main story, Tray, Felix, and I started smoking together. I don’t know how to explain it, but for some reason when Tray smokes, he just loses control of himself. He’s either nonverbal, or he can’t hold a conversation because he’s just making stupid jokes and comments that don’t have anything to do with the conversation. He does this during every conversation, including the serious ones. Oftentimes, when we smoke together, Felix tells us about how he’s feeling in his relationship and seeks help and advice from us. While Felix is venting and looking for support, Tray is interrupting to make a stupid comment, related or unrelated, or a joke that isn’t at all appropriate for the conversation. I find this to be very unattractive. You don’t lose control of yourself from smoking the herb, especially if you’ve been smoking consistently for a while, so he is more than able to act right in those moments. I’ve even brought it to his attention because it caused a rift in our relationship, and nothing has really changed. I can tell it upsets Felix sometimes by the way he responds and the look on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second I started smoking with Tray it just all went downhill honestly. I feel like I saw another version of him. A more real version of him. After I realized how unattractive and frustrating it really was, everything snowballed. I started to notice other things that I didn’t like. I ended up talking to him and telling him everything that was bothering me. The way he shut down and wouldn’t talk for HOURS when we had issues. Literally would sit there in silence for hours until I said something, even if he was in the wrong. He wouldn’t talk, wouldn’t touch me, wouldn’t even move unless he had to. 9 times out of 10, when we had a problem, it ended with me fuming and him sleeping because he would just sit there silently until he fell asleep. I told him I missed being single. I told him I needed an emotionally strong man. Not someone that cowers when I’m frustrated or shuts down or gives me sad eyes or anything like that. I told him I needed someone that wasn’t so soft with me all the time. I don’t always want to be loved on. I grew up, not only in abusive households, but with a very stoic and manly father. While my dad (40M) is a HORRIBLE person, outside of the abuse, he is the perfect man. Strong, protective of his family, successful, smart, handy, etc. I want that in a man. I made sure to tell him that there’s nothing wrong with him being a soft person, it’s just not what I need in a relationship. I told him that it’s his choice. I told him that I did not want him to change if he felt like it wasn’t worth it or he didn’t want to. I also told him that, I’m the one that wants him to change these things, so I’ll be here for him throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "That pretty much catches us up to now. The other day, we were on the way to pick up Felix. I saw a turtle in the road, stopped, went to go move it, saw it was half crushed, but alive, called my mom, took it home, put it in a box, and when I went to get in my car, I handed him the box. When I went to hand him the box, he started complaining and I immediately cut him off and said “Can you not?” because he already had an attitude about the detour. I started driving and said “I’m sure you’d want someone to fucking help you if you were half crushed in the middle of the road unable to do anything.” He then said that he just didn’t want to have to hold the box, which to me is so unattractive and makes me feel disgusted towards him. There’s a half crushed turtle dying in a box that I’m trying to take to the rehabilitation center TEN FUCKING MINUTES AWAY and you’re gonna cry about having to hold the box? Oh my gosh. Maybe it’s because he grew up more in town and I grew up in the country, so I love animals, but that behavior is so gross to me. That was strike one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike two happened when he didn’t take me to prom. I’ve been waiting to go to prom since my brother (21M) won prom king and queen with his girlfriend that he is still with and has been with since 7th grade. I’ve never really liked school dances. They’re crowded, hot, loud, my feet always end up hurting, finding a dress is always a pain, but the people are great. I’m a tomboy and I always have been, so when I’m given the opportunity to dress up and look all pretty, I LOVE to take it. Especially when I have a handsome guy to stand next to and look good with. Tray and I went to homecoming together, he told me he was going to ask me to prom, but then one day Felix asked if we were going and Tray said no. I was so upset. Either way, we didn’t end up going, and I’m honestly still devastated. Why wouldn’t you want to go to a dance with your girlfriend and show her off? I don’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike three happened last night. 2 days ago, Tray and I were going to make buckeyes together. We didn’t end up doing it, so yesterday we went to the store and I spent $20 on the ingredients. We got to my house, and Tray didn’t do anything to help with the first half of the buckeyes (making the peanut butter balls). He just sat on a chair playing a game or something on his phone after he finished eating the strawberry cobbler my mom had made. When it came time to do the second half of the project, (melting the chocolate and dipping the pb balls) he again just sat on his phone while I melted the chocolate. Then, I dipped the first ball into the chocolate, twisted it around, picked it up, let it drip a little, and before I could even set it down, he says from behind me “Okay I’ve seen you do one” and then literally just left. Didn’t say anything else, didn’t come back, nothing. Just left me to do the rest of them myself. Didn’t even at the very least stay to talk to me. Never came in to check and see how I was doing, never yelled from the other room, literally nothing. I finally finished them after about half an hour and went out into the living room, which is the room he was in, to wait for the chocolate to solidify. I wasn’t mad or anything despite his previous actions, so I sat with him and turned on a movie. He didn’t watch any of the movie either, he just fell asleep. I just continued watching the movie until it was time to try a completed buckeye. I woke him up, asked him if he wanted one, and he didn’t answer me. I asked multiple times, no answer. I decided to just get up and grab two. One for both of us. I handed him his, and he eventually took a bite. Didn’t say anything about it, didn’t thank me, didn’t anything, but whatever, because he was eating it. The rest of it was just sitting in his hand and he was falling asleep again, so I started trying to wake him up, but he kept falling back asleep, so I said “Tray, you need to wake up baby,” and he finally stood up. I had told him about 3 times already that he needed to eat the rest of the buckeye because it was going to melt. He incoherently said something in a distressed/annoyed/whining voice. I told him again that he needed to eat it because it was going to melt, and he turned around and started walking to the kitchen. Confused, I followed him. I asked what he was doing, but I didn’t get a response. He just continued walking, until he got to the trash can, where he threw the buckeye away. I said “What are you doing?!,” very frustrated at this point as I hadn’t caught an attitude and had been extremely sweet to him the entire time up to this point. He said that it was melting, which immediately pissed me off even more because I had told him multiple times it was going to melt if he didn’t eat it faster. I just turned around, went upstairs, put my boots on, grabbed my keys, and walked out of the house. I sat in the car until he came out of the house and got in the car. I took him home, and when we got there, I had my car still in drive, with my foot on the brake waiting for him to get out. Usually I park my car so I can relax and talk to him a little and properly tell him bye, but when I’m frustrated, I leave it in drive so I can just leave. He didn’t move, eventually asking me what was wrong, so I put my car in park, looked at him, and brought up everything he had done. He apologized, but it didn’t mean anything to me. He also said “You could’ve told me what to do” which immediately infuriated me. I was already doing everything that we were supposed to be doing together and now he wants me to control his actions too? His Face ID is in my phone, he was watching me look at the instructions on my phone. He could’ve put in a little effort to just look at the fucking phone, especially since that’s what he was going to do anyway when he sat down to play on his. At some point, nobody had said anything so I asked him what he was doing. He said he was thinking of something to say and I said there’s nothing to be said. He said something else that I can’t remember and then I said “We’re just sitting here in silence, and my car is running. I want to go home” he grabbed all of his stuff, muttered something that I didn’t hear, and then slammed the fuck out of my car door for some reason. He knows that I don’t like my doors being slammed for multiple reasons. It’s bad for the doors, I got yelled at for it growing up so it’s very triggering, and it’s really loud in the car, especially because I have sensitive hearing and noises like that are very sharp to me. I was shocked at what he’d just done, so I sat there for a few seconds before driving off. He texted me this morning saying “I firstly want to apologize for not doing anything to help you make the buckeyes, I just didnt know how to make them and i wasn’t thinking and started wandering but thats not an excuse for me to not stay with you to at least talk to you. I am sorry for throwing your buckeye out because i didn’t want it, its not that it was bad i just didn’t want it and didn’t say that. I also want to apologize for slamming your door, as much as i meant to, it was wrong of me to do when I made you upset.” “And good morning, i love you and cant wait to see you later” I don’t know what to do or say because I don’t forgive him in the slightest, and a big part of me wants to break up with him.\n",

      "TLDR: I (17F) don’t like the way my boyfriend (18M) has been acting and treating me and other things lately. He’s complained about having to hold a box that had a half crushed, but alive turtle in it while I drove to the rehab center, didn’t take me to prom, and left me to make a dessert that we were supposed to make together, by myself. (Not all in the same day) After the dessert was finished, I gave him some, and he didn’t give me any feedback. Just took one small bite, complained that it was melting after I told him it was going to if he didn’t eat it faster, and threw it away. Then he slammed my car door because I was upset that he threw my dessert away.\n",

      "Body text:  Boyfriend [36M] unsure of relationship with me [30F] after almost a year. When we started dating a year ago he told me that he is looking for marriage and children and that is his goal. After maybe 8 months he left me due to his mental health and not being able to meet my needs. We seperate for a couple months and he came back telling me he feels a lot better and is ready to put me as a priority and I gave him another chance. He is in the military is supposed to be moving to another country for years in 5 months and asked me to basically get married come with him and live with him there. I would be uprooting my whole life and my career to go but I agreed because that’s what love is. Now after one and half months being back together again, I posed the question of where he is at in the relationship and why he isn’t really making any plans or helping me plan for moving. (And also is never saying he’s excited). He basically answered with that he’s unsure of me again and unsure he can handle a marriage and put others first above him (me and future kids). He brought up a long distance relationship from that country instead of committing to me. He also brought him “let’s just wait a little longer to see if I’m unsure still”. I left. Is he showing a clear example of him stringing me along?\n",

This was literally a conversation today. we were talking normally about how i dont have to like the people that he spoke about me to cuz they formed an opinion on me without actually talking to me (which he says im egotistical and self centred for saying so) and he rose his voice to the point that the app we were talking on cut off a few words cuz of the change in volume. \n",

      "no matter how hard i try to communicate, it feels like it goes in one ear and out the other. he says that im trying to be manipulative by saying anything or defending myself and he calls me a narcissist. he dictates what im upset about and then yells at me for it. again i am in no means innocent. i have yelled, started fights, cussed back at him. but it feels like for every attack i throw, he launches an army at me. i see him posting about me in other subreddit and he sends me screenshots from the bpd servers where he spoke about us and letting people talk shit about me when ive been so worried to talk to anyone cuz it wouldnt be fair to only tell my side of things but im at my wits ends here.  \n",

I have done so much for this person that i really dont know who i am anymore. I had to beg for everything in this relationship too, from personal time to time with him. its hard to see eye to eye anymore. its hard to get a word in. he says im a red flag for not trying in the relationship but it really feels like his version of me trying is sitting there to accept whatever hurtful word he throws my way and apologizing.\n",

      "\n",
      "One recurring issue is the way we remember things differently. Often, when something goes wrong, he tells the story in a way that makes it sound like I lashed out for no reason. But to me, those moments had build-up. I’m not saying I handled them well — I didn’t. I can own that. I didn’t always deescalate. I’ve interrupted. I’ve reacted before thinking. I have a hard time stopping myself when I feel overwhelmed or triggered. But I also know that the way he tells the story and reorders the details and context — things like a certain tone, a dismissive remark, or a pattern of behavior that led to my reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says I didn’t bring up  important issues when they needed to be discussed. But I was scared. Not necessarily of him — but of how loud things would get, how quickly the energy would shift, how I’d have to brace myself even if the yelling wasn’t directed at me. It still felt threatening. It’s hard to open up and speak calmly when your body feels like it’s in fight or flight. I didn’t stay silent because I didn’t care. I stayed silent because I was overwhelmed, trying to avoid escalation, or already shutting down emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also says I was wrong or dramatic for not being able to get over the yelling or the raised tone — even if he was just excited. But my nervous system doesn’t care if it’s anger or excitement. It just hears *volume* and reacts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, I’ve started to doubt myself. Did it happen that way? Am I rewriting things to suit my emotions? But I don’t think that’s it. I think I’m trying to hold on to the full picture — not just the part where I lose my cool, but everything that led to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again I haven’t always responded kindly. I’ve been passive-aggressive. I’ve escalated situations. I’ve cut in. I’ve pushed when maybe I should’ve paused. I take responsibility for that. I’m not trying to frame myself as a victim. I’m trying to be honest about the complexity.\n",

      "What I’m struggling with now is how much of what I feel is real, and how much of it has been worn down by constant self-questioning. He’s not a bad person. But am i abusive? am i truly the most ugly person he has ever encountered? he says he's only here cuz he doesn't have the self-respect to think he can get better. What can i do? i don't want to leave this man, how do i become better when the history is so tainted and I have 0 support and working with a scared ticking time bomb?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend (recently diagnosed with BPD) and I have had a very emotionally intense relationship for 2+ years. I stayed through the yelling, threats, and emotional volatility, and eventually started reacting with anger too. I’ve done things wrong — been passive-aggressive, escalated fights, struggled with accountability — and I’m trying to work on that. But his words have been deeply cruel, and his therapist thinks I’m the abusive one. I’m trying to figure out: am I really the abuser here, or just someone who's been worn down over time? I don’t want to paint myself as innocent, I just need clarity on what’s really happening.\n",

      "Body text: Hey. \\[I am M, a College Freshman, 20\\] is in a complex dynamic with another \\[M, Freshman, 20\\] right now. I’m lowkey confused. Age similarities because both Ms took gap years, and F is Soph (below)\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarise, around orientation, our friend group started off as three, because I met \\[M, Freshman\\] and then invited \\[F, Sophomore, 20\\] to hang out. Six weeks in, I had a gut feeling and started to realize that the two of them were unknowingly leaving me out, because they were texting separately and are now dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, M also starts being mean to me, and suspects that I am interested in him, as a defensive mechanism to push me away. (I clarified and have mentioned in passing before that I’m straight, I just prefer 1-1 hang outs in our friendship, partly because I feel left out).\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven weeks in, we talk it out since I found out they are now dating. M talks to me about what he feels, I tell him about how he made me feel as a friend, and we ‘talk’ it out. Everything seems ok, albeit awkward. I told him I’m in college and I want to be tight with someone, hustle and grind together. I don’t want to be taken for granted in a friendship, and I feel left out in the group of 3, and don’t think I’d want to hang out in groups of 3 ever again, because it just felt like M and F was using me to get close to each other. He apologises, and asks me to give him a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today, things seem pretty messy. It’s kinda like how trust is broken and can never be the same? I don’t hate him per se, but I enjoy hanging out with him. I have other friends and hang out, but I feel like I don’t get the same prioritization from him per se. Ever since we had the first conversation, he has been putting in effort and trying to be better, but it still feels lacklustre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last semester, I hate how when I ask to hang out he’ll always say no and say he has X Y Z things planned. So to make up for this uncertainty he suggests we meet at a same predetermined time every week. Sounds fair, but this is a major cut down from how often we used to meet \\[either just me, or with me and F\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "Also it’s kind of like a weird dynamic? He tries to bring us \\[me and F\\] together, but I just have no interest. I think F is manipulative, and sort of try to befriend me then to get close to M, but on the surface we just remain cordial. So what happens then is that it creates a weird dynamic where he has to choose between me or F. Which even though I wish we’d spent more time together \\[separately\\], I told him I understand and have also told him to go hang out with F at parties or at events where we’re both there together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m okay and I’m happy with him being with F, but what pisses me off is him making it so obvious that I’m not a priority? Like I asked M to hang out with me at one party, and he said no, he’s going with F. But when he found out that F is going to that same party but with her friends, he finally wants to hang out with me. This is what gets me, and it’s something that I just cannot tolerate (or rather, have tried to, but it gets to me).\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think I should do? Just distance myself slowly? Or talk it out? If we do talk it out it’s like our third or fourth time talking it out. This is like a major summarised version but yes. Also I do have other friends, I just love and appreciate M’s company when things do work out, but it’s just pmo because of this not prioritising situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, I know this is a lot, but its just been a confusing moment in life? I don't hate them, it's just that after I found out they got together (partly because of me? but excluded me) F gives me the ick, and Ms' behavior just gets me. I realize and reflect that this might also be an avoidant (him) vs anxious (me) attachment style?\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I suspected M and F used me to get together, which ended up being true. F gives me ick, so I distance, and M apologises for being mean to me. Over time, our priorities and expectations change, so there's a conflict about mismatch in expectations and prioritization. Do I hold on or let go? Or fade?\n",

      "Body text: So my girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) recently got back together after dating for a year and breaking up. Since getting back together, things have been rocky—we argue about small things almost daily, and it’s really starting to wear me down.\n",

      "After our breakup, she started dating another guy. During that time, one of her friends got into a serious accident. My best friend, who was dating that injured friend, posted photos and wrote supportive messages about her.

      "\n",
      "For context, I usually do try to be in her corner. I listen to both sides, but I almost always try to understand and support her.

      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My GF (18F) and I (18M) got back together recently, but we’ve been arguing constantly. She’s now mad at me for not defending her during a fight she had with my best friend while we were broken up and she was dating someone else.

      "Body text: Dated this girl for 3 months and it was insane. Best relationship I ever had, so passionate and intimate. We both liked each other a lot and connected so well. She just broke up with me. Caught me blindsided, she had some issues with me not “opening up to her” about some things I was dealing with. The two main issues she had was she hadn’t met my parents yet (yes 3 months is still pretty new) but her argument was I already knew hers from early on. And she said she knew I was going through something but didn’t know what until I finally did open up about the complications with my mom’s cancer. She felt horrible for me, but tried to say this whole time she involved me with every aspect of her life and this whole time I left her in the dark. She felt like I was hiding something. I explained that I’m slow to fully trust anymore, I used to put blind trust in people early in the past and it’s always backfired. I told her I’d bring her home to meet the folks and assured her I had nothing to hide. My friends take on this was that she sounds manipulative but I really didn’t get that impression (being in the full context) yeah I did have some fault in all of this and I realize it now. A week later she broke up with me. She said she needs to work on getting over some problems from her past and needed to be alone. She said I needed to work on things too. She mentioned that she does “really really like me” and that I make her so happy but she just “can’t do this right now” when we broke up we talked for 3 hours. It was a very emotional conversation, we both heard each other. Neither of us got mad or lost our cool. We even shared a few laughs. She left it at, “Not never but not now, maybe we can try being friends and ease back into things after I have some time to myself” \n",
      "When she left we exchanged a very long hug. \n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify I am 95% positive she is not going to be talking to or entertaining other men during this time but I did not ask. I am going to give her some space in the hopes that she soon comes around and reaches out. I truly believe we moved too fast and things got real fast and it scared her. I figured I’ll give it 6 ish weeks and if I haven’t heard back I might reach out and see if she wants to catch up over coffee. She even went as far as to say I can still txt or call when I’m having a bad day and she doesn’t want me out of her life. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m still just confused about the whole situation but I understood her well and I somewhat understand why she feels the way she does… I just would have though she’d try to work through things together with how well we connected.

      "Body text: (TLDR at bottom)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I 14NB and my ex-best friend 15F haven't spoken outside of professionalism in 3 months. Since we share classes and clubs there is still the occasional question or request, but nothing personal. (Except for today but I'll get to that later) I don't necessarily want to fix things, that ship has sailed, but I do want to find closure for both of our sakes, our anxiety and our parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all started around spring break, where we both went on vacation, me to Europe and her to Japan. Over the course of our 2 week vacations we texted for avg over 1 hour per day. In addition to this, there was also common facetime calls to check in on each other. Now, I had literally never had anyone care about me this much (or seem to anyways) basically ever, not anyone I had ever considered a best friend, not therapists, not my parents. And, that's at no fault of their own, they are all good people but you know how teens are with there parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, during these 2 weeks I started to develop a pretty big crush on her, and I showed it in my texting, being pretty obvious, flirting, calling her cute, VERY clear messaging. And, at the time at least, I thought it was being reciprocated. She responded in kind, flirtatious jokes, messages, subtleties, etc. And I may not be the best at social cues but she was reciprocating I swear But, I thought I was crazy so I asked my sisters, one of whom being a practiced \"Flirt\". (Her words not mine). And, both of them told me that there was a near certain chance that she liked me. So, I set out to tell her, arranging a time the Monday after we returned (AKA the first day of school back). And this was my first mistake. Jet lag, other problems she had that I literally had no way of knowing about and I guess more problems we both had lead to what was, verbally, the perfect confession. Unfortunately, verbally isn't just how things work. I may have said the right words, but through the tears, the pauses and the timings in which I said them made it worse than the time I got my friend to tell someone I liked that I liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assumed (since I thought I knew this girl it was literally the perfect friendship) that it'd take a few days, maybe a week for her to come to terms with it and that we could then start being friends again, starting slowly and moving up to something more, well, friendly. I knew I could do this as one of the only things I am good at is moving on from being rejected, and I was over it in like 3 days. What I was not over however, was the fact that I thought I had hurt her so effing badly. She hadn't come to school in a week, wasn't replying to my texts asking if she was okay. For all I knew, she was dead. So, after like a week of me spending all day on my bed crying my eyes out (again, not cause of the rejection, cause I was scared I had hurt her) I shot her another text essentially saying that \"Its pretty fucking clear you hate me know, I just want to make sure you're okay and then you don't have to talk to me ever again\". And, I waited. Waited for a while. I sent a follow-up \"I know I hurt you and I just want to say that I'm here if you need me and I want you to feel better about *everything.* Now we come to my next mistake. Because she had told me she wanted space but my anxiety ridden brain was telling me \"You caused a problem so fix it you asshole\". So, I did. I kept texting her, bi-daily, until my thick head finally got the message. Something that also helped me get the message was her calling me selfish, despite the only thing I wanted for myself was for her to feel better?? Still genuinely confused abt that. So, I sent one final text, leading with \"This will be my final contact unless you reply. I know when I am not wanted. Insert me saying I'm here if she needs me, not here if she isn't, that I just want to help, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, she told me that she did still want to be friends and just wanted to take it slowly. So I did. I stopped texting her, I went back to school and I was normal, I talked to her if I saw her but was careful not to overstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "FF 2 months ish later and she literally hasn't said a fucking word to me at all. Now, context for this next part, we are both in the yearbook club and since I had a free block and I saw a couple of the members (her being one of them), I asked if there was anything I could work on for it. (we are super behind so time is of the essence). The other guy said \"No I don't know\". I then turned to her, asked her the same. Her exact words were \"If I wanted you to do something I probably would just do it myself.\" Obviously a shot. And, a cruel one at that. Not only implying that I'm useless, but that she is better than me at whatever it is I was going to try and do. And, what did I do?? I turned, tears in my eyes (literally) away from her and said \"Thanks\" sarcastically. To no response. Looking back on it now, It would have been much more satisfying to curse her out and call her on all the shit she's put me through. (3 months of literally having 0 people to talk to, not even casually, 3 months of suicidal thoughts, 3 months of my anxiety spirally like nothing else, 2 months of depression controlling me, 3 months of me being an asshole to everyone I know, 3 months of contemplating how many of my other relationships were so fragile that a couple of texts could break them, 3 months of pain.)

Basically tensions were high from a fight the previous day and I told him if we are going to hang out I don’t want to fight because it’s my first weekend off in 3 months. He agreed. That same night we went out to the store and he was being mopey and I asked what’s wrong. He said we should really talk about the fight. I said I wil talk about it but I don’t want to fight and will only talk about it if he is willing to listen to my side and not become defensive. He wasn’t too thrilled I said this and did not really agree or disagree. He never brought it up. That night we were watching a movie and I put subtitles on a movie and I noticed they were in French and he was trying to get the pause sign to go away and moved the mouse. I also noticed at the same time it’s in French and said move and switched to English. He said it’s crazy that I put the subtitles on without asking him and demanded I take them off because he hates subtitles. He said “you don’t just go to someone’s house and touch their computer and put subtitles on”.  I replied what about me? Because  I have a hard time watching movies without subtitles and this has been going on for 5 years. I was honestly shocked he said that and just let it go but watched the movie in silence and went to bed. Fast forward to the next morning I wanted to tell him why I wasn’t being affectionate due to the previous nights events. He immediately blew up and went on about how I’m wrong for touching the computer. I said I don’t want to argue as it’s my weekend off and he kept going so I said I want to leave. He needed to drive me home and told me to get my sister to come pick me up. He kept emphasizing how what I did is as if I go into a car and turn the ac on, and that that is the drivers job, and how turning the subtitles on is the same idea and he would never do that. I said that I am his gf of 5 years I should be treated a bit different than a stranger. He kinda got it but he laughed while I cried, said I’m unbearable and fucked up and that I shouldn’t talk to him ever again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now he has avoidant tendencies and has a lot of criticism coming from his parents so I get he’s under pressure to any type of criticism lately. However, I do not want to tolerate this kind of fighting anymore because it happens far too often, and I won’t be called names. \n",
      "I ended up leaving his house before 9am and walking to a store to have my sister pick me up. We haven’t spoken since and I’m not sure what to make of this and how to reach out eventually if I do. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; my bf and I of 5 years got into a fight over subtitles and our communication has been very bad lately. I left his house because of the ridiculous nature of the fight and we haven’t spoken since. \n",

      "Title: how to get over (worst scenario) first love\n",
      "Body text: not gonna go through the entire thing-  but short story- i’m 4 years younger than him and was completely inexperienced while he is VERY experienced (we are both legal don’t worry) so it started him pursuing me, very innocently. the entire time, he was gentle and did everything innocently with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "i knew we could never amount to anything because he would be graduating and i just started. we’d go our separate ways in a few months and it’d be over. (college btw). but, you know how it goes. \n",
      "\n",
      "skip forward, he’s seen me now without my clothes, did sexual things (not sex yet and he never forced me), asked me to be his girlfriend, bought me flowers, cuddled me, surprised me all the time. he told me how he “wanted to show me what a beautiful smart and pretty girl deserved” he wanted to be the best and set the standard. \n",
      "then. i found out he had a girlfriend at home. he has been on and off with her, but they were currently dating. he tried to break up with her after meeting me but didn’t finish breaking up when the girl tried to save the relationship, so he continued but it was dead (confirmed by both him and the girl) and they finally broke up after i found out. still was mega depressed. but because i’d done so many things with him i’ve never done i was so heartbroken, i missed him deeply. he showed me over and over he was desperate to fix things so i agreed to at least allow him to tell me what happened after being cold for a few days, and gradually i warmed back up to him because it felt too impossible to be mad. now we were back to dating but without the label. he knew i was upset and i can tell he views me as someone innocent and small and it hurts to know this. i’ve never gone through a single part of this good or bad relationship stuff before. i knew he was bad, but i knew he loved me, he did things you only do when you’re truly in love, came to my window in the middle of the night and we’d sneak out, handmade me a necklace, took me to the hospital and took care of me when i was ill, rocked me back and forth and played with my hair- but i think he also is able to love fast and easily, and im just another person that he loves if that makes sense. \n",
      "he talked about how he would wait for me for years, even just to see my face again once he left. he wanted to continue but i told him we couldn’t. i am still hurt by his lies. \n",
      "and this is bad on me- but because he deceived me, i went through texts on his phone and saw a suspicious text from someone i don’t know, she was saying “i know you want to continue talking but im still trying to get over everything that happened” \n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT???? i didn’t ask because i figured, “why?” this will be over beyond control in a few weeks, but i truly love him. \n",
      "\n",
      "he even texts the now ex-gf i mentioned, but he is so dismissive towards her that you can tell he doesn’t care. which i think says something bad about him, one day he could treat me like that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "the first love is innocent, he has my first everything (we eventually had sex and it was my first time) and he was very comforting to be around. it literally felt like my entire body would slow down with him. had a hard childhood with strict parents, and i felt so safe and warm under his arm. he graduated and we still text and im finding it difficult to stop talking to him, he calls me daily. i respond. also to find the strength not to be depressed, not to care what he’s doing, and not to let this ruin me like it’s been doing. i feel dead inside. it’s over and im holding onto nothing but i can’t let go. i cannot do it and i seriously feel like i will spiral into *serious* depression if i do. help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also- i’ve always been very independent, top of my class kind of girl, etc. but now i feel like i NEED him. (i can’t even if i wanted to. he’s graduated. remember this is college not high school, we don’t live in the same town this happened over the course of a year at school) \n",

      "Body text: I (17F) have been with my long distance boyfriend (17M) for just over 9 months now and I feel like my overthinking and mental health are starting to take over the relationship. I have always been the kind of person to overthink and worry due to past relationship issues and the ways I have been treated in the past. However, over these past couple months I have noticed that my mental state and worrying has played a huge part on what is happening during our time together. I have recently been catching him out on little things such as a girl messaging, and flirting with him but there was no messages back, or deleted ones, and also today I found out that he had messaged my ex best friend (16F) behind my back as we have had a huge argument and fell out. But I’ve never overthought as much as I have been recently. I feel as though my thoughts are becoming too much for him as he is now very easily irritable and also getting really annoyed when I ask him anything about him hating me, or him getting bored of me. I understand some can find this annoying, but he has never been like this before, I feel as though it is somewhat tearing us apart. (I have been receiving help for my personal mental issues)\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my partner for almost 7 years. We have a young son together. And I feel like I’m stuck in a situation where every possible path forward comes at a cost - either to the people I love, or to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, we had sex multiple times a day. It was passionate and connected. My libido has always been high. This isn’t something new or out of the blue. I’ve always been upfront about my needs for physical and emotional closeness. Before this relationship, I even dated in the swinging community. I’ve never hidden this side of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But about four years ago, her libido disappeared. It’s not that she doesn’t want sex with me. She’s said she doesn’t want it at all. She doesn’t feel sexual desire anymore, even solo. She’s also withdrawn from physical affection more broadly. She doesn’t like kissing on the lips or being touched in intimate ways. That’s her boundary, and I want to respect that. She deserves to feel safe, not pressured.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I miss that connection. I miss being kissed. Touched. Desired. Not just sexually, but emotionally too. I want to feel wanted, held, close to someone. I want to feel like I matter in that way.\n",

      "When I try to bring it up, it’s uncomfortable for both of us.

I have a high libido and deep emotional need for closeness. I don’t want to pressure her, cheat, or leave and repeat the trauma of my father abandoning our family. But I don’t want to lose myself either. I’ve tried finding support, but couples counselling that’s neurodiverse-affirming feels almost impossible to access. What now?\n",

I sleep peacefully worrying about nothing and wake up happily to a new day … so for nearly 15 years I guess, right from when is was in 4th grade .. my dad became alcoholic and he used to come home very very late like 2am or 3am in the morning in drunk state talking in a very abusive way to my mom and talking same shit past story for 3-4 hours and not letting anyone sleep until he sleeps .. this is continously happening till date and it includes occasionally beating my mum .. I have been facing this since my childhood and I used to feel embarrassed because of him in public places , family gatherings and also my school as he would talk like a shit to my friends ..\n",

As an elder one and the one with so much love for my mum .. I stood up against him .. stayed awake until he slept and protected my mom … during these mess . Sometimes it used to get soo bad that we had to call neighbour uncles for help as we all are women and couldn’t handle him . He does this for a week and then next week he becomes alright and again the same pattern continues till date .. whenever I was in my home country I used to not sleep peacefully everyday getting scared how he would come.. also there is not even a single family function where I wasn’t scared feeling he would embarrass us .\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I used to confront him he used to talk back and suddenly become extremely mad and try to hit me and my mom used to save me .. there are many days till now where I have prayed to god that he dies and never comes back or I have a nice dad like my friends .. his side of family is total shit back of money and that hurts him clearly .. on the other hand my moms side of family is very helpful and very close knit .. I’m not sure if this is bothering this fucker.. he keeps messing each and every family function in my moms side or every function or special occasion like birthday or wedding day by coming home late like an asshole and making an issue ..\n",

      "Throughout our friendship, he voiced that he liked me but I didn’t really see him as anything more than a friend. Idk the physical attraction wasn’t really there- I didn’t get butterflies and jitters and the thought of maybe dating him wasn’t all that appealing. He said he was fine being just friends. That was over a year ago and I thought we were good, but I could feel that by the beginning of this year that he really didn’t want to just be friends. I, of course, ignored those signs hoping that I was just wrong and reading into something that wasn’t there. \n",

      "Body text: Okay so for context we've been dating for about  half a year and everything has gone smoothly expect for this aspect of our life. Sexual things are very touchy for me as if since I have trauma from it, and already get easily triggered. Thankfully I'm able to tell him when I dont want to, and we usually do it 2-3 times a week. But early into the months I've noticed he's starting not to want to reciprocate anything. I dont mean like he doesnt want to do a certain action - I mean he just doesnt want to touch me back at ALL. We dont do penetration since neither of us enjoy it, but other than that he wants me to go round after round with pleasuring him. If I make any hint that I want something back or at least  want something done together (without being pushy), he gets weird about it and just asks me to please him again. It makes me feel objectified. I've brought this up to him another time and he said he feels bad. I thought maybe its a sexual preference so I asked him \"okay, can you just me more romantic with me then\" (kissing me more, telling me he loves me lots, reassuring me, etc). he said he would but he never does. He says he promises we'll spend time together without intimacy soon but we never do. It's getting to the point where I dont even want to do it with him anymore; if its not me getting triggered by the act itself, its me getting triggered by him not even seeming to care about me during it. I need help on how to get through to him, because he seems not to be understanding how this make me feel.\n",

      "Body text: Hello reddit, this is a very weird situation so I’ll try to tell it as simply as possible:\n",
      "Note: english is not my first language, so sorry for all the errors and mistakes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: I 20F and my boyfriend 20M have been dating for four years now, and living together for 1,5 years. I’ve had quite a share of trauma in life, which led to me starting therapy when I was about 15 years old, and I still go weekly to this day. I am autistic and have had an OCD diagnosis for a few years, but it’s medicated and quite well controlled nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend however was raised by a therapist mom and a nonchalant father, which made his whole childhood and teenage years to be full of questions after questions after questions about his feelings. The thing is, his mom never did the questioning thing correctly, so every time my boyfriend would show any type of emotion ever, she would bombard him with questions like ”Are you anxious? Are you suicidal? Are you feeling mad at me?” Like in EVERY situation possible. So many times when she would ask him to even do a simple chore and he would say ”I’ll do it in a second” or something, she never just let it be and had to question his every feeling and motivation for anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "This worked maybe when he was younger and learning to identify his emotions, but when he became a teenager and maybe didn’t want to tell everything to his parents, he just learnt to shut the emotions down, bottle them up and then burst them out in anger at some point. \n",
      "Because of this he doesn’t want to show nearly any emotion with his parents, and even loving gestures, touches or words aren’t okay to show from me when we are with his parents. When we are with my parents, we both show eachother normal love like we would do at home or anywhere really, so it’s not just that he doesn’t want others to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, he had a mental health crisis when he was about seventeen, and I helped him along with his parents getting him some therapy, but only for a few months. I don’t know what he talked about with the therapist, but I feel like it was not a right fit for him, as he just stopped going and said he didn’t need it anymore.\n",
      "\n",

It was so fun and I felt so lucky, but I also learned that my 'best friend' was asked to help plan and basically she was being rude, short and didn't participate in the party planning. She also didn't show up which I was hurt by. we had gone out earlier in the week to celebrate my birthday, so it's not like she forgot, but I thought it was so mean of her to a. be rude to my family and b. bail on the planning and not show up at all.

      "Body text: I'm running into a slight etiquette issue with a friend of ours! As a friend group of 5+ years, we love watching movies, shows, etc. and talking about them - and who doesn't? Generally, we have a really good time. However, one of our friends (27M) is a little *less* great at having these discussions. He'll pretty frequently come to a gathering or our group chat with a very strong, somewhat poorly thought-out opinion - think \"*the whole message of* All Quiet on the Western Front *was that war is hard, but worth it*.\" (Not a real example, but very *very* close to one.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I know you can only trust my word on this, but our group is really civil - we never go \"what?!\" or berate him or anything. We engage with what he says seriously, even when we have to be honest and tell him we really disagree. These discussions often lead to a lot of backpedaling and shifting goalposts whenever we try to point out that a claim of his doesn't hold a lot of water - while he doesn't get angry or defensive, and he *does* admit he's in the wrong, it seems to take him a *lot* longer (think hours or days) to get there, and we end up beating dead horses for a long time whenever he's included in a media-related discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has become *really* un-fun for most of us in the group - we love talking about media together, and we enjoy lively debates, but it's gotten frustrating over the years to have fun conversations get actively derailed by having to explain very basic media literacy/criticism things to this friend. The kicker to all of this: he *loves* these discussions. He's said to us multiple times things like, \"I really missed being on the debate team in high school - this is really fun, you guys!\" and really feels that our conversations have been mutually enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this friend, and I'm *very* glad he's getting a lot out of our conversations - but I'm struggling to know how to approach the growing annoyance. It feels incredibly rude and/or pointed to just say, \"Actually, I didn't have a lot of fun. I felt like we were all defending a relatively obvious thing to you, and you keep backpedaling when we show you reasons why you're wrong,\" but most of our group really does feel that way. Does anyone have any tips for being gracious while engaging with someone who's just not the greatest at these conversations? I absolutely don't want him to feel discounted or upset, but I worry resentment will start growing if we can't talk about how difficult it often is to \"debate\" with him.\n",

      "Body text: I expressed I felt that it felt impersonal because it feels like it is a routine, and especially when he needs to finish it has to in a *very* specific position, down to every detail of even having his head over my left shoulder his head buried in the pillow. When I tried to have him switch his head over the other shoulder he couldn’t get back into it. When we had an open conversation, I asked why he felt it had to end this way. He responded with “I just have to get into the right head space, where I feel safe, I’m with my person and I don’t have any distractions”, while I don’t want him to feel anything less then safe and feel like he is with his person, it does feel very disconnecting that he can’t look at me and almost have a moment all about him rather then it connecting us closer. Asking a little further, seems like this has been consistent, as in he had to be in this position to get to his end to, further drove the point that this is not about connecting together through sex just simply needing to block out distractions “like your boobs”, to be able to get in the right headspace to cum. I just want to gain some other people’s perspective, advice or things we can try to help both of us. He wants to try but when we tried to have sex again without going into that position he wasn’t able to cum because he’s too in his head which I understand because of the situation above, but I just want to help this situation move forward because if we continue this I just feel like I’m the same routine he followed with his past partners and I’m more like a quick means to an end\n",

      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",

      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",

      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

      "Body text: TLDR: Should my girlfriend be invited to UFC nights even tho it has previously always been a night for the guys and most of the people there are single guys?\n",
      "\n",
      "This may sound childish but my gf is really angry and I don’t know if she is being childish or if perhaps I am. My girl has recently been begging to be invited to hangouts with my friends and begging me to go to hers, I’ve been hosting UFC nights for all my boys for the past few years now, every time there is a ufc card fight night or ppv we are chillin in my basement. Most of the guys are single, but me and one other guy have gfs. Now my girl has recently been telling me that she thinks its important she gets to know my friends better and that she deserves to be invited to whatever I am doing with my friends once in a while. For the most part I agree and I told her that we will organize some double dates or some other activities where the girls will be invited. She was not happy and for some reason just wouldn’t let up. So last saturday I caved and she came to ufc night at mine. My other friends girl was busy that night, so she was the only girl there. other than greetings and small talk nobody really talked to her and she mostly just stuck to me. Fast forward 2 days and my friend told his girl that everyone found it awkward that she was there, and felt like they couIdn’t really act like themselves. I am sure that nobody said that, and he is just telling that to his girl so that she doesn’t want to come in the future. I know it sounds fucked but that guy is fucked in the way he treats/manipulates his girl. However now his girl told my girl and she really isnt happy. She thinks its extremely mean on my friends part to have even said that, and when i told her that nobody said that she just tells me that they obviously wouldnt tell me and that im wrong and they really all felt awkward because of her. Now shes saying she never wants to come again and she is really not happy. Personally i never wanted it to be like this but that is honestly exactly what I pictured happening and I really dont see why we can’t just have boys nights once in a while. Im trying to explain to her that since most of my friends are single, nobody wants to be THAT guy bringing his girl to the function and now suddenly nobody can be themselves anymore and its awkward… My friends don’t really know my girl like that so i can understand why her being there made it awkward for them. We have been dating for almost 4 years now and UFC has always just been for the boys. Am I wrong for wanting to have some nights that are just for the guys every once in a while?\n",

      "Title: Girlfriend wants to take a break after I triggered a traumatic memory\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "My (21M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been together for a while, and I really do love her. We’ve had some amazing moments and a strong emotional connection, but we’ve also faced some ongoing challenges that I think are now coming to a head.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a history of trauma — specifically an incident in college where a guy invited her over under the impression they were just going to watch a movie. Instead, he took advantage of her. Cops got involved, but nothing came of it because there wasn’t enough evidence. Since then, she’s understandably had trust and boundary issues. Whenever I’ve tried to talk about it — gently and only when it felt appropriate — she’s always avoided the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also tends to struggle with communication and emotional vulnerability. I know confrontation is difficult for her. When she’s overwhelmed, her go-to is to shut down, go quiet, or pull away. I’ve always tried to be supportive, but this avoidance has made resolving conflict really difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to a few nights ago: she had a headache, and I offered to give her a head massage. She declined and said she’d take ibuprofen instead. I kept insisting — not realizing how much I was pushing her past a boundary. She eventually said “this is getting weird” and went to the bathroom. I didn’t realize at the time, but I had unintentionally triggered a traumatic memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she texted saying she needed space. When I asked if I had done something wrong, she explained that I reminded her of the guy who hurt her — that when I kept pushing past her “no,” it brought her back to that experience. She said she wasn’t directly comparing me to him, but it gave her flashbacks and made her cry in the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt terrible. I texted her that I wanted to talk and really understand, and told her I respect her boundaries and want to make things right. I acknowledged my mistake and said I’d listen more carefully moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening she texted me “hi” — I left it on read, trying to give space. Later that night, she messaged again: “I wanna go on a break.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That hit hard. I’ve been through something like this before, where a past ex asked for a break and then just slowly faded away, leading to a breakup that hurt a lot more because it was dragged out with no closure. So I emotionally replied: “Are you being serious?” And then a follow up message, “If you’re gonna leave me then tell me already, I don’t wanna go through this again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: “I just don’t know what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took an hour and then sent a message saying that I still love her and want to work things out — but if she doesn’t want to be with me anymore, she should be honest. I acknowledged that we’ve both made mistakes, that I’ve done things wrong, and that a serious relationship requires communication, patience, and growth. I also told her that I respect her enough to try, but it feels like she might not respect me enough to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "No response since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve drafted another message since, trying to express that if she truly wants to work things out, we need to talk within the relationship, not take breaks every time things get hard. I even said that if this keeps being the pattern — avoiding problems, emotionally shutting down, leaving me in the dark — then maybe we’re not actually ready for the long-term relationship we said we wanted. But I haven’t sent it. I don’t want to make things worse or chase after someone who isn’t sure they want to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some more context about her:\n",
      "\t•\tShe struggles with emotional processing and often says she needs “space” instead of directly addressing issues. She’s had a past of horrible exes from HS and her first year of college. One cheated on her, another is overly obsessive and manipulative and finds ways to text her despite being blocked on multiple occasions. Another guy was dating her and thought they were in a relationship.\n",
      "\t•\tThis isn’t the first time she’s pulled away when we’ve had a conflict, though this is by far the most serious.\n",
      "\t•\tShe’s avoided other tough conversations in the past — like talking about her trauma, or times she’s felt disconnected — and I’ve always tried to be patient with that.\n",
      "\t•\tThat said, sometimes I feel like I’m doing all the emotional work, and that she leans on avoidance while I’m stuck waiting and wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love her. I still want this to work. But I’m exhausted from the emotional uncertainty and the feeling that I’m more committed to solving problems than she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my questions are:\n",
      "\t•\tShould I give her the space she says she needs and wait to see if she reaches back out?\n",
      "\t•\tShould I send my follow-up message, even if it risks pushing her further away?\n",
      "\t•\tOr should I take this as a sign that we’re just not compatible anymore — that we’re not ready for the kind of relationship we both said we wanted?\n",
      "\n",
      "Any insight would help. I don’t want to make a decision out of fear or hurt, but I also don’t want to keep chasing someone who’s already emotionally walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I (21M) accidentally triggered my girlfriend’s (21F) past trauma by pushing to give her a head massage after she said no. She later said she needed space, then asked for a break. I told her I still love her and want to work things out, but only if we do it within the relationship — not by avoiding problems. She hasn’t responded. I’m torn between giving her space, sending a follow-up message, or accepting that we may not be compatible. Not sure what to do.\n",

      "Body text: Hi Reddit,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend (we’re both 19 now and about 160cm tall). I’ve loved her deeply all this time, and I still do. But I’m at a point where I’m feeling conflicted, frustrated, and unsure how to handle things.\n",
      "When we started dating, she weighed around 58kg (~128lbs), and I was totally fine with that. I’ve never been someone obsessed with looks. But over the years, she’s gained a lot of weight — now she’s about 86kg (~190lbs). I’m not trying to fat-shame her, and I understand that bodies change, but this is starting to affect her health. She’s experiencing knee pain and struggles with things like getting up or moving around easily.\n",
      "She’s been doing what looks like intense workouts (4 times a week) for about 1 year, and from what I can tell, she’s really trying. But despite that, she keeps gaining weight. Every time I try to bring it up — gently, I swear — she gets really upset. Last time, I mentioned that maybe she could try eating just a little less, and she broke down crying and called me an asshole. She said I could never understand what it's like because I’m naturally thin (I weigh 45kg and actually struggle with gaining weight myself).\n",
      "She’s seeing a nutritionist, and she says she’s eating normally and not starving herself. But to be honest, I don’t know how to make sense of it — because if she were truly burning more calories than she consumes, she shouldn’t be gaining weight, right? I’ve tried to explain this without sounding cruel, but it always ends with her in tears or calling me an idiot who just doesn’t understand.\n",
      "So here’s the truth: I feel guilty because I still love her, but I’m also less and less physically attracted to her. Sometimes when I see her undress, I feel kind of grossed out, and that makes me feel like a horrible person. We still have regular sex, and it hasn’t affected that part of our relationship — yet. But I’m worried that over time, this lack of attraction will become a bigger issue.\n",

      "Title: BF (25 M) said I ruined his birthday, I tried. What do I do?\n",
      "Body text: Yesterday was my (25F) bfs (26M) birthday. We’ve been dating nearly 4 years now. I put in good effort for the occasion- I got him three gifts that totaled about $325 and all correlated to his most current hobbies (a cool monster hunter figure imported from japan, merch from his favorite sports team, a glass guitar slide). I baked a cake from scratch, probably the best thing I’ve ever made ngl. I made dinner reservations at a nice place. I just wanted to do it right and make him feel special.\n",
      "\n",
      "He loved the gifts, and we spent the morning having coffee and cake. He told me later he liked the cake so much that it was literally all he ate that day before dinner. We both had work that day, and I had a pretty busy day. I admit I was a little stressed when I got home, but I was excited for dinner and we both got ready and headed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like dinner was where I messed up. It started out fine, and our meals were delicious and we were chatting abt random stuff. But at some point I just kept saying the wrong thing, ig. We were talking about tattoos we wanted, and I accidentally brought up an old incident where he left a family reunion with his siblings to get tats, which ended up taking 8 hours and left me babysitting a bunch of random children alone. He seemed upset, I realized my mistake, and I quickly changed topics. But he clearly was still upset. As soon as we left he wouldn’t talk to me in the car or at home, and all he wanted to do was lay in bed silently scrolling his phone. He didn’t want to be touched either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning he said he was miserable for the entirety of his birthday. That kinda hurt. He seemed happy the previous morning and we had a great convo over coffee. He told me he had an awful day at work, and my irritability when I got home was not okay (I made two comments about food in the sink and the cat peeing on the floor, but I guess I didn’t balance it out with something positive). He said he wasn’t happy with our dinner conversation, and all he wanted on his birthday was to be happy, so I ruined it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I could have done better, but I find it difficult to be the perfect conversationalist. I’m so much better at the gestures, so it always sucks when saying dumb shit ruins it. Most of the birthday posts I’ve seen are the opposite- no effort, forgot, etc. \n",

      "Body text: My bf has a younger sister who, I'll be honest, I'm not very fond of. I think you may understand why after reading the entire post.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is still in college. She kept telling her parents and my bf its because she does sports and had to push back her exams, which sounded pretty sus to me but her family accepted the story and I didn't want to cross any boundaries. Her parents fund her degree and they have been taking her word at face value and paying her tuition all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she had approached her parents and my bf and started bawling. Turns out, she has actually been failing her first year for 7 years straight and hasn't paid her tuition for three years and her college is now threatening to throw her out after years of multiple warnings. When my bf asked where all the money went, she said she used it to travel. She goes to Bali twice a year, lives a very luxurious and expensive lifestyle (she's an aspiring influencer) and lied to her family saying it was from her own money. Turns out, she didn't have a job or any money and just blew her tuition fee on expensive things.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has then asked her parents to give her an allowance (because she's broke and \"couldn't keep living like this\") and for them to pay off all her college arrears. She had then threatened to hurt herself if they didn't do this.\n",

His sister always expects him to pitch in fix her fuck ups. She totaled her car driving drunk twice, and she demanded that he fix it for her both times. And he just...did it. She makes him by her designer stuff he cant afford...and again....he just does it. She is a very entitled and self centered person and my bf and his family enables her behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brushed this off for 3 years now. I always believed it was not my place to comment on their relationship. Their family and I need to know my place. And honestly, my bf is the sweetest, kindest and most loving guy I've met. I value him and cherish him a lot. But the fact that this keeps happening regularly is worrying me. I feel like he doesn't know how to draw boundaries with her and one day, if we get married, he will bankrupt the two of us and our family trying to help her. I initially thought this may be an overreaction but the more and more I see this happening, the more I believe that it is completely possible. I have tried bringing this up with him but he is very protective of his sister and the conversations haven't really gone anywhere.\n",

      "Title: My bf [25M] refuses to marry me [22F] until we’re in our 50’s. I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend now for little over a year. But we ‘dated’ for about a year before becoming official. As the years have passed obviously conversations have popped up such as: what are both our thoughts on having children? when might be the appropriate length of time to move in together? And finally: marriage. We are both in this relationship for the long run, neither of us have ever dated casually and were only looking for long term relationships when we met. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6 months ago, the topic of marriage got brought up for the first time. Not because either of us want to get married now, but because I hope to one day get married in the future (next 10 years). My bf responded by saying something along the lines of: “only when I’m in my 50’s or later”, I thought he was joking, I really believed he was pulling my leg, until he made it really clear that he was being deadly serious. I was a little upset, but I wanted to understand why. His reasoning for doing so was because: he didn’t want to conform to “societies norms”, he said too many people “play by the book” and he believes people should break that, that our love shouldn’t be defined by a legally binding contract and that after people marry it all goes down hill from there. I explained that I didn’t view marriage that way, that I viewed marriage as two people making eternal promises to one another and that making vows and sharing a day where we can celebrate our relationship is very important to me (and of course ever since I was a little girl I’ve always fantasised about the dress and the ring). He replied with “if it’s a day you want I’ll throw you a party, I’ll get you a ring so you can tell people we’re married, but I’m not getting married until late”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this conversation we have had the same discussion about 5 times over the last 6 months. I always end up burying my head in the sand and hoping that by the next time he has changed his opinion, even if it’s only a little. But nothing has changed and he is very set on his opinion. I’ve even spoken to my mother and stepfather about it, who themselves didn’t marry until they were both 55, and they say it’s “just an age thing, he’ll grow out of it in the next 5 years”. But I don’t know if I can see that happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he’s being so so stubborn about it being so late in life. He still says he wants to marry, just not until then. Other information I do feel is important to add is that his parents are divorced (so are mine), and divorced when he was 17, from what I know it was quite a turbulent split and his mother claims she left it later than she should’ve. Other than that our relationship is strong, arguments are rare and I’m very close with his family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do love him very dearly, and I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but this is something I’ve always wanted to fulfil in my life and something I believe is a very important aspect of a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of staying with him for the rest of my life and never getting married has crossed my mind, I don’t want to be bitter or resentful in 30 years time because he deprived me of being able to marry while I get to watch all of my friends and family get married. But the thought of leaving him to find someone who can give me these things and living without him is just as bitter. \n",

      "EDIT: wow… I don’t know how many people will see this update but I’m overwhelmed by how many people have commented. Pretty much all the same thing, some just a little more hurtful than the others, some really motivating. Overall after reading all the comments I feel small, like really small… and stupid. I don’t know how I’ll be able to reply without getting really upset so I guess this is my reply. I feel incredibly insecure and honestly too embarrassed to reply to a lot of the comments here. So to those who do just want the best outcome for me I really appreciate your heartfelt advice and time. Thanks to everyone for your input, I never expected to get so many comments. \n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \\[33F\\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n",

      "Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for.

      "Body text: UPDATE: A conversation last night pretty much confirmed my suspicion that he's planning to force a move when his mom visits next month. He has asked me to empty our storage unit before she arrives \"to prove to her that we are okay\" which makes zero sense. Then he dropped \"if we didn't have all the extra stuff we could just pack up and go try living with her and see what it's like.\"\n",

      "It's my understanding that I can't get a court order to prevent him from taking the kids out of state and I'd only be able to file an emergency order to return them after they were taken if he attempted to establish residence with them elsewhere. It's either that or file for divorce and add a provision that he not be able to leave the state with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I texted MIL telling her clearly that we do NOT want to live with her and that I just want to be on the same page so she isn't prepping her house and getting her hopes up for no reason. She stopped talking to both my husband and I. She's been pretty communicative but no contact with either Of us all day which is weird since lately it's been daily. A lot of weird things are suddenly making sense, like her insisting she would take my kids when she visits so we can have a day alone, which would never happen because they don't even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am alerting the rest of their family in her area that she is doing this so if they do try to take the kids the rest of the family can be on the lookout for them and let me know where they are. I am close with his dad and stepmom who I haven't said anything to about this up to this point.\n",
      "\n",

      "MIL was no/minimal contact for years and very suddenly after loss of the last family she had is pressuring us to move in with her with our two kids 1800 miles away from everything they have ever known. My husband wants to go and I do not. It’s ruining our relationship. What rights do I have if I do not want to move my family across the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief history. MIL and I had a good relationship until we moved out of state after 6 years. She cut contact with my Husband for many months and it took years for them to establish a relationship again. During that time we got married, had a baby, and she still refused contact with me because I \"took her baby\" from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was 4 years ago. She lost her brother a few months ago and he was the last of her family. She doesn't have familial relationships with anyone except a very distant relationship with her brother's 2 kids. This is by her doing. She has largely cut her other son out of her life because she doesn't like his new girlfriend and feels she is taking him from her (sounds familiar). So suddenly she is reaching very intensely out of the blue to establish a relationship with me and my daughter who she has had no contact with her entire life. Never sent a gift or a card or called to talk to her (she's 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she is saying she wants us to come live with her. We are 1800 miles apart. She wants us to live with her until we find work and a home near her. To me, it feels like she's grasping at the last shred of family she has left realizing that she has no one else. She is enchanting my husband with how magical this will be. She will babysit, buy all our food, cook for us, give us date nights whenever we want, we can live in her 10 acres and have lots of space for our two kids and our dogs. It all sounds great except.. we live here. Our jobs are here. Our life and all our kids have ever known is here. There is no reason to leave other than her suddenly deciding this is what needs to happen. She literally went from not talking to me for 4 years to texting me \"I love you\" every day and telling me how she's getting her house ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing a HUGE problem between my husband and I because he LOVES this idea but before this we were happy living where we are. We have goals and plans that are based here. One of our kids is in school here, I'm in college here, we have a good program here that allows anyone to get a free degree up to a bachelors. I can finish school without owing any money. There are many reasons I want to stay where we are. The same reasons we chose to live here in the first place. But now my husband is caving under this delusion of a beautiful carefree life with his mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to resolve this. I'm not moving my family across the country on a whim just because my MIL decided she's lonely and he's set that it would be great for our family. She is set to visit for the first time next month after saying for YEARS she would NEVER come here and previously said she would come up to help us move everything in with her. I kind of feel like they are planning to twist my arm when she is here and try to force moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I protect myself from this and also keep a good relationship with my husband? I don't even know what my legal rights are if he were to say we're moving and I don't want to.\n",

      "[My (46F) BF’s (49M) friend (47F) doesn’t want me around : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kkvbca/my_46f_bfs_49m_friend_47f_doesnt_want_me_around/)\n",
      "\n",
      "TL; DR - My (46F) BF (49M) has a decades-long friendship with a woman friend (47F) who has been unpleasant towards me and who isn't interested in getting to know me. They went out to dinner alone, and I didn't like what he reported back about how it went. We discussed how to handle it; I wasn't comfortable with the resolution until yesterday when we clarified some things. It turns out he had already taken many steps to distance himself from her and is fully committed to making sure all of his friends treat me respectfully.\n",

      "\\_\\_\\_\\_\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I had a long chat with BF yesterday. I am feeling fine now. I had made some incorrect assumptions and misunderstood a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1 - He had already resolved to refuse any one-on-one invites from her. At the end of our last discussion, he'd said he wasn't sure what he would say to her. I thought that meant he wasn't sure if he would turn her down or not. He actually just meant he wasn't sure how he would phrase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 - I assumed they were in closer touch over text than is true. After the dinner last year, I told him that I'd prefer him not to go out with her alone but that I didn't expect him to completely end the friendship and that remaining in contact was fine as long as it was appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he had not initiated a single text to her since their dinner last year after I expressed concern. She has texted him maybe 5 times in the past year, all very benign and appropriate, like \"Happy birthday\" or \"I heard your uncle passed away; condolences.\" He responded to each with polite but very short messages \"Thank you. Hope you're well.\" No phone calls or other forms of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that they'd been slightly drifting apart before we met anyway, so he decided to steer things in the direction of drifting even further out of contact since it was creating an issue for us. He was prepared to be more confrontational if she got inappropriate again but was happy to find that it wasn't necessary. As mentioned in the original post, they have many many overlapping friend and family links so it would be preferable not to have a dramatic rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - I assumed they were bumping into each other at group events with some frequency. It turns out she hasn't been able to attend any of the same events that he has. The last time they actually saw each other was in fact that dinner last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that I was avoiding asking for details about how often they were in contact as a way to cope with my discomfort without being too controlling. I can be a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\" so I was doing well in not letting it bother me until I saw her name pop up in a recent text, right after one of those events that I'd assumed he'd seen her at. We decided that going forward, he will proactively tell me anytime he has even incidental contact with her so that I can assume nothing is happening if I don't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a long discussion about respect in general. He is totally willing to drop any friends who are disrespectful to me or our relationship. We also discussed what appropriate behaviors look like; I think he has a much better awareness now. I asked him to think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was out alone with a male friend, and he was a fly on the wall, would be happy to hear us discussing sex or hear the other guy make even borderline disparaging remarks about him? He admitted that he would not, and he will adhere to the same standard going forward with any female friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he said he's willing to refuse any other one-on-one invitations from women who don't want to include me and to drop the friendship if they are pushy about it. Luckily this isn't likely to be a big issue, as I have met and really like most of his female friends, and the ones who live far away and haven't visited yet have already said that they're eager to meet me as soon as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I currently feel a little silly for having worked myself up so much over a woman that he's seen once and exchanged about 20 words of text with in the past 18 months. But relieved that it's resolved. And I learned that the \"out of site out of mind\" tactic is not a good long-term fix for me; if something is bugging me, I need to go ahead and ask about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have approached him about it before as I have childhood trauma from alcohol abuse and it’s also just something that is not attractive. We have that conversation twice. He got sober for about 2 weeks and then went back into drinking. I justified it as it’s not hard alcohol, but I told him he can’t just have one drink. He realized it and did better, but it just never stuck. Now, it’s the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned this and I haven’t been able to separate from him since he wasn’t in the states cause he went on a family vacation. \n",

      "Fast forward- I met his family and his parents thanked me that I helped him cool down on the alcohol. How are they see the love he has and the work he is putting in.

So that next day, he was SEVERELY hungover to where he was shaking, cold shivers, feeling nauseous, etc. at that point, I didn’t feel an ounce of emotion as I was already fed up. Decided I’ll talk to him once we get back to the states. Mind you, not admitting he drank heavily by himself all day. \n",

      "I’m just here to vent. To remind myself that I’m doing the right thing. To express I have so much love for him, he does anything and everything for me without a second guess.. I’m just hurt trying to compartmentalize it all. I feel like the bad guy for doing this for myself. I want him to better himself but this was an issue I’ve dealt with him 2 months in.

      "\n",
      "My (29F) boyfriend (28M) often makes snide remarks about how my family supports me financially, and calls me privileged for it. We've been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an only child, my family isn't rich but we share what we have with each other. Before my current boyfriend, I was with an ex that painted himself as a good guy up until I moved across the country with him and he isolated me, abused me, stole all my money, and knocked me up. I have a 2 year old daughter with him, but I was able to escape the situation when I was 5 months pregnant. My parents bought my plane ticket home and welcomed me with open arms. They assumed full financial responsibility for my child and I so that I could be a stay at home mom on top of healing from the trauma and going back to college to finish up my degrees and work when I'm ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend comes from an affluent family; however, his father passed away 2 years ago, and he was the sole breadwinner for the family. It turned his family's life upside down, his mother is now living off of money lent from other family members and social security as she's in her 70s and can't work. He works under the table at a place that doesn't pay hourly, it's based on commissions. He's there for 10+ hours some days but if there's no customers, he doesn't get paid a penny. On a good day, he'll make about $70, but that's so disproportionate to what he should be making for that amount of time worked (we're in CA). He's really angry about not having much money, but also refuses to look for another job out of loyalty to his boss who's also his friend. He's always upset about being late on payments as well as his mom asking him for money. I feel bad for him and I try to be as understanding as I can, I know he's under a lot of stress financially, and I never ask him for anything or expect anything from him. Just his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he's been making more and more jabs at me about being \"Miss Privileged\" for taking handouts from my parents and not having to work while he works 5 days a week and is still struggling to make ends meet. All my parents help me with is my $25 a month phone bill and food and clothes from the thrift store for my daughter. I left everything I had when I left my ex and came home to my parents and live minimalistically, but my boyfriend had many payments he's responsible for (car, phone, credit card, student loans, helping his mom, etc). I'm trying to be empathetic towards him and I know he has it much harder than me, but there's nothing I can do about it and I don't think I should be ashamed for having a family that takes care of me when I'm down.\n",

      "TLDR; My boyfriend is a great partner in practical ways (helpful, supportive, kind in actions) but struggles with emotional reassurance. He rarely gives verbal/physical affection, shuts down when I’m upset, and gets frustrated when I ask if he’s mad (he has a neutral face that looks angry). I have anxious tendencies and crave more emotional connection, which he feels is too much. He thinks my anxiety is the main problem, but I’m wondering if we’re just emotionally incompatible. Sometimes I feel like he hates me but I think that's all in my head. I'm not sure what to do\n",

      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, living together for 3 months. He’s genuinely a good partner in many ways. He helps around the house, supports us financially, remembers little details about me, and is always down to do activities I suggest. He’s not controlling, doesn’t mind when I go out with friends/family, and shows his care through actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But emotionally, I struggle. He doesn’t express affection verbally much (rarely says “I love you” or compliments), and when I’m upset or crying, he tends to shut down. He says he doesn’t want to say “I love you” too often ot compliments me because it loses its value. Or feels like I'll just keep asking for more if he gives me what I need. So he'd rather leave it as is so I don't end up asking him to say those words more frequently.\n",

      "He’s not big on physical comfort either, especially when he’s annoyed. When I ask him for reassurance like a hug or kind words, he usually doesn’t respond or changes the subject.\n",

      "He also has a very neutral resting face that looks pissed off to me, which triggers my anxiety. I tend to ask, “Are you mad?” or “Is something wrong?” often. He says he’s fine, but then gets frustrated that I keep asking. He feels like I’m accusing him of being mad when he’s not, and it leads to tension. This has happened enough times that he feels we’re having the same tiring conversation over and over. Sometimes I feel like he hates me with the way he reacts or talks to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, he even chose to sleep on the couch, saying maybe if he acts like he doesn’t care, I’ll realize what “not caring” actually looks like, because he feels my constant questioning implies he doesn’t care.\n",

      "He thinks my anxiety is the root cause of our issues and has suggested medication. I’m open to working on myself and I’ve told him I’m willing to go to therapy. But I also wonder if we’re just emotionally mismatched in terms of needs and expression.\n",

After two years he dropped out. He worked a p/t job in retail for just under half a year and then went back to construction for a year and a half. While working construction again he was reminded of how taxing it is on his body and how he can't stay in that field. He recently went for surgery and is still healing.

They were both said in a joking tone, not mean. He has said something like that to me one other time a few months ago and i immediately told him to never speak to me like that. He apologized and hasn’t since then. I think it was him being drunk and with his friends and wanting to impress them or whatever.

      "For context we had a rough patch at the start of our marriage because I was so insecure about his exes because he told me about them too much when we were dating, he told me they broke up because it was a mutual understanding because they did not love each other anymore, so I was paranoid because we had dated only a short while after they broke up and got married 6 months after fast-forward to now he confessed that he had lied to me about the reason why, it turns out he cheated on both his exes and his recent one with the one prior and then cheated on the recent one with someone he met on a business trip. I asked him why he didn't tell me he said it was because he knew I loathed cheaters and I wouldn't marry him if I knew he was one (My dad cheated on my mom, which my mom still doesn't know about and I don't have the heart to tell her). \n",

I don't really know whether to believe that that was it, but now I'm stuck because he took off to his friends house because he said he couldn't face me. I don't know what to do moving forward, I want to try to mend things but I don't know how we can manage if he keeps running away from me and I just end up feeling like I'm chasing after a dead end. I guess I'm insecure of being divorced because it's frowned upon where I grew up. Sorry this is long I guess I just need to vent because he won't come home and doesn't want to talk to me.

      "Title: I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context:\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n",
      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",
      "* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n",
      "* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n",
      "* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n",

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

      "Title: I (32M) need to figure out what to do about my almost sexless 6 years relationship with my girlfriend (26F).\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR: Basically, I have a relationship with a girl that I like a lot; we have a very satisfying romantic life, but sex is almost always a problem. I have to initiate every time, and even when it gets going (once per month or less) the experience we have is kinda passionless and very clunky, for lack of a better word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry in advance if there’s some kink with my English, it‘s not my native language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the deal, and it’s a thing that’s been driving me insane for years: I love my girlfriend with all my heart, and she loves me back the same way, but she’s not interested in having an active sexual life with me, and for sure she’s not capable or not willing to initiate any sexual intercourse with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not that we haven’t discussed the problem through the years: the conversation always started from me, and she’s always reluctant to talk about it (she’s not much for difficult psychological and emotional matters and she’s kinds shy). And through the years she gave many different reasons for her apparent disinterest in sex (or in sex with me). Most importantly, that she never was that interested in the thing in the first place (even though in the beginning she was the one pestering me because we weren’t having enough moments of physical intimacy), but also she talked about me not being 100% her type, e.g. she would like for me to have a more athletic, even muscular body, while I’m more of a chubby guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem is (and trust me, I’m not really bragging or anything here, I’m just trying to be as honest as possible) that I’m not at all an ugly dude: I’m very confident, I know how to fascinate a girl and I’ve had many occasions to be flirtatious with others -even unfaithful- but I’ve never been able to act upon them, because I’m just not that kind of person. God knows how hard it has been, with sexual satisfaction coming my way once a month or even less, and always under my solicitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not to say that our feelings for each other aren’t the real deal and that’s what makes me feel so bad about this. When everything clicks in it’s place the times we spend together are amazing. Also, she’s always managed to push me out of my comfort zone and to bring out the best part of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s just that… having basically no sexual life sometimes really hurts. I’m not at all an hyper-sexual guy, and in my mind it feels at times kinda base and petty to make such a big deal about sex, when everything else works well. But you know, what makes this even more aggravating is the fact that having to always initiate any moment of intimacy, and then seeing her mostly interested in having her needs satisfied, while being kinda not interested, or awkward and detached when it comes to my part of the deal… makes for a very miserable experience.\n",

      "As I grew older, I realized that this kind of behavior isn’t normal. I’ve tried talking to her about it, asking her to communicate with me if I ever upset her.

      "Body text: Thank you for reading if you’re here 🥲\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background: I’m 26F, living with my fiancé (28M) about an hour north of my mom. We recently bought a 3-bedroom house we’ve been remodeling ourselves. It’s still a work in progress—one room doesn’t even have drywall or flooring yet and is currently being used to store our tools and paint. Our bedroom is finished, but the guest room doesn’t even have a door yet (we still need to buy them) and is also doubling as a storage space. We live with our three cats. My little sister is 14F, and is about to graduate from 8th grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto my mom. She’s a pathological liar. It’s something I’ve tolerated for years because most of her lies are small and don’t cause major harm. But it still bothers everyone who knows her—she lies constantly, doubles down when questioned, and ends conversations instead of owning up to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, her lying became a serious issue. She was kicked out of the house where my sisters and I grew up, but she told everyone she had sold it voluntarily. She assured us she had somewhere to go. She didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I called her to check in during her “move,” she was panicked and said she needed help moving a U-Haul and her car. I rushed over after work and found the house in a terrible state—completely unprepared, dirty, and filled with trash bags. There was grime all over the floor, a fridge that looked like it hadn’t worked in years, and everything that couldn’t be moved alone was simply left behind: her bedroom set, my childhood room, my sister’s belongings—years of memories just abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She admitted she had nowhere to go. I did the only thing I could think of: I got her into one of the apartments owned by the company I worked for. I signed the lease myself, put it under my name, and paid the full deposit and rent out of pocket, knowing I wouldn’t see that money again. I even risked my job to get her off the street. She had just $40K coming in from the sale of the house but wouldn’t receive it for a few more days. She was in her car with my 12-year-old sister and their two dogs (a 5 lb chihuahua and a 200 lb mastiff), with nowhere to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister didn’t even know they were moving. When I picked her up, she was confused and asked if they were just going to check out a new place. My mom lied directly to her face and said they had just bought a new house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, my mom repaid me for the apartment, but she then moved into a rental house for $2,600/month—completely unaffordable. I begged her not to. I hated watching her spend what little money she had furnishing the entire place from scratch, but she ignored me. She bought everything new—beds, couches, TVs, pillows, blankets—all to replace the things she left behind. I hoped she could stabilize in 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to yesterday: I get a call from my mom. She has to be out of her rental by midnight. She claims she’s been paying rent but her landlord wasn’t paying the mortgage and the house is being reclaimed. She’s scrambling to move everything into a U-Haul. Once again, my sister knows nothing. My mom told my sister (WHILE SHE WAS MOVING HER SHIT INTO A UHAUL) that she would  leave the apartment unlocked so my sister and I could grab clothes for her dad’s house over the weekend. I ended up having to be the one to break the news: “Mom got kicked out. Everything is in a storage unit now.” My sister was devastated, unsure why my mom couldn’t be honest with her. My sister asked me if my mom had bothered to pack her bed. It makes me cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have the resources to help this time. I can’t house her, especially with the mastiff. We’re financially stretched thin from the remodel. My fiancé and I both work full-time and aren’t home during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister is heartbroken. She’s supposed to go on a weeklong school trip to DC on Tuesday. My mom promised to drive her and her friend to the school that day. Now we’re not even sure if her things were packed or left behind again. Had we known what was happening, we could’ve at least made sure she brought her essentials to her dad’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just at a complete loss. My mom lies so much I never know what’s real. I know the obvious answer is “don’t believe anything,” but how am I supposed to help someone like that? I have nothing left to give, but I hate watching my sister go through this. I’m heartbroken and disappointed beyond words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to be honest, refuses to take accountability, and seems to believe that if she ignores her problems long enough, a miracle will fix them. But no miracle comes. And now my little sister, once again, is the one suffering the consequences.\n",

      "Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 and a 1/3rd ish years. We are both in our 3rd year of college(dual enrollment in high school)and still living at home/not on our own. Recently, our topic of conversation has been constantly swayed to the fact that I told her I wanted to wait until we are a. Financially secure b. Out of college/living together and c. Fix some of our relationship issues before getting engaged/ married. She however, has said that she wanted to be engaged within the next few months. Things took a turn for the worse today, and she is now saying that my views don’t align with hers and that she doesn’t think she wants to continue a relationship with me. She is saying that I am unwilling to choose her and that our love is conditional. She is also saying that she doesn’t want to wait and that she doesn’t want to be together because I want to wait and that it’s not fair for her to have to wait because I want to wait. For a little context I did mention a little bit about possible engagement sites/ rings but I didn’t say definitively that it would happen. How do I approach/ have a conversation with her about this without it resulting in her turning me down or not hearing my side? (I apologize if I may have left any details out, this currently has me very anxious becuase I do love her and want a future with her, I just need more time to feel ready for this big of a commitment)\n",

There hasn’t been one person I’ve introduced him too that doesn’t love him (close friends, family, etc.) and I trust the people closest to me of their opinion but i got this text in the middle of the night which I’m positive is from a fake number “stay woke girl. He puts up a good act. I would go through his phone if I were you” and another one that said “don’t say no one warned you”.  I asked him about it and he was clear that it was nothing and to go through his phone if I needed/wanted too. It’s been dwelling on me trying to figure out who would text me this and why and how do they have my number. Whoever sent me these messages didn’t reply with any sort of answer on why I should be worried and just told me to be careful. \n",

      "A few nights ago, we went on a date and had a great time. The next day, I got a text from her asking who a particular girl was. She only gave me a first name, so I asked for the last name. When she replied, I explained it was someone I went to school with. I didn’t think much of it and just left it at that.\n",

      "This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Twice before, my girlfriend has confronted me about women I follow on Instagram. Before we got serious, I made it a point to clear out my following list—removing anyone I had dated, met through dating apps, or had any romantic history with. I only kept people I knew from high school, family friends, and similar connections. \n",

      "The first time, she went through the accounts of the women I followed, asking who they were, why I followed them, and whether I had liked their photos. The second time, she randomly brought up another girl I followed and asked me to unfollow her. I figured it wasn’t a big deal, so I did.\n",

      "Body text: I wouldn't know for sure if I should label my girlfriend (22F) as \"emotionally dependent,\" but I don’t have a better term, so I apologize. She’s a very jealous person, and her constant phrases like “I couldn’t live without you” have me genuinely worried. She’s gone through very difficult situations in her life, and I partly understand why she is the way she is. She has practically no close friends or anyone to lean on, and despite all my efforts to encourage her to see life and relationships differently, she stays stuck in the idea that she’ll never need anyone but me—and that I will never leave her.\n",

      "\n",
      "And the worst part is that I constantly feel guilty, because I know I reinforced many of her patterns of thinking and behavior. At the beginning of our relationship, I was the one who told her I could change for her, that I’d do anything for her, and that she’d never lack love from me. In reality, all of that was a lie—not out of cruelty, but because I didn’t know how to measure my words when I was with her. And now, I don’t act the same way I did in the first two months of our relationship.\n",

We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "I (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him.

      "Body text: My boyfriend(22M) and I(21F) have been dating for nine months. He often drinks alcohol gets too drunk and then takes it out on me non physically. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days ago, I hit my head on the pavement after taking a fall. This is right in the middle of finals, whereas I am supposed to be graduating this semester. I finally decide to go to the doctor today because I have a headache and my vision is a little blurry. I go to the school doctor, which then tells me to go to the ER because symptoms are worrisome. The school doctor doesn’t let me leave the building without somebody coming to get me. Obviously, I call my boyfriend who lives with me, to come and get me. The only problem with that is that he was blacked out drunk so I had to call my other friend. This friend gets my boyfriend in his car and takes us to the hospital. All three of us are waiting in the waiting room and my boyfriend leaves. Apparently he went in the parking lot and threw up a bunch. I’m waiting to get a CT scan and cannot deal with him. After I get my CT scan done and everything he gets back inside my other friend at this point has to leave, leaving me alone with my boyfriend. While we’re waiting, he starts getting aggressive calling me a beach, saying that this is a waste of his time, and generally just being rude to me. At this point I’m frustrated because he’s asking me the same questions over and over and my headache is not going away. I tell him to leave if he’s going to do that, but he says “no frick you I’m not gonna do that.” We finally get discharged, and on the way back he’s asking me the same questions again. When we get out of the Uber, I walk across the street to our apartment, and he just stays there. He leaves to go drink with his fraternity friends. And now I’m here alone at home with a huge headache and a concussion. \n",
      "The thing about this is that things like this I have happened before. I hit my head because I was trying to pick him off of the floor after he was blacked out and he left the apartment. He’s called me weak when I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression because he doesn’t believe in it. I’m just starting to hate him. I don’t want to. But it’s hard when somebody treats you like this, especially if you love them, and especially when they say they love you. \n",
      "I’m just tired and my head hurts. I don’t know what to do. He’s just hurt me so much and it’s obvious he doesn’t care about me. I guess I can’t beg him to love me, but I do still love him. When he’s sober, he treats me like a queen but when he’s drunk, his behavior is inexcusable. \n",

      "Title: At the end of my tether with alcoholic, severely depressed boyfriend\n",
      "Body text: My (27f) boyfriend (33m) of 6 years has within the last year developed very serious depression and more recently has started very heavy drinking habits. This culminated a few months ago with an involuntary stay in a psychiatric facility after a frightening withdrawal episode. After that, we moved states to a less stressful job for him and I thought everything would be okay from then on. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the depression and drinking has started up with a vengeance and he is drinking more than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "He will not move except to pace around nervously and go to buy more alcohol. He refuses to come into the living room or leave the house unless he is going to the liquor store. And believe me, he has plenty of reasons to be depressed- he never fully grieved the loss of his brother a few years ago and has undiagnosed PTSD from a deployment. He also has sustained multiple head injuries, which he doesn't care to go to the doctor for. The issue is that he absolutely refuses to seek out any treatment; rehab, counseling, therapy, psychiatry, nothing. Even my suggestions of having me drive him to appointments is like me talking to a brick wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship that he has been neglecting and I've been desperately trying to shield her from the reality, but the few times he manages to come to the dinner table he is visibly drunk and will start being a dickhead to both of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reading I've done on this subject suggests that unless the affected person is willing to take their treatment into their own hands, the relationship is almost certainly doomed. He doesn't even seem to fully understand that I won't put up with this for much longer. Every thing I say to him goes in one ear out the other. And then when I try to leave the room to work or to grieve quietly by myself, he follows me because he refuses to be alone while also not wanting help. He blames me for his drinking and depression (I have had issues myself, but I was always functional and was never that severe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Is my instinct right that this relationship is doomed? This is my worst nightmare come true, I have been with him for so long and he used to be so wonderful. But now I can't see a future in this relationship if he legitimately has no interest in bettering myself.\n",

      "Body text: I've (28 F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (29M) for a year. Our honeymoon phase ended about 6 months ago and we've been learning how to speak through differences that we have. It's been really challenging and my biggest concerns have been the topics of cats, dancing, and children. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love cats. I understand them and I find their company comforting. My boyfriend is highly allergic to them. When he first used to come over, my cat would be doing his thing: cuddling in bed at night and such. That made my boyfriend break out on a rash that was so itchy that he scratched until he bled. Now my cat isn't allowed on the bed, or even in the bedroom when he comes over. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love dancing. Specifically, I enjoy partner dancing and I'm really good at it. It makes me feel alive! My boyfriend says that he feels angry and jealous at the idea of me dancing with anybody else other than him. But we've not danced with each other and he would only want to take private lessons (which I cannot afford right now). Since he can afford lessons, he did propose that we do 2 private lessons a month. However, this has not come to fruition for two reasons: both of our cars have needed major repairs, and I also think that dancing is an extremely low priority for him. It's been 3 months since the lessons were brought up the first time. I am now forcing myself to go out dancing alone this month regardless of how he feels because I felt depressed not dancing. My boyfriend has said that he will not impose his feelings of anger and jealously on me and I must do what is right for me, but he will not work on those feelings. So far, he has not reacted in a negative way but I know he is uncomfortable. \n",
      "\n",
      "His stance on having children has changed. I am passionate about having a child in my future. I want to be a parent. When we started dating, he wanted children too. Now he says he will take responsibility for a child of he has too, but he is unsure because the right things need to be in place: financial stability; a stable home; and emotional stability. He's elaborated that he worries that I'm not emotionally stable (I have been actively working through my own childhood trauma and seen results). I believe working through trauma is a lifelong process, but that I'll make the strides necessary to heal before I have a child. However, this change in his stance has me concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that everybody's boundaries regarding what they tolerate in their life versus where they draw the line and move on from a relationship is different. How can I address this? I keep wondering if I should break up with him. But we both are putting in a kind and concerted effort into the relationship and we have huge respect for each other, so I'm caught between wanting to have my cat near me, and having to imagine a life without him ever being in my bed again. Always having to tread gently around my passion for dancing around him. And wondering if he's going to embrace fatherhood, or just accept responsibility for it and not jump into it with me. Is it worthwhile to pursue a relationship with this man, who is worthwhile, at the risk of parts of myself not being able to express themselves fully and comfortably? \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I've been dating my boyfriend for a year, and while we respect and care deeply for each other, key differences are creating tension. He's highly allergic to my cat, which now isn't allowed in my bedroom. He feels angry and jealous about me dancing with others but isn't prioritizing dancing with me, which has affected my mental health. Most significantly, his views on having children have shifted from wanting them to being unsure and questioning my emotional readiness due to my trauma work. I'm feeling anxious and torn between honoring my passions and future goals or staying in a relationship where I'm unsure if my core desires will be met.\n",

      "Body text: Hey everyone, I (27M) have been feeling burnt out from my wife (26F). My wife and I recently gotten married around 10 months ago, but together for 9years. We always had what I considered a great relationship. We found joy in small things, she did her best to understand my upbringing and culture. But before the wedding my wife has been anxious about fitting in the dress and starting losing some weight. I wasn’t a fan then but when we use to speak about she said everything’s going to go back to normal after the wedding. From our honeymoon to present she has continued to lose weight, and from 7 months ago has been diagnosed with anorexia. \n",
      "\n",
      "From before the diagnosis we would get into small fights about lack of sex, her feeling like I’m not attracted to her “new body”. I learned that comes with her diagnosis. I did everything that I can to be supportive. I’ve taken control of making meals for her, then convincing her to eat those meals with me, then have a conversation for the next 2hours regarding what she ate and how it made her feel. She recently left her job due to anxiety as well and I’ve done my best to adjust financially as well. Her doctor suggested therapy and I listened to the rules I was told, no showing her old photos, not pushing her to eat….then she lost more weight and now may have to stay at a hospital. We have been talking a lot more about treatments but that always ends in an argument. Almost like convincing an alcoholic that they have a problem. \n",

      "I guess my question is lately I feel myself becoming more and more short with her, I’m not excited to come home, meals feel like a war zone , almost every conversation we have is regarding food.

      "Also I guess some added things, she has been home for a couple of months. She’s been lying to me about eating and doctors visits. I may find out soon if she can stay at the hospital but she really doesn’t want too. We don’t have sex anymore we have tried but I couldn’t “react”. I know this is the illness talking but it just feels like she isn’t worried about this as much as me. Thanks again\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been dating an amazing girl for 7 months now. Her personality is the best I could ask for understanding, considerate, kind, unmaterialistic. She does have mental problems like insecurities, scared to call people but I couldn’t care less about them. And I did love her in the beginning. However recently I started doubting my own feelings. One moment I look at her and see the cutest being ever and then the other I just feel empty. I do have my own issues associated with childhood like abandonment threats when I was a kid and other abusive things revolving round my childhood. I was also raised to be as efficient as I could be and well we know relationships are not efficient at all.And so recently I was wondering what to do because I just can’t understand my own feelings. I either feel like I love her or simply nothing towards her. But when I imagine her cry I wanna cry and throw up. When I imagine breaking up with her I just can’t help but hesitate that im breaking smth that I shouldn’t. I just feel so conflicted and broken right now.

      "Body text: I’m a 21 yo male, I’ve had a 3 year+ relationship ship with my gf, 21 yo female. Lately I’ve been so selfish and focused on fixing myself and changing things that don’t need changed. We openly discussed this. I’m aware of the problem I’ve caused and I want to fix it. During this period of selfishness I’ve stopped showing my love to her. I stopped kissing, never say I love you until it’s said to me first, never come up with date ideas, I just wasn’t there. But I love this woman so much, she has saved my life and loves me unconditionally. I can never see that look of sadness again when I said that I haven’t been loving her. She said she won’t leave though, because she has to enough love for the both of us. So fuck me and my endeavors, I need to live for this woman again. I need to uncover my love that I buried underneath everything. I know it’s still there, how do I dig it out? How do I re-wire my brain? She said I used to be perfect until I tried to fix things that weren’t there. I need to get back to the real loving me. Does anyone have any kind of advice?\n",

      "Im a F (27) my bf of 5 almost 6 years is 34. He’s an amazing man and step dad he literally takes care of everything but he is not affectionate in general. He tells me he loves me as well as my son who he has been in his life since my son was 2 and basically helped me raise him.\n",

      "He never snuggles and never gives me random kisses etc unless he’s drunk. We smoke flower together and his personality doesn’t change but when he drinks he opens up like a Book. He tells me all about his life and gives me so much affection it feels like I’m in a movie.\n",
      "\n",

      "The reason I’m posting is because this happened again right now and all I can think of is I feel like getting him something to drink so that he can be nice to me again. But I feel like that’s not right. I know I should probably compromise and accept that he isn’t generally an affectionate person but it drives me crazy knowing he has the capability to do the things that would make me so happy and he just doesn’t unless he’s had a couple drinks.\n",

Im not saying it just cause, her uni is here (she takes online classes), there are way more opportunities in general (she doesnt even have food delivery to say one). Turns out she doesnt wanna move, she has a full time job rn and doesnt want to leave it and her family. We basically have no future I guess... but we love each other so much, what should I do?

I’ve tried going on dates but no luck. Lately we’ve been talking more frequently. She’s starting to watch the shows I watch, and me watch hers.

      "\n",
      "I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for around 2 years now. Just after the 1 year mark (mid year 2024) we moved in together. It was hard to adjust to but we really wanted this so we tried really hard to make it work. It was really hard and some weeks we fought every day and nearly called it quits multiple times. I felt very sad and very lonely. At the worst of it he decided we needed to break up (end of 2024) we decided we wouldn’t end the lease and just stay until it was finished. we had different rooms and our scheduled didn’t align so we didn’t really see each other that much. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time I was obviously devastated and depressed and extremely lonely. He treated me like he didn’t know me and like I was trash when we were out in public or with friends but at home he would try to be nice and friendly with me. It really messed with my head ALOT. I was so up and down not knowing what was going on. He started going out a lot and I felt even more lonely because he didn’t invite me to anything or want me around his friends really, I also tried to make plans with him but he was always “busy”. It was heartbreaking to feel rejected like that. Eventually I started going out with my friends more and having fun and I felt so alive again. Obviously I yearned for that comfortability and safeness that he gave me but I was having fun. I started talking to someone I used to talk to again and a guy I had randomly met had started talking to me. It was all going fine until one nice he came across the messages and was really really upset. In my head I believed he shouldn’t have been upset because he broke up with me but he felt as though it was wrong and I was leading him on? We had a big fight and I messaged those two guys saying sorry I can’t do this I’m just not in the right headspace at the moment which they both understood and respected. I tried really hard to win my ex boyfriend back over so he didn’t hate me. After a while of just putting my feelings last and just prioritising stability between us he finally stopped hating me. He felt that we were better and asked me if we could give things another go which I agreed to because I felt that we were better and I felt loved and appreciated. I felt that we could make things work and I felt safe and comfortable with him.

But I’m also worried that the grass isn’t green on the other side and that I’m going to loose such a lovely person in my life who I love dearly. My family also loves him and he is so lovely to my friends and is just a great guy. Because I know if we end he probably wouldn’t want to be friends with me again. \n",

      "Body text: So, I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 2.5 years, but we’ve been friends for much longer. In September, we moved out of my parents' house to a new city far away from out hometown, and I really like it here. She’s a very emotional person, and I feel like I can tell her everything, knowing she’ll always be there for me. I love her very much and care about her wellbeing. I also enjoy cooking, which is why I usually take care of the cooking in our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a rule that whoever is cooking doesn’t have to clean up afterward. This is mostly due to our tempers — we tend to fight over small things. Today we had another fight because I put away the ingredients after making dinner, but didn’t clean the countertops. I told her she should clean it, since I spent about 45 minutes cooking while she was playing Sims 4. She got upset and reminded me that she won’t clean up after me because I didn’t clean the kitchen after breakfast. Usually I make breakfast for the two of us or we eat alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told me she’s exhausted from living with me. The thing is, I feel like I do around 60% of the chores in our house. I have ADHD, so sometimes I forget to put a plate away or close a cabinet. I understand that it can be a burden for her when I leave these things for a few hours, but I’m the one cleaning the whole apartment every Saturday, while she only cleans the bathroom. I’m okay with that because, until recently, she worked on Saturdays.\n",

      "I have very little free time because I’m studying Electrical Engineering at one of the top 3 universities in my country, and I have to study A LOT. I also work part-time. When I do have free time, I try to focus on my hobbies, which are making music and skateboarding. I love my life and try to stay optimistic, even though it’s not always easy. I’m not passionate about my degree, but I want to secure a good job in the future, especially since my girlfriend is studying Vocal Jazz at a music university. Even though it’s very hard to get into, it probably won’t bring her much financial security. She’s not sure about this career path and often tells me she doesn’t belong there (although she’s very talented and trained a lot when she was younger). I remind her that she won’t get another chance to get a prestigious degree title with that little effort. Don’t get me wrong — she prepares for her classes, but it doesn’t take her much time. Also professor there are very little concerned about skipping classes, when at my Uni I can’t skip even one hour.\n",

      "She comes from a poor family, and I don’t want her to worry about money. I’m not rich either, but we’re doing okay. That’s why I pay for food and heating, and I sometimes buy her nice things. On the other side last month she didn’t even get me a birthday present because she didn’t have money, which I’m fine with. She ordered sushi so it’s not like she forgot, but a present don’t have to be expensive. Also it kinda itch me, cause a week earlier, she bought a fairly expensive gift for her friend.\n",

When I tell her I’m exhausted from everything or that I’d love to have sex more often (now, we do it like 2 times a month), because it makes me feel emotionally close to her, I don’t feel like she offers much empathy. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t love me anymore. I don’t want to sound like a jerk but I feel like I’m quite good looking and take care of myself and I could do better.  \n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone. I need some honest advice because I’m going through an extremely confusing and emotionally difficult time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for a few months. Our relationship started not long after she broke up with her ex, whom she was with for 3 years. At first, things seemed great — we connected deeply and fast. She had and still has some problems With \"lndependence\" In the relatlionship. We also had some discutions about traumas from her past and I've been trying my best to comfort her and be there for her. l did an unintentional mistake regarding consent 2 weeks ago (nothing fully sexual) and this triggered a heavy emotional response in her. This is why this whole thing happening at the moment. Until now i think she repressed her feelings regarding the ex since things were going wonderful between the two of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she opened up to me and told me the full truth:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She still has feelings for her ex, but she doesn’t want to go back to him. (not actual love\" but attachent because of things he helped her with)\n",
      "* She says it’s incredibly hard to detach emotionally, because he was someone who helped her build self-confidence and supported her deeply through a lot.\n",
      "* He still messages her and tells her he loves her — and even though she *wants* to stop talking to him, she feels unable to stop replying and so does he even if he knows that this is toxic for both of them. He sugested that she should try to stop texting since he is unable to.\n",
      "* At the same time, she says she has feelings for *me* but she i is still fighting with the trust that she lost in me after the incident that I mentioned earlier. \n",
      "\n",
      "She is seeing a psychiatrist for quite some time and is now looking for a psychologist as well, because she feels she can’t carry this emotional burden alone anymore.\n",

      "Meanwhile, I feel caught in a limbo. I am waiting to see if she can forgive my mistake. We go through beautiful, intimate moments in these months. We found how similar We are and We are both in awe regarding what a match we are for each other on multiple plans (love, money, hobbies/activities, family, etc.). She also presented me to her parents recently and i also presented her to mine. They said that for the first time in forever she truly seems happy. Now she emotionally pulls away, and I feel her slipping. I'm doing my best to be there for her, to not pressure her, to give her space when she needs it just as she asked of me. I've stopped initiating most of our conversations, and lately she's been the one to reach out .\n",

      "She told me recently that she feels like she’s about to emotionally explode and that she can’t take the pain anymore. It’s heartbreaking.\n",

      "But I’m also afraid that being in a relationship with me might be *adding* to her emotional pressure and confusion. Still, the idea of breaking up terrifies me. I’m scared that if I walk away to “give her space,” she’ll eventually heal — but move on with someone else. I know this may sound selfish, but I want to remain in her life *as her partner*, not just as someone who helped her in a rough chapter.\n",

      "* Should I distance myself? Stay close but with limits?\n",
      "* How can I support her without emotionally draining myself?\n",

Hes a top priority in my life, I message him daily, and as soon as I wake up, I let him know what I’m doing all the time, we call every night before bed, I make him stuff all the time (letters, paintings, diy) all kinds of stuff, I try to go all out for holidays and bdays, like I really love him. Anyways we both got new jobs about two months ago and we work the same hours but different jobs, anyways so we don’t msg as much anymore or talk too much throughout the day due to both of us working, and it’s about a 45 min drive from his house to mine and he’s the only one with a vehicle, so we only see eachother on weekends, throughout the week I start to miss him and get upset because he’s so busy all the time and we barely get to talk, I usually express this Wednesday nights I’ll make a comment, Thursday goes the same so I’ll bring it up again, but Thursday night we get into a disagreement and then friday sucks and I finally see him Friday night or Saturday morning, anyways he works 8-4 and then he goes home he calls his friend while he smokes and then he uses the bathroom and does chores that’s about 2-2.5 hours and then he’ll go eat with his dad which a 1-1.5 and then he gets home and he showers which is another hour and it’s usually 930-10pm when he is done and he’ll call me and I’ll try to talk and then he falls asleep and it upsets me because we don’t talk or spend as much time together and I just miss him and want to talk to him and I feel like I make time for him and I’m a full time working single mother to my 1.5 year old daughter and I have no help from her bio dad so I do it on my own and I understand he’s busy but I want to not be so codependent on him, I want to be able to let the man breath because I know I’m clingy but it’s not in a bad way I just literally love and miss him and it causes arguments and I hate that and I want to stop fighting so please anything helps how do I fix this?  I also feel like I put a lot of time into him and our relationship and he doesn’t, and it’s not that he doesn’t do anything he does a normal amount. I do a lot tho, I go all out for bdays and holidays, constantly make him things, buy him stuff I think he’ll like, and I feel like I’m overly obsessed with him and I don’t wanna push him away from being too clingy. \n",

I live downtown also around trendy restaurants and bars, close to the sports arena, 2 bedroom, nice city view and back balcony as well. Immediately he started commenting on my stuff. My couch, my tv, my bed, all my stuff. As we were eating dinner money was brought up and he asked how much I make and I told him, and he said “shit!”. And so I asked the question back and he did not give me an answer, but he said I definitely make more than him, and I said “that’s okay, I make more than a lot of people”. It’s not so much about how much someone makes, but how can they manage it and to me he is responsible. He buys his cars cash, we don’t go out a lot and he’s a chef so we still eat well. The conversation got really awkward. That next morning he asked about my toothbrush, “that’s a $200 toothbrush?” I said yeah then he asked about my headphones and he asked how much those were and I told him. Jokingly I said “are you about to rob me?” And he said “no you’re just fancier than I thought”. I wanted to hear more about that and he said that he couldn’t see where he would fit into my life because as a man he’d like to support me but he didn’t know if he could provide more than what I have now. Fair. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I address this to him in a respectful way and tell him I don’t really care about the amount of money, it’s really how much debt/income, your spending habits, etc? He’s stuck on salary and he’s an old fashioned guy. For context we dated when we were 21/19 and he broke with me by playing Drake ft. Rihanna “Too Good” because he felt like he couldn’t support me then. We were kids. So I know this is a soft spot. \n",

      "Title: I (F40) feel extremely hurt and stressed by my boyfriend (M40) not prioritising us in the way I would like\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend (M40) and I (F40) have been together for 5+ years. In January last year he was dropping heavy hints and I told him to spit it out and he said he wanted to get married/move in together/have kids. I told him that's great, but he's done no emotional work in our relationship. I pointed out to him that I am the one who's setting up our dates, making sure we see each other once or twice a week, and bringing up hard conversations. I told him that if he wanted to get married, we'd need to have those hard conversations and he needed to be able to do the emotional work, because if he didn't, I eventually wouldn't, and the relationship would fail. I told him he needed to initiate these conversations. We talked about the different topics we needed to talk about, and I told him he would need to look into the issues other couples had run into and their solutions to inform our conversations. He listened to this and said we would have conversations every week. I said \"wow, that's a lot\", but said I would leave it with him, and wouldn't say anything else because this was now his domain and I would follow his lead. I make sure to let him know he can ask for help, but he needs to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "By April, I hadn't heard anything about it, so even though I said I wouldn't say anything else about it, I checked in with him.. He said he hadn't done anything. A few weeks later, he told me he was done, and gave me a notebook with questions written in it and his replies. The questions were the first hit when googling \"questions to ask before marriage\" and some were not even relevant to us. His replies were 1 or 2 sentences. I was disappointed and upset, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to ruin our upcoming trip. He proposed on that trip. I told him \"it's not a no\" but clarified it wasn't exactly a yes either. We talked about what I had expected from him. We talked about why. We went through the notebook and talked about the things in there and he made notes for what we need to talk about further. He promised we would talk every week. We come back from our trip and we do not talk every week.\n",

      "In September he does a finance talk. This is great! I'm excited. \"Okay, what's next? What's the plan? What else do we have?\" I say and, well, there's nothing. I leave the country to travel for a bit and he says he will work on it while I'm away. In December I ask him if he has anything. He doesn't have anything. I ask him if he knows what I'm asking for, why I'm asking for it, and we go over the reasons AGAIN. He says he understands now. We talk about potential resources. I told him I know it's hard, but it's hard for me too but I STILL DO IT, like it took me 2 weeks to bring up that very conversation. I point out to him that if this was HIS JOB he would have done it by now. I point out how hurtful it is that he's not prioritising it. He again promises to have talks every week. For the first week, it happens. He tells me he's been reading the Gottmann books, and we go through an exercise they have. The next two weeks I am traveling again. When I get back, I'm sick for a couple of weeks. His sister is visiting. There are x amount of reasons that there are no talks. Shortly after Valentine's day, I decide that's it and try to leave. He mollifies me by saying he's been reading the Gottmann books and we just haven't had the talks because xx reasons. I tell him he needs to COMMUNICATE and try and make up for the talks. He apologises and agrees. We start having our Gottmann exercises. It goes well for the first few weeks, then they start petering off from every week to every other week. It's been 3 weeks now without one. He also initiated one discussion about me moving in and we've done general stuff around that, but no other discussions since about me moving in and the things I told him he needed to follow up on, or any other discussions. He has gotten better at planning dates and making sure we spend time with each other every week. \n",

      "I'm so stressed about this. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying I need to leave this guy. I sometimes feel like just pushing him out of bed when he misses initiating a weekly discussion.  I know emotional work is hard for men, but it's hard for me too. I love him and he's actually great otherwise (apart from his sometimes terrible taste in music) - he's gentle, emotionally supportive, learned how to give massages so he could give them to me, my friends like him, he cooks, etc., and I do want to marry him IF HE COULD JUST DO THIS ONE THING. I don't feel like I'm a high-maintenance girlfriend. I don't ask for much. I'm asking for this because if we don't have this the relationship will fall apart eventually anyway, and I have been telling him this over and over again. I am so stressed. I don't want to nag at him about this, because he either pioritises this or he doesn't. I don't want to spend the rest of my life having to nag a husband to do things that I have pointed out over and over again are important for our relationship I don't know what to do. Should I try again to have another conversation or is 17 months really enough time to realise he will never ever ever prioritise what I  think is important for our relationship? Of course there's the added complication about our ages. He wants kids. I think they might be great. But my womb can't wait another 5 years for me to realise he will never get his shit together, then find another partner and have kids with him.\n",

      "Body text: I (19) and him (20) moved together approximetly 1,5 years ago. We are now almost a couple for 4 years and since we moved together we have I would say a lot of fights. Its always about something small, something not important but everytime we fight it drains me completely. I often cry without a reason and I cry everytime we have a fight. I started doubting our relationshop after a while because I just felt sad all the time. I was the happiest person when we werent fighting. I still love him but last year around november he told me that a few weeks prior he used an app similar to tinder but to find friends. He wanted to find friends in our area because we moved far away from our families and I understood that. Then he told me he first wanted to only text other men but he couldnt find people he could be friends with. Then he switched to find female and male friends but still not a lot of success. Then he switched to look only for women and he texted a lot of them he said. That was our first conversation about that and I wasnt very happy about him looking for female friends but I knew how bad he wanted friends and also he said that he has no contact to any of those women and that he deleted that app. So fast forward to a few days later where he confessed that thats not the whole story. He then told me he texted primarly beautiful women and also started conversation with compliments (I would rarely get compliments from him) so that already hurt me a little. But then he proceeded to tell me that he also asked some women for their instagram or snapchat but he had already unfollowed them. Then he told me that he had also told a few women that he is single but he apperently just wanted to see how they would react. He promised me he would never to such a thing again but obviously I lost a lot of trust in him. There was a lot more and I tried to forget these things but there was nothing that counted as real cheating. I still dont know if what he did is cheating so please tell me your opinion. Now almost 6 months later I still think about it and I am not sure if it was the right thing to completely forgive him. Just as backround knowledge: I dont talk to my parents anymore and also dont have any real friends who I could talk with about this and I think that thats also a reason why I stayed. I dont have anywhere to go if I break up with him.\n",

      "Title: I screwed up my first relationship, and I don’t know how to live with that.\n",
      "Body text: Hi everyone. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve been in my first ever relationship for about a year now. She’s also 20, and it’s her second relationship. Honestly, it was something really special to me – we had our ups and downs, sure, but in many ways, it felt close to perfect. Until I messed it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give some context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her last relationship, her ex betrayed her trust. He was constantly in contact with other girls behind her back, liking and saving revealing posts on Instagram and TikTok, and then gaslighting her by saying it was all “normal.” Over time, she lost trust in him completely and broke up with him. It really hurt her, and I knew that. She made it very clear early on that this kind of behavior was something she couldn’t tolerate again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here’s where I messed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, she was using my phone and ended up in the “Recently Deleted” folder in my gallery. She found a screenshot I had taken of some random girl on Instagram leaning over a table – not naked or anything, but obviously showing her butt in tight clothes. I had screenshotted it like a month ago, realized how dumb that was, and deleted it. But it was still there in the deleted folder. She was absolutely shocked and disappointed – like she said she would’ve never expected this from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, she also checked TikTok on my iPad and saw my search history. It included the names of some girls – some we had gossiped about at work, like an ex of a friend or someone who came up in conversation – but also one or two typical TikTok thirst-trap creators. I didn’t like, comment, or save anything, but the fact that I had searched them up made it look like I was obsessively seeking that kind of content behind her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it instantly reminded her of her ex and that she felt like I was no different. She told me she doesn’t see me the same anymore. That even if she gave me another chance, she’d never be able to fully trust me again. She also said she’d always remember this and be angry about it, that I ruined something that had so much potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, I completely own up to it. I told her I’m not trying to excuse what I did. It wasn’t out of lust or craving for attention – it was more of a dumb Jeffrey-brain moment, a mix of impulsiveness, curiosity, and gossip with coworkers. I know it sounds like a cliché excuse. But I swear I didn’t mean to hurt her. And now I’ve become the exact person she was afraid of.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things even harder – literally the day she saw all this, she flew out on a two-week trip with her parents. Before this all happened, I had agreed to stay at her place to watch her cat and water her plants while she’s away. So now I’m here in her apartment, alone, surrounded by memories of a relationship that feels like it’s already over. A place that used to feel safe and full of love now feels cold and heavy. I feel completely destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how I’m supposed to live with the guilt if she decides to end things when she comes back. I don’t know how to move on knowing I ruined something with someone who, honestly, felt perfect for me – loyal, principled, kind, beautiful inside and out. I know everyone says that about their ex, but she really was special. I didn’t cheat, but I broke her trust, and maybe that’s just as bad in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for reading. I’m open to any advice or words that might help. I really feel like I’m drowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I (20M) messed up my first relationship by having some inappropriate content/screenshots and TikTok searches, which triggered my girlfriend’s (20F) trust issues from her previous relationship. She found it right before a two-week trip and now doesn’t see me the same. I regret it deeply and am watching her cat while alone in her place, feeling crushed and lost. I don’t know how to forgive myself or fix anything.\n",

      "Body text: 3 days ago my girlfriend of 9 months and I met up for a drink, when we saw each other we hugged, we kissed we asked how each other has been the past few days. Maybe 30 minutes later I could feel that something was off, she wasn't talking as much and there wasn't that connection. One thing to keep in mind is that my girlfriend is an avoidant, she shows those traits in our relationship. While we were at the bar I popped off the bar and knew that there was something we had to discuss. I maybe didn't bring it up in the best way, I came back out and said \"So are we gonna talk about something because I can feel that something is off\" she replied with \"I think we are having so many problems\" she started rambling and explaining her feelings which I tried to comfort her, it ended up with her saying that \"I think I should break up with you\" I tried to keep it together for the whole conversation but at the end I did get a emotional. I told her that we can work through these problems. I hugged her and told her that \"it's okay\". She said she needed space to think about everything, which is respectable I understand that. She said \"I'll talk to you later\" and we went our seperate ways. I followed up with her that night with a short text saying \"Don't feel and pressure to reply, I understand and respect the fact that you need space. I just hope you're doing okay\" she replied with \"Yes \\*My name\\*, I hope your doing good to\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been about 3 days now and I still haven't heard anything from her. But I should keep in mind that she had a full day of university the following day and a school trip for a whole day in a different city.

      "  \n",
      "UPDATED: I am essentially looking at this like a break up, somethings to note that I guess is hopeful is that she still has photos of us together on her instagram, one of us kissing, one of us in the first month that we met.

      "Long story short, we broke up because she realized that i am very restrictive about myself, and I get into my head about, for example, going back home very soon, and this pattern is recurring. I consciously attempted to prolong our dates, but when the clock hit 7, i get anxious to get back home soon. Although my parents arent really calling me or asking me where I'm at.

I am not a risk taker. \n",

      "And it is not like, they still have a strong hold on me, but i get the anxiety sometimes to fight with my parents and imagine the consequences. I was never physically abused. It was mental really. It was the silent treatments and offloading the anger onto someone else that really got me to be anxiously attached. And to top it off, i was never really given a chance to make my own decisions and to fail and get back up and have real experiences. Now all i am stuck doing is routine. \n",

      "Me and my girlfriend have had a on and off relationship while in highschool and it has also been a little rocky in our early adulthood. She is a student who is getting into nursing, and I am a pre med student who opted to get my school payed for by the military. We have been together for around 4 years now but have had a couple breaks, because of me being dumb. I haven’t been the best boyfriend but I have made grown from my mistakes. We have recently been in a lot of arguments because she really wants to get engaged and start a family very soon (soon being married at like 22, kids by 23 atleast). Where the issue is I don’t feel like I’m ready for that. Since I joined the military (air guard) I have been set back in time. I really am just getting into college and I personally feel like taking those steps would be a lot for me especially if I do make it into med school. She also doesn’t want me going away to the college I have been looking forward to for my whole life, she’s told me many times she just doesn’t see us working out. I am just at a loss how to feel and definitely get bad anxiety from it. I’m young so I’m just trying to figure it all out!\n",

      "20M in a 2-year relationship with my 20F best friend. We’ve known each other since high school, share everything, and she truly feels one-of-a-kind. But the romantic/sexual side has faded—she says she’s less attracted to me now, puts in little effort, and admits she’s been lazy in the relationship. I’ve tried communicating and adjusting, but nothing really changes. She says she wants to stay long-term, but I’m unsure if I’m settling or holding on out of fear. Some days I want forever with her, others I feel done. Do I keep trying or walk away before resentment builds?\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend (17F) and I (17M) have been together for 2 years — one year long-distance and one year living together. It’s been a rollercoaster, and honestly, I’ve changed a lot for the better over time, but I’m at a point where I feel torn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in September, I made a mistake. It wasn’t cheating, but it was a serious lie. She almost left me over it, and her mom even sat me down to talk about it. I felt incredibly guilty and promised I’d change and work every day to earn her trust back. Since then, I’ve done everything I could to be the best version of myself — emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’ve been more patient, more giving, and constantly trying to support her through everything. Even before I had fully grown as a person, I helped her out of a difficult home situation. I supported her move-in, helped her find a job, and always tried to put her well-being first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got complicated when my mom eventually kicked her out. I chose to leave with her, and in the heat of the moment during an argument between me and my mom, things escalated. My mom lashed out at me physically — hitting me on the head and pulling my hair. My girlfriend intervened to protect me, but that led to a fight between them. Looking back, it was just a toxic mix of emotions. Everyone was in the wrong — my mom for lashing out, my girlfriend for escalating it, and me for not diffusing the situation better. But now my girlfriend is asking me to cut my mom off completely, and after losing my dad not long ago, it’s incredibly hard for me to just walk away from the only parent I have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my dad passed, my girlfriend and I were staying at a homeless shelter with her mom and siblings. My cousin later took us in, and for a while things felt more stable. But because of the fight with my mom, my mom’s mom (my nana) was staying downstairs at my cousin’s, and my girlfriend didn’t want me going down to see them. At first she allowed short visits, but eventually she stopped me from going down at all. One day my mom made a long drive just to see me, but I wasn’t allowed to go down and see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions really blew up one night during an argument when my girlfriend started throwing things and yelling. My nana came upstairs and calmly asked her to quiet down because it was late, but my girlfriend felt disrespected and snapped at her. She later asked me why I didn’t defend her. This became a common pattern — anytime she felt “disrespected” by someone (my cousin, my nana, etc.), she expected me to defend her no matter what, even if she was the one being harsh first. And if I didn’t, it became an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a time my friend came over after my dad passed, and we drank and smoked together. It was one of the first times I had laughed and felt a bit of peace since my dad’s death. My girlfriend said I left her for my friend (she’s in our room the room right next to he living room) and made a huge deal out of it, even though I was constantly checking in on her and she had been asleep for most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, things got so tense between her and my cousin that my girlfriend called her family to come pick us up. My cousin informed my nana, and the situation escalated so much that the police got involved. We got separated, but I convinced my cousin to take me to see her again during spring break. I wasn’t planning to break up with her — I just wanted to see her. But when the time came to return, things didn’t go as planned, and we ran away together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were truly homeless at that point, sleeping in parks at night. I couldn’t go with her to her mom’s shelter because I wasn’t her biological child and social services wouldn’t allow it. We had no options until my grandpa stepped in and helped us out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue that’s been hurting me lately is how my girlfriend made me unadd my step-sister. I’ve known her since I was 8 and she was 6 — she’s my family. But my girlfriend doesn’t accept that, claiming she’s just “a female best friend.” I even explained the whole family dynamic to her — how my stepdad raised them when their biological dad wasn’t around — and my whole family would back me up. Still, she told me to tell my stepbrother I didn’t want Hannah (my step-sister) in my life anymore. She’d even ask me if I was bothered by what she mad me do, also that her sister backed her up and her family usually backs her up even if it seems wrong sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, when I visited my mom and got home at 7 PM instead of earlier, my girlfriend blew up. My mom works nights and sleeps during the day, she was mad I didn’t come home at 10AM or 12PM and I was just happy to visit and reconnect. But she turned it into a problem. Later, my step-sister tried to add me on Snapchat, and I declined the request without blocking her. My girlfriend found out and flipped out, saying I was a bad boyfriend for not blocking her entirely. Her mom got involved too, saying “If my daughter’s ex added her and she didn’t block him, would you be mad?” — even though Hannah is my step-sister, not an ex. My girlfriend didn’t correct her, and I just stayed quiet to keep the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expects me to do everything with her — if I smoke a disposable without her, it’s an issue. She even comes to the bathroom with me. I don’t mind doing most things together, but I need my own space sometimes, and she struggles to understand that. On Mother’s Day, I simply texted my mom “Happy Mother’s Day,” and she got mad, saying her mom actually deserved it more. My mom has apologized for a lot of things, and I’m trying to rebuild that relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve made huge changes. I’ve been more honest, more stable, and more committed than ever. But sometimes my girlfriend still brings up the mistake I made a long time ago, even when I’ve expressed how deeply those old mistakes haunt me. I’ve done everything I can to earn forgiveness, but it still feels like I’m being punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part is that I love her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want her to be with anyone else. But I’m starting to feel like I don’t have freedom anymore. I’m being made to choose between her and my mom, and after losing my dad, that choice feels impossible. I’ve sacrificed so much, and part of me wonders if I’ll ever be able to fully have both love and peace at the same time.\n",

      "TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been through a lot — we were even homeless together at one point. I made a mistake early on, but I’ve done everything I can to be better. She wants me to cut my mom off, and after losing my dad, that feels impossible. I’ve changed so much, but she still brings up old mistakes and expects me to do everything with her, even giving up people I’ve loved and known for years. I love her deeply, but I’m starting to feel suffocated. I don’t know how to choose between love and family, or if I even should.\n",

      "Title: How do I [F18] rekindle my relationship with my bf? [M18]\n",
      "Body text: I (F18) have been with my bf (M18) for about 4 month exactly today. In the beginning of our relationship, everything was amazing. He used to be head over heels for me even though I had went after him first. He met my parents and I had met his. He would make me feel loved. But for context, hes a high school wrestler and hes pretty good at what he does. Naturally, this meant that he’d be pretty busy with practices everyday and tournaments every weekend which takes up most of his time. This also meant that he’d cancel plans last minute and not be able to hang out with me weeks on end even though he says and promised that we can. He’d also not respond to my texts for hours on end. I have anxious attachment, so naturally I freak out and jump to the worst possible conclusion of him losing feelings or me not being a priority for him. In the beginning, he’d always be the one to text me first but now I’m the one always reaching out. I’d let it slide bc I saw the amount of work he puts in for wrestling bc his college and future career depend on it. Before we got together, he was reluctant to start anything with me because he knew wrestling would be his number one priority but we both agree that our careers come first and that’s why we got together with that understanding. We got together around January and things were fine up until mid March. Thats when I noticed a switch in energy. At first when I talked to him, he said it was bc he was burnt out and tired of everything which was under stable as he puts a lot of dedication and time into what he does. But my friends and everyone else I go to for reassurance when I overthink convince me that he doesn’t like me anymore and I let that get to my head and he’s left trying to reassure me and clean up the mess. In all our past fights, he always said that he loved me and that he’d try to make it work but last night we got into our worst one yet. In our last big fight 2 weeks ago, he said that he still loved me but he doesn’t feel the same feelings as the beginning of the relationship. For context this fight started because we were supposed to hang out yesterday after my senior prom as he has his last wrestling tournament half way across the country the next day and wouldn’t be able to see him for a couple days after. One of his friends had texted him saying that I was going to breakup with him even though I never said so.  From this, I realize that the main reason we’ve had this ongoing unresolved problem rhat comes up all the time is because I involve my friends in my relationship problems when I need reassurance and I go insane from my anxiety and that we don’t spend enough private quality time together. The only reason I want to salvage this is because his wrestling dies down after this weekend meaning that he’d have more time. As I was typing this I realized that I couldn’t post any screenshots. But long story short, he sends me a screenshot of one of his friends telling him that I was going to break up with him after the dance but I really wasn’t. He said he wasn’t going to deal with it regardless whether I said it or not bc he’s sick and tired or my friends and other people treating him like hes the bad guy for not making time for me. He said that he doesn’t know if he lives me anymore and that it feel like his love is starting to fade away. He said that theres still something and that at this point he didn’t know how much was left and that trying again felt like beating a dead horse bc things get slightly better when we try but fade after a bit. I had asked him why he lost feelings. He replied that it was a mix of my overthinking, the arguments, my friends getting involved, and the lack of time together. He said that it feels more like a good friendship and that he’s just going through the motions of a relationship everyday to keep it going.  I replied by asking him whether he ever actually meant it when he said he lived me in the past to which he replied that he did. He said that this loss of feelings only occurred within the last couple weeks of our relationship. I also replied by telling him that I still wanted to give it another shot bc I was doing better with my overthinking and that after this weekend he wouldn’t have any more tournaments for a while which means that we’d have more time together. He said that he’d talk to me about it face to face when he’s back on Sunday and decide after that. After this convo, I just don’t believe that he could just lose love like that bc love doesn’t just fade away that quickly. Can I salvage this?\n",

      "TL;DR: My bf said he’s starting to love me less and that the feelings aren’t there anymore as they were in the beginning and that it was trying to feel like a good friendship and that he can’t get it to come back even though he tried. I’m thinking that it’s bc we never had any time together and that my friends got too involved and that I overthink. I feel like if I stopped telling my friends stuff and spend more time with him since his wrestling tournament die down after this weekend I can bring back the spark. \n",

      "Body text: I 25F am dating my bf (25M) of 5 years and we have been through a lot. He recently quit his job to work on his start-up and ever since things have been going downhill. A) We hare back to being in a long distance relationship B) We have started fighting a lot and for some reason it has always been me being at the receiving end of things. Lately it has just been constantly feeling like i am the one fighting for the both of us. Coming to the core issue of it all- he seems very agitated and irritated at everything and I am being used as a punching bag to vent out. His startup is facing roadblock day in and out and I truly understand. I know this is HIS PASSION . and i want him to ace it but I also know its going to take time at least for the scale up he is aiming at. But he has been very impatient about it. Often times our phone calls would go on about \"I need an income soon\" but hey everything doesn't come at just the start , they take time . and this impatience boils up and he yells/ fights with me. But i don't feel bad I know he is going through a lot and I want to support him. But it is VERY OVERWHELMING , mind you I am doing a postgraduate course myself and sometimes i just break down . I am exhausted and I am tired. I have cut off going out with friends cause I dont want him to feel left out cause he cannot . Things have gotten to a point where he has said hurtful stuff like - Why do you make everything about yourself ? , For example - Whenever he is stressed if i offer comforting words - \"Dont sympathise for me , I am not a loser\". Cut to 2 hours later he would come and apologies'. and when I do not probe him further on whatever is bothering him - \"you dont even care \", and god forbid if i ask a question - \"YOU CANNOT HELP ANYWAYS , WHY TALK ABT IT\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot take it anymore. I have to measure each and every word I say to him . I am so afraid all the time of what he may interpret it to. ITS SUFFOCATING ME AND MAKING ME NUMB. All these constant fights day after day after every time he promises -\"I wont take it out on you\" Lately it has made me reconsider this entire relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "Please advice on how I should tackle this ? No matter what the outcome of our relationship . I would only and always wish the best for him. Please do keep in mind it is indeed a very tough situation he is respect but it is hampering my mental health and he doesn't realise it at all.\n",

I’ve sacrificed a lot to support him, but it’s now harming my mental health. He apologizes after outbursts, but the cycle continues. I’m reconsidering the relationship and need advice on how to handle this.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend (22M) of almost 5 years gets very defensive when I (21F) cry\n",
      "Body text: I’m a very depressed person and I cry A LOT. Often everyday. I also quit using nicotine a few weeks ago so I have been crying plenty more than usual (like for several hours at a time). Needless to say, I am just very sad. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mother is very emotionally intelligent and has always been extremely supportive when I am upset. My boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a family that was not so supportive and would meet displays of emotion with anger. We’ve been together for almost five years and I could count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen him cry— he definitely sees it as a sign of weakness and never wants me to look at him when he does. Because of his upbringing, he has no real ability to empathize and no skills with processing emotions. I believe he’s also been taught to think that anger is a normal and rational response when somebody is sad. It also seems as though there was lots of passive aggression in his household growing up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every single time I cry, he takes it personally and gets angry with me, or at least gets very very defensive. I always try to explain that it really has nothing to do with him and it’s not a personal attack, I just want some comfort or emotional support. Like, for example, when I cry about being lonely, he thinks I’m “giving him shit” for not spending enough time with me. Usually by the end he understands where I’m coming from, but it always has to come after a huge nasty fight where I usually end up just comforting him. He seriously has zero empathy when he sees me sad and is often very very mean, mimicking me and using an angry tone which obviously makes me cry harder. I can also see his face harden each time, like his eyebrows furrow in anger; when I tried to explain to him that my mothers face would soften when she comforted me, he genuinely didn’t understand what I meant by that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even when I was crying on the one year anniversary of my father’s death, no comfort. Not even a hug until I ask for one. It was so disheartening because it was the exact same thing as the year prior when my father died. My crying turned into an argument. When I asked why he didn’t comfort me, he said it was because I hadn’t blown my nose, and he was really grossed out. That was one of the most painful exchanges we’ve had. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love him so much and told him I’d rather work really very hard to understand each other and make this work rather than break up. I can see how these patterns come from his childhood and it just makes me want to hug little six-year-old him so bad. He’s never been allowed to be in touch with his emotions so of course it would be difficult. He’s not a bad guy at all. He’s fantastic and I know he cares about me. It’s just so discouraging for this pattern to continue when I have been begging him for years to please just offer me some emotional support sometimes and stop inserting himself into every situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also says he feels helpless when somebody is crying. He truly does not know how to provide comfort or make a safe space. I’ve tried to show him what that kind of comfort feels and looks like in all the times I’ve done it for him, but he never seems to pick up on it. He says he doesn’t know what to say, which makes me sad because I’m deeply hurt to see somebody upset and the words just come naturally at that point. I feel like that’s the nature of empathy. He truly lacks empathy. \n",

      "EDIT: there are a few things I feel inclined to clarify. Although I cry often, I do not expect to be comforted every single time I cry. The majority of these times are when I’m in the shower, or doing household chores alone. It is not normal for me to cry for hours. This is a recent response to withdrawal and is temporary. He also knew I’d face depressive symptoms when I quit, but encouraged me anyways because he understands it will be beneficial in the long run. I do NOT expect quitting to “fix” me. I do NOT expect my boyfriend to “fix” me. If that’s what you gather from this, I urge you to reread. A major part of depression is feeling like your emotions are burdensome to those around you and I very much experience that. I do a lot of journaling. The only time I will cry to my boyfriend is when I think it’s something we should address, or when it’s something huge and devastating, like my father’s death. Telling me I’m exhausting to be around doesn’t make a positive impact on anybody. I only want positive change. I do not expect him to fully understand my emotions either, but this is what you must understand— he has NEVER comforted me for any reason, because he has hardly ever received comfort. His response is almost always anger. I’m not asking for him to be my constant emotional support. I’m more so looking to HELP him (not force him) feel comfortable with emotions in general. I think it’s also worth noting that he has said on multiple occasions his favorite thing about me is the way I work through our emotional discussions. I wouldn’t be asking for this advice if we hadn’t both acknowledged it’s something we’d like to work on together. Please be kind. \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 2: I hope one day we, as a society, can move away from blaming women for everything and move towards providing help for men who are in clear emotional distress. This post was not made in regards to my mental health. My crying is not the issue, as my boyfriend wants to be better equipped to help me when I am sad. He wants to be able to express emotions as comfortably as I do. This is where I’m seeking advice and nowhere else. Thank you to the kind people who understood that. \n",

      "Earlier this year in February, I broke up with my boyfriend of a 2.5 years. The main issue was that he didn’t want to take the next steps in our relationship. I have a house deposit saved, and for the past couple of years, I’ve been holding off on buying a property because we talked about doing that together. He owns a home, and we had discussed selling it and purchasing a new one jointly — a place we could build a life in. But it just never progressed, and I got tired of waiting. So I left and moved out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, I had regrets — I really do love him — and we talked it out. We agreed to give the relationship another shot and start couples therapy to work through our issues. I moved back in about a month later, and we’ve had around six sessions of therapy since then. He says he finds them helpful. Personally, I find them frustrating. It feels like I’m doing therapy just to get him to talk about things that should already matter in a long-term relationship — like buying a house, planning for the future, or even celebrating milestones together. I feel like I’m trying to fix a relationship where the root problem is one-sided reluctance to move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I was clear about when we reconciled was wanting to be engaged by June this year. I even found a ring I absolutely loved with my mum — it’s $3000, which is significantly less than the $8000 we had previously discussed as a budget. I told him it would mean a lot to me if he bought it. His response? \"We're not in a good place right now.\" That hit hard — it felt like a convenient excuse to stall again, rather than actually move forward with intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The property situation has gone nowhere, too. He has every second Friday off work (today included), and we’ve talked about getting real estate agents in, fixing a few things up, and starting the sale process. It’s been months and he’s done nothing — no calls, no quotes, no prep. I know for a fact he’ll do nothing today either. It makes me feel like I’m the only one working toward the life we supposedly both want.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is where it just gets more disappointing. Last year I completed two Master’s degrees while working full-time. It was a huge achievement for me — mentally, emotionally, everything. He didn’t plan anything to celebrate. Eventually, after I told him I felt hurt, he gave me a bunch of flowers. That was it. Last week, my parchments arrived in the mail — another perfect chance for him to do something, even something small, to acknowledge it. But again: nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve told him that having a home together is deeply important to me. Not just in a material sense, but in the sense of building a shared life. It’s part of how I feel safe and secure in a relationship. But right now, I feel like I’m stuck. Like I’m waiting for a man who doesn’t actually want the same future as me — or is too passive to act on it.\n",

Got back together a week later, did couples therapy, moved back in, but not much has changed. I found the ring I want and asked him to buy it — he stalled. He hasn’t made any moves to sell his property so we can buy one together. He didn’t celebrate me graduating with two Master’s degrees. I feel stuck and unvalued, like I’m doing all the emotional work. Should I walk away for good?\n",

      "We’re both in college, although we go to different colleges and don’t really live close together. I recently started work experience, a necessary part of my college course (health and social care) in a care home. It’s about a 20 minute drive away from where I live and away from where my boyfriend lives. By recently, I mean I started last week and only went in for 4 hours Friday and 4 hours Saturday. This is an incredibly new experience for me. I live in the middle of nowhere and have never had anything close to a job before. I live with my grandparents, and my grandad drives me to and from the care home. Me and my boyfriend, for the whole time we’ve been together, have gone to each other’s houses every other weekend. He’ll come to mine one weekend, and I’ll go to his the next. He stays at mine from Thursday evening up until Saturday evening, since he works on a Sunday and needs to go home for that. I stay at his from Thursday evening to Sunday evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "This weekend is supposed to be my turn to go to his. However, because of work experience, I don’t feel like i’ll be able. Like I said, this is brand new, and my grandad is driving me there. My boyfriend doesn’t like that I don’t want to come to his this weekend because of work experience. He said I should just take the bus from where he lives to the town the care home is in. This sounds plausible, except the thing is that I have NEVER taken the bus alone. I’ve never had to take the bus. In the town I grew up in, everything was in walking distance and all my friends lived close together. The place I live now is in the middle of nowhere, and my grandad drives me everywhere because the only bus that comes here comes once a week on a Wednesday in the afternoon. I have anxiety disorder, and trying something brand new out of the blue is terrifying. I had an anxiety attack just thinking about starting work experience, and my boyfriend had to calm me down through that. He knows how bad my anxiety is, and yet he’s pushing for me to try something completely new on top of still adjusting to another thing that is completely new to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was telling him this, and that I just need to get used to this new experience first before trying something else new, and he got even madder. He said I should be able to push through the anxiety for him, and that he always comes to mine on a Thursday evening even though he’s exhausted after a long day of college. I told him that he knows how bad my anxiety gets, and he’s seen plenty of my anxiety attacks over something completely small and mundane that he would find easy or trifling at the most. He reiterated that he always goes out of his way for me and I should be able to push through my anxiety for his sake. He offered to even take the bus with me the first time to show me it will be alright. I told him that I still didn’t want to. Work experience is a brand new thing for me and I want to focus on adjusting to that first before stepping even further out of my comfort zone that I already was. He just kept getting madder and madder at me, swearing even more with every text. I said that whenever we argue like this, I always get scared that we’re going to break up. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he wanted to break up with me. He said he didn’t and that he really loved being with me. He just wanted me to come to his this weekend because he likes spending time with me. I said I love spending time with him too, but that I just wasn’t prepared to try one new things after another. I need time to adjust to a schedule before immediately trying new thing after new thing. He then said that I best be prepared for us to get nasty with each other because “we’re always horrible to each other after not seeing each other for a while”. I told him that I wouldn’t continue the conversation with him while he was pissed off at me, because he gets scary and horrible when he’s mad at me. He’s often mad at me for trivial things, and it is terrifying. Especially when he’s mad at me whilst we’re actually with each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "An example I can give is when he wanted to bake cookies with me, but I honestly wasn’t really feeling up to it in that moment and told him as much. He got upset and asked if I could at least stay with him in the kitchen whilst he baked. I happily agreed and went down with him. He then assumed that because I was now in the kitchen with him, I’d help him bake now. I told him I just didn’t want to, and he got mad and told me to go upstairs then and leave him alone. I got really sad and started making my way upstairs when he knocked something off the shelf whilst grabbing ingredients, and I rushed back down to help him. He had spilled some pasta, so I grabbed the sweeping brush to help him clean it up. He pushed the brush away and scooped the pasta up with his hands, and I audibly sighed. I said I just wanted to help, put the brush away, and went upstairs. He immediately came storming up the stairs, flung the door open, and yelled “slam my fucking door again and you’ll see what happens”. I was terrified. My mum did that stuff to me when I was younger, and the stuff that would ‘happen’ is that she would scream and hurt me. He knew this. I told him he was acting like my mum. He yelled back that if he was acting like my mum, then he’d be abusive. And that he is not abusive. He often tells me that he isn’t abusive and to stop acting scared of him whenever I flinch at sudden movement. I don’t flinch because of him, he’s never done anything to hurt me ever. I flinch because of what I went through as a child, which he KNOWS. He KNOWS what I went through and still tries acting like I’m portraying him as an abuser. I’m not, because he isn’t abusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I told him that I wouldn’t continue the conversation, I put my phone on do not disturb and went off to take my mind off of things. I came back a bit later to see this text from him: “Don't come over this weekend because you acting like im a fucking monster whenever I have any fucking emotions and not just rolling over to you”. I don’t understand why he’s like this. He used to be the absolute sweetest boy on the planet. Now we’re arguing all the time over trivial things. I absolutely do not want to leave him. I want us to find the root of our issues and work this out. I need us to figure things out. I need us to last. I guess my question is what the hell can we do to resolve our current issue and to stop arguing all the time?\n",

      "I  need some advice. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2,5 years and we had a really rough time recently. He avoids difficult conversations and has been dishonest in the past, which triggered my anxiety and made me lash out several times. Everything was fine until one big topic came up last year and since then it went uphill...I have a lot of trust issues and I have to work on them, I know. But his unhonesty to prevent uncomfortable discussions didn't help, so I stayed anxious. I often doubted his love because he didn't treat me the way I needed or the way he promised. Because of his unhonesty and his passivity, I would lash out and say mean and hurtful things because I was hurt myself...and I know it's wrong. I work on that. But his avoidance, not stepping up and digging his emotions away make it very hard for me to communicate in a proper way. I tried to communicate nicely, if that didn't help, I get angry...but now I just... didn't lash out and was more understanding. Because I couldn't bear his passivity anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past he was very loving, caring and gave me the love I need. It was the man of my dreams and he gave me a lot of reassurance. Even with his passivity, he tried to be understanding, as good as he could... but that went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would make promises and break them. He was not reliable often times because he often forgets things. I didn't feel like a priority. He liked half-naked girls on Instagram and didn't take accountability...he actually rarely did because he is hiding to prevent difficult conversations and then doesn't say anything. He represses his emotions and it makes so difficult to communicate. He has some traumas as well...Because I was hurt of his behavior, he told me several times that maybe he is not good enough for me...I am so sorry...\n",
      "\n",
      "I would cry a lot and he would reassure me that he loves me and would never leave me. It was difficult to trust because of his previous lies but he told me - I just have to trust him. And he needed to find out why he was acting more and more distant. He didn't know why, he had to figure out. Well, he showed me the last days that he really forgot about me. And I was so hurt that I needed some space. First, he contacted me but yesterday I didn't hear anything from him. Today I called him and he told me that he figured out why he was distant...he thinks he probably lost feelings for me and doesn't know whether he wants to continue this relationship. He is unsure about it. I understood but I cried and I am so anxious now...he will visit me today after work and we will talk. I am so anxious about this relationship, I thought we will be together, we loved each other so much. We wanted a future together. I know, I have a lot of things to work on but he has traumas as well, which he really needs to adress...I don't know what to do, I want us to stay together. What should we or I do? What should I say?

To cut the long story short, I visit my mom every day and I’m often at my mom’s while we message, he says say hi to your mom and I say say hi to your friend.

My mom asks me do I even know who he’s travelling with and I really don’t have a clue who this mystery person is.

I decide to jokingly push for a selfie with the friend, with the convo ending with him saying he feels he is pushed to prove something and that didn’t sit well with him.

Now I feel he is purposefully concealing something that’s so silly. I am at a loss of what to do or say.

      "Body text: Me F(22) and my boyfriend M(27) have been together for a year and a few months now, recently we moved in together because of my toxic relationship with my parents but i feel like our connection and chemistry overall has altered. Its true that we have been together not for long but we do a lot of things together. To give you some info, im still in uni, next year ill finish my RN school, and he works as a freelancer. He does bring the bacon home and I’m currently waiting to get employed by a store close to our home so i can pay utilities and groceries along with him. This was our deal when he offered me to move in with him. We had our ups and downs along the way and frankly i don’t have many friends, maybe one that i feel close to, with whom i can share my experience with, but i feel he’s being mean sometimes and i cant tell if its toxic behaviour or not. Whenever i bring up something that might bother me he gets very defensive and slightly aggressive. Not to me like hitting or so, but adopts a really passive aggresive position toward me and the problem itself rather than being patient and trying to figure it out. This led me to shutting myself down most of the times i have something to object. Also most of the times after we are intimate he doesn’t cuddle me, he speaks loudly when something i did bothers him even if its not a big deal. Don’t get me wrong, most of the travel i’ve done this past few months were paid mostly by him and he does pay when we go out or so, but i feel neglected in a way. I would give up all the travelling if he were to be more sensitive and attentive towards me, giive me a small gift from time to time or care for the stuff i bring up to him. I’m sorry for my english, its not my first language. Can you give me some advice ? What should i do? I feel alone most days and honestly i might go back home if this things continue.\n",

      "Hello, 25F here. The guy 26M I'm dating is a good human being. We've been dating for almost 3 years. Hard working and takes care of his family. However, he grew up with a single mother and had a troubling childhood in the sense he didn't have the stability in his home that children need.\n",

      "He doesn't initiate deep conversations and even when I do he will shut it down quickly saying repetitive stuff like, it'll be okay, I'm here. He shows love through stuff like dropping me home late at night or helping me out with my office work, all of which I have to ask for him first because he is so unaware of what is going on in my life. Is it childish of me to want a boyfriend/partner who is aware or interested in what Is going on in my life? \n",

      "Title: Boyfriend’s (M18) mom doesn’t approve of me (F20) but has never met me\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years, but his mom doesn’t accept me and I don’t think it’s just because of religious differences. I used to do tarot readings when I first started high school, long before I ever met him. His family is very religious ( he’s a Christian and I’m Buddhist) and when his mom found out about that part of my past, she was really upset and told him to stay away from me. I understand where she’s coming from, since those things can be seen as going against her beliefs. But I had already stopped doing tarot before we even became serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We met in high school during my junior year and his sophomore year. At first, we were just friends and hung out a few times in May. Things became more serious around August of my senior year, we’d walk home from school together and really started building a strong connection. But when his mom found out, she got angry and made sure he didn’t walk with me anymore or spend time with me. He’s told me how she acts cold or petty whenever she knows we’re talking or sees the gifts I’ve given him. One Christmas, I gave him matching plaid pajamas, and when she saw them, she said, “Why don’t you go live with my name? She can buy all your clothing.” I laughed when he told me, but deep down, it hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She doesn’t like that we still talk or even that he sees me briefly when I pick up my sister from school. I graduated a year before him, and he’s graduating this year (2025). She works in the school district, and while I was still a student, she told one of my teachers or counselors that she disapproved of our relationship and would never accept it. I felt so humiliated, I cried after hearing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, he showed me a message from her where she said she’ll never approve of our relationship, that I’m not meant for him, and that if he wants to be with me, it won’t be allowed under her roof. She said he has to choose between me and her, that he won’t make her happy if I’m in his life. She even said she’ll continue to spoil him, but never with me around. We’re only about two and a half years apart in age, and she knows that, but that’s never been an issue for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I haven’t really talked about is the fact that I graduated high school a little later than most people. I came to the U.S. when I was six, and because of my late birthday, I didn’t start elementary school until I was seven. That pushed my school timeline a bit, it’s just part of my story (for the title).\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we talk every single day. He’s always been loving, supportive, and constant. One night, he even called me crying. He said he doesn’t know what to do, that he doesn’t want to have to choose between me and his mom. Hearing that broke my heart. He told me he wants to invite me to his graduation, and while I appreciate that deeply, I feel nervous. I know I’ll see his mom there, and I know how she’ll react. He’s also having a graduation party, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll be invited. I understand why but it still hurts. It’s painful because we live just five minutes apart, but we’ve never been able to see each other outside of school except for a few moments in the parking lot when I pick up my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went an entire summer without seeing him, and now that graduation is approaching, I’m preparing for another summer apart. Lately, especially this past week, I’ve felt overwhelmed with sadness. I’ve cried a lot and started acting distant with him not because I blame him, but because the weight of his mom’s disapproval is just so heavy on my heart. What hurts the most is that his mom has never even met me. She doesn’t know who I am she’s judging me based on my past and on assumptions about my beliefs. And I don’t know what I did to deserve that. I’m his first girlfriend, his first love. I just want the chance to be seen for who I really am, to be with him. \n",

      "Body text: I’ll try to keep this short. I (19) decided to drop off some stuff at my mom’s house, and I walked into my sisters (17) bedroom to say hi just to see her laying down with her ex (16). I seriously tried to keep my chill, but this guy literally got expelled from my high school because of their relationship. I blocked him on everything from her phone to keep them seperate. She always told me she would never get back with him, and always was grossed out by him. The fact she’s back with him after everything? She went to therapy because of him. He texted me that I’m a “faggot” and told me he would break my nose. I had to report him to the cops. This is absolutely unbelievable in my opinion. The fact that I haven’t even covered half of the stuff he’s done should show why this is crazy. I have no clue what to do. I’m going to just give up on her, she’s on her own with this one. But, since she’s my sister I genuinely have no clue what to do now. \n",

      "Body text: Me ‘M23’ and my girlfriend ‘F21’ have been together for almost 4 years now, and we met in a very vulnerable place in both of our lives which caused us to lean on each other so much, and were both very clingy, always together, telling each other we miss one another even though we just saw each other, it felt like the honeymoon phase lasted for a long time, we were both very different from who we are now.  We fell for each other very fast and had no one else to fall back on, we’ve been living together for about 3 years, and I always planned on asking her to marry me, and she wants the same.  But recently I’ve been finding myself and realizing all the things I want out of life.  I don’t want kids which is one of the main problems in our relationship, as we’ve talked about it multiple times since she wants kids but we both have kind of avoided the conversation and told each other that we’re too young to be worrying about that, we love each other very much and always figured we’d cross that bridge when we got there. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel I’m finally happy with who I am and what I want to be, I take care of myself, working out, and dieting, I want to travel the world and maybe even end up living in a different country that I like, one of my goals is to go skydiving, I absolutely love horror films.  I know I have one life and I want to make the absolute most of it, especially since my childhood was spent in a bubble my parents created as a Jehovah’s Witness, I left when I was 18, they took my car and I’ve been on my own since.  I’ve always been terrified of being myself until now. \n",
      "\n",
      "She wants kids, I know she does, she has kind of let herself go and gained a lot of weight, always wanting donuts, never going to the gym with me, she hates scary movies because it makes her anxious so she never ever watches with me, which I try to watch her comedies and reality tv shows, always putting in effort so we can watch something together.  she wants to travel but wants to stay close to her family living wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I’ve just been kind of stressed lately, the longer we’re together the more she expects to get married but the longer we’re together the less and less I feel I want it even though that’s what we always talked about, and I know that telling her my thoughts have changed will break her heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just genuinely scared of hurting her, I love her very much and want only the best for her, but I feel she’s noticed me pulling away recently.

      "\n",
      "I’m so thankful for everything we’ve been through together, her family has treated me like a part of them and don’t regret any of what we’ve been through, but I think I’m ready to go out on my own, which is absolutely terrifying since I don’t have family in my life, I would have no one, completely starting over, and it would be a long and painful transition as we live together, have a joint bank account, have always thought we would be together forever.  I just know it would break her heart to pieces and I’m genuinely scared she won’t recover.  \n",

      "Title: My 18 yo (M) boyfriend is so negative and down in the dumps. I 18 (F) have tried to help, but need more help.\n",
      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been together for around 3 months, I care for him a lot. One thing has become a recurring issue though, his anger. (I will also admit that I am very much like him in some of these actions, but I have managed to keep it contained and know how to control it. ) He tends to get angry at small things, but he doesn’t let that anger go. Instead, he lets the small things continue to add up. One example, he loves bowling and we go pretty much every week.. He gets very frustrated anytime he does not get a complete strike, which i don’t understand simply because I’m happy to get 6 pins. Anyways, he got frustrated and started to basically throw the rest of his balls and did not care anymore. He continued to be mad in the car ride home, his car was making a strange creaking noise, which he also cursed at. I usually sit in silence when he’s like this, as a trauma response because i don’t know how to deal with angry people. A couple hours later he was still upset and laying on my floor at this point, banging his hand and his head. I try to coach him through this and offer my support, asking him how he feels and why. But he always responds with “i don’t know”. He’s told me that he has no thoughts in his head, at all (which is wild to me as an ADHD person lol) and simply doesn’t know why he’s upset or how he’s truly feeling. I feel as though he does have thoughts, he just suppressed them as a trauma response. One thing i’ll mention is that his mom is quite manipulative, he lives at home with both of his parents. She tends to say things about how he’s not doing this or that good enough, especially using religion to guilt trip him (saying he’s not being religious enough or something). I want to help because I know this anger is deeply rooted and most likely he’s just a boiling volcano with a cap covering it (if the analogy doesn’t make sense i mean like pretending it’s not there, when it VERY CLEARLY is.) This is all quite jumbled but overall I would just like tips on things to say maybe or how to coach him through these feelings. Oh and also he doesn’t like to cry, because he says that other people have it worse than him so he shouldn’t feel bad. Which I tell him that he is very much allowed to feel however he feels, he’s human. Anyways, thanks for the long read lol, just want to offer my support instead of leaving. \n",

      "Body text: A few months ago, my boyfriend told me that he felt sad because he believed we didn't have much in common with each other. I thought it was strange and disagreed because we bond over many similar subjects, such as our love for history, science, movies etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "He clarified that what he meant was that we didn't have many shared hobbies together. Which, I would have to agree because aside from hanging out with each other on dates, we kind of leave each other to do our own hobbies. I wasn't bothered by this arrangement because like I said, we still had a lot in common and hung out often.\n",
      "\n",
      "But clearly, he was bothered by it so I set out to make some changes. Two of his biggest passions are the gym and playing video games. It seemed like it helped out at first. He appeared really excited when he helped me build a gaming PC and started playing games with him. He also seemed happy when I joined the same gym as him and was teaching me how to use all the machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually really liked it, and a lot of our dates started involving going to the gym together. Things seemed good for a while. More recently, my boyfriend told me that he was upset and stressed out about something, so he asked if we could go out to an arcade to take his mind off things. This was pretty late, like past 9, so all the small arcades in our area were either closed or about to. I suggested that maybe we go to the gym, which he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, I noticed that he had a very sour expression on his face. Like he was in pain and really didn't want to be there. Actually, that whole night I noticed that he hardly spoke to me and would give very short or one word responses. I knew that he was upset from the get go and didn't expect him to be cheerful or anything, but it almost seemed like my presence was just making him feel worse. That's the way I interpreted it at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that maybe he received really bad news, or something serious happened to him. I tried to ask him about it, but he insisted that he was fine and nothing serious happened to him. So, I thought that maybe it was just that he faced one bad luck situation after another with the arcade being closed, which left him more upset than he needed to be. Still, just in case, I asked him if he really wanted to hang out that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then admitted he was upset because he STILL felt like we didn't have enough shared hobbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very shocked and confused to hear that because that night, all we tried to do was stuff he liked. We literally tried to find an arcade and then went to the gym. I was genuinely confused because aside from those two things, I have never known him to participate in anything else as much. He literally goes to the gym every day and games almost every day. (whether I join in or not)\n",
      "\n",
      "I even asked in that moment what other hobbies/interests was he talking about. What else did he feel like I was missing out on? He said \"I don't know, but that's just how I feel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on I actually spoke to a few of my male friends asking why my boyfriend would feel this way. (I thought maybe this is a predominantly male issue) They suggested that maybe he resents that I'm not on the same \"level\" as him for his hobbies. For instance, I'm not an avid gamer and not as skilled as him in the game. He might also dislike that I'm not on his same level fitness-wise, like he wishes he had a \"powerlifter girlfriend\" or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if that's the real issue going on. Personally, I think that resentment is a part of it, but that maybe my boyfriend doesn't like that I didn't \"naturally\" get interested in his hobbies. He had to tell me that he wished I was, which got me to participate in them.\n",

      "Body text: Hey guys I’m a (23M) and my girl is (20F) we’ve been together for about a year and 8 months now. This was the greatest relationship I was in she always reciprocated and we felt as if this love was mutual and not like one from our generation. Loyalty respect no toxicity. She’s amazing and has all the qualities I want we worked thru so many things together that we thought would break us but came out stronger. The biggest thing was when I was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. For the past year I was enduring heavy chemotherapy and it changed how I looked and made me very nauseous and tired. We weren’t talking as often but we still made time for eachother and it was during that time that I started having problems and noticing she was distancing herself from me but whenever I’d come out and complain about it she would say things are just tough and that she’s sorry and will do better. Some of these things are replying hours later, dissappearing without knowing where she is for 3+ hrs. I felt hurt when she would make me feel like not a priority in her life and one day I was the in the hospital waiting to talk to her all day and she decided to call me at the end of her night when I was already tired and ready to sleep. This was when I told myself it’s time to pull my love back and start focusing on myself. A week later she noticed it and was like I want my man back. But this is the only way I won’t feel hurt giving 100% when someone gives 60% for so long. So I ended up matching her energy and she had a problem with it. Fast forward we worked on it and I was healed from cancer a couple months ago and started growing my hair back and my life is slowly returning to me. I’m going to the gym and gained 20lbs I’m looking and feeling good. But now I got so used to the distance that she gave me that I’m starting to distance myself and focus on my own self because I don’t want to feel hurt when I demand something but she says sorry and doesn’t change. She also said to me hey when you get better I hope you never change on me. How can I keep loving someone that I don’t feel compatible with anymore. She doesn’t love me how I wanna be loved. I’m always feeling lonely in this relationship. The things I love to do she never makes initiative to do with me so I just do it alone now like watching movies or shows, going out together cute romantic dates that I’d want to go on with her. I feel as if I’m in love with the potential and idk but I want to leave I feel like shit cuz why would I leave after she stayed with me thru my one year cancer journey. Any ideas or thoughts. I know she loves me but her love isn’t enough to make me feel satisfied. I’m very conflicted right now.\n",

She supported him through a tough year of cancer and chemo, but emotionally distanced herself during that time, making him feel unloved and lonely. Now that he’s recovering and doing better, he feels they’ve grown apart—she doesn’t show love the way he needs, doesn’t share in things he enjoys, and he feels more alone in the relationship. He’s conflicted because she was there during his hardest time, but her love no longer feels fulfilling or compatible. He’s considering leaving but feels guilty.\n",

      "Body text: This sounds supperr weird and I know I’m not overreacting. But lately I was feeling like things were going good and we’ve been having a good few weeks. Then I started to have dreams that he may be talking to a girl and whenever I’ll tell him he’ll just say that I’m just overthinking about our relationship and he’ll never do that to me, obviously I believe him because I know I tend to overthink A LOT(this dream happened a month ago). Then things started to get weird when me and him experienced a pregnancy scare which then led to a chemical pregnancy. I was telling him he’s distancing and I need him because Ik me and him have different ways of communicating and expressing ourselves. He then told me he’s gonna do his best for my needs and was being expressive ever since. Then I started getting this feeling that I should check his phone at least once to make myself feel better because he gave me the password before and I just felt like I never had to do anything like that before. So when he came over and we were just hanging out in my room time goes by and he’s about to leave and I ask him can I through his phone. When I go through his phone I see a girl so I obviously I open up the messages and then I see a sexual post sent to her I then asked who is she and his whole body language changed and asked me to give him his phone back and I told him no and kept scrolling and saw flirting messages between the two. It made me sick to my stomach to see it. This was a day after I told him about the cheating dream which hurt me even more they hadn’t texted recently when I saw the messages but it still hurt me we’ve been together since January and I just feel hurt by it. We talked about everything and what led up to it he never blamed me only himself and said he wants to do things right and attempt to be forward. It felt pathetic I was believing every word he said but I know that he meant it?\n",

When they had a break she was supposed to go to prom with him and she left him then telling him she found out she was pregnant by another dude. I felt sorry for him but I was still hurt and told him his past has nothing to do with me bc I too was in a toxic relationship but he doesn’t have to pay for that at all. He kept apologizing saying he can be better me being me I took him back because I care for him…he gave me his password to his phone and is being more in tune with us but idk how to feel.

      "Title: I (21F) get jealous of my partner (22M) having friends\n",
      "Body text: I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for nearly four years and our relationship is great. Apart from my jealousy issues. We went to school together so I know his friends and he also knows mine, so it’s not even an issue where I feel they could be bad people and not good influences. But I HATE whenever my boyfriend hangs out or wants to make plans with them. I am just seeking some advice on how to get over this jealousy, as I always try and feel that I’m fixing my brain until the next time he says he’s going to the pub and I get so jealous and sad that he’s spending time with his best friends. If I didn’t have friends it may be slightly  more understandable but I have the same number if not a few more friends who I love and always hang out with too, but I just get so sad when he does. I know it’s my brain thinking that as soon as he spends time with other people he loves and they make him happy he’ll no longer want to be with me and think I’m boring/not worth having in his life. He tells me that I need to try and see it just like my own friends, that it’s separate and me loving my friends doesn’t take away from any of my love for him, but it’s hard to do. As soon as we start talking about summer and he says he’d like to go on a few weekend holidays with his friends I get so upset about the fact he wants to hang out with them, part of me wants to be the only thing in his life that makes him happy, but the other part knows it’s such a good thing he has other people to love as well as me and we are both whole without each other. Please looking for some advice on how to stop this way of thinking and accept that the person I love also has love for other people and the fact he wants to spend time with them and they make him happy and laugh and get excited doesn’t affect our relationship? Thanks :)\n",

      "Body text: I apologize in advance if this post gets a little messy, but I would really appreciate some outside opinions on my situation. I will try to provide all the relevant details so you can form a clear understanding of what's been going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner \\[27M\\] and I \\[27F\\] have been together for almost three years. Overall, our relationship has been great, and he’s everything I’ve wanted in a partner. However, we’ve had quite a few arguments about his family, which I’ll explain below.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:**  \n",
      "We are both Asian, and my boyfriend migrated to the country we live in after finishing his studies here. His immediate family is back in his home country. I have a stable job and have tattoo sleeves on my arms, whereas my boyfriend doesn’t have any tattoos and likely never will, though he’s never judged me for mine. I come from a broken family, with divorced parents and a mother who has a criminal background. I did not went to university but hold a decent paying job. I no longer have a relationship with either parent but was raised by my uncle and aunt, with whom I am close with. In contrast, my boyfriend's parents are still together, but his father is currently serving a sentence for a financial crime. My boyfriend and his younger sister \\[28F\\] provide partial financial support to their mother and youngest sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Situations with His Family:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Initial Judgment:** Before I even met his family, his mother judged me based on my appearance from my social media account, particularly my tattoos, and made some hurtful comments. While I was hurt, I tried to comfort myself by thinking that she would view me differently once she got to know me. My boyfriend also stood up for me, calling her out for judging me without having met me first.\n",
      "* **Spending Time Together:** After some time, his mother and youngest sister visited us in our country. I made a real effort to bond with them, and our time together went well. However, after their visit, my boyfriend received phone calls from his mother, questioning if I was really who he wanted, making comments about my height and weight (I’m 153cm and weigh about 43kg), and criticizing my family background. I struggled to understand how she could judge me for things I had no control over, especially given that her family was also dealing with their own struggles due to her husband’s situation. They were blindsided when my partner's father was caught as he had been lying to them all these while. \n",
      "* **Questions About Money:** When his youngest sister first met me, she directly asked about my salary. On another occasion, she told me that their mother wanted my partner to find a rich girlfriend.\n",
      "* **Behavioral Issues with His Sister:** His youngest sister has behavioral issues and has been rude to me on several occasions. Just to quote a few examples, she called me “stupid” during a game and commented on my clothes by saying, “You’re wearing that?” To be fair, she behaves this way with everyone, not just me. However, I’ve had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about his sister’s behavior because I genuinely care about her and want to see her improve. After those talks, my boyfriend became stricter with her, making her more aware of her actions.\n",
      "* **Religious Views on Travel:** His mother has opposed us traveling together due to “religious reasons.” However, when we took her and his youngest sister on an all-expenses-paid trip, she had no problem with my partner and me sharing a room.\n",
      "* **Accommodation Issues in His Home Country:** When we visited my boyfriend’s home country, his mother expected me to stay in the hotel alone as she didn't want us to be sleeping in the same room as people would talk, despite the fact that it’s unsafe for women to be alone in his home country. Interestingly, his mother had previously stated that she would prefer her daughter’s partner to personally accompany her daughter home. This hurts me as it feels like a double standard and that the same consideration isn't shown to me as my partner's girlfriend. My partner did rejected what she said and stayed with me in the hotel throughout our visit back in his home country.\n",
      "* **Financial Concerns:** My boyfriend supports his mother and younger sister financially, which I’m fine with, as I am financially independent. However, there have been a few things that have bothered me. For instance, his mother feels it’s okay to buy a $200 handbag without any concern but then asks my boyfriend to reimburse her for a $35 toll when they drove us around during our visit back home. When she visits us, my partner and his younger sister cover all her expenses, including food and shopping. She then spends money on things I consider unnecessary, like a $40 lip tint for his youngest sister. His mom even spent $20k (which she claims is her own savings, so it’s justified) to bribe lawyers to help her husband in prison. Despite this, she criticized my boyfriend for not visiting her during Chinese New Year, accusing him of not stepping up as the “man of the family.” She also made comments about our spending, despite the fact that we had just taken her and his sister on an overseas trip, splitting the $10k cost ($5k each) between my partner and me, which she didn’t seem to mind when it was spent on her. We’ve also made the effort to bring them to the country we live in several times and went back to his home country to celebrate his youngest sister’s birthday. She even attacked me personally, saying that she thinks I control my partner and that I’m only so open to traveling alone with him because I don’t have parents who would care about me.\n",
      "* **Family Judgment:** His mother has not been overtly rude to me in person, and despite everything that’s happened, I’ve always tried to show her respect and care. However, I feel like my efforts are not being reciprocated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our arguments often stem from my frustration with how his mother judges me and how no one in his family seems to hold her accountable for her behavior. While my boyfriend defends me, he tries not to say anything too hurtful to his mom. On the other hand, I’ve always been someone who has no issue calling out my family if they’ve crossed a line. This difference in approach has caused tension, and it makes me feel like he’s protecting his mom's feelings while she doesn't consider mine. I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on how we can handle this situation. It’s tough because I understand my boyfriend feels stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I don’t want him to feel like he has to choose between me and his family. But at the same time, I don’t feel like my efforts and boundaries are being respected. I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this situation with him and his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost three years. His family, especially his mother and younger sister, have made hurtful comments about me regarding my appearance, family background, and financial status. Despite my efforts to build a good relationship with them, I feel like their judgment of me is constant, and my boyfriend seems stuck between protecting his family and supporting me. I’m frustrated because I feel like I’m not being treated with respect, and I’m seeking advice on how to handle these tensions and communicate with my boyfriend about it.\n",

      "Title: How do I have a better sex life in a long term relationship?\n",
      "Body text: I am in a lesbian relationship, Im 19 and she is 21. We had lots of sex in the beginning, and it was good sex. We were long distance so that also gave us time to miss eachother sexually and when we would visit eachother for a few days or a few weeks we would have sex almost every day and for hours. Its also my first longterm and lesbian relationship. She was the first person to ever make me orgasm, and our sex life was the best id ever had before. I have a high sex drive and im a very affectionate person. I feel most loved through phsyical touch and intimacy.  Ive done research about it and its the same for quite alot of people at the start of a relationship, its called spontaneous desire. Everything was new and exciting and we werent stuck in a routine with eachother or used to eachother, so the sex life was great and it was regular. We  both initiated equally and there werent too many concerns. Some things happened at about 4 months into dating, my partner experienced trauma with people in her life and she went through alot and moved away from those people to my state to live with me. As soon as she moved in with me, our intimacy and sex life declined almost instantly. This was because she was dealing with alot mentally, she left her whole life behind, her family and friends and was not very mentally stable. This of course caused her to not have anything to give to the relationship and I felt heartbroken because everything stopped, our hugs, kisses, dates, closeness, sex, everything. The intimacy with hugs and kisses has come back as time went on and I gave her patience, she tried really hard to show me love better because she could see how much it was destroying me. We would fight almost every day, it wasnt a happy time. Things have gotten better, we still fight sometimes but usually over small things that kind of blow up really quickly and then we resolve it and things are find. She is a good girlfriend and she does alot for me. The only thing that has been an ongoing issue is the sex. I think about it all the time and its really messing with my head. We have now been together about 8 months and our sex life is still not where i want it to be. She hardly initiates, shes been been training for 9 weeks at a new job which has \"sucked the life out of me\" as she says. I want to be desired, I want to feel wanted like I did in the beginning. I have stopped bringing up my issues with how much sex were not having and tried to stop pressuring her as she told me that would help it go back to normal, but I go weeks without mentioning a thing about sex, not showing the sexual side of me and I refuse to show it or it might pressure them and delay even more time until she wants to have sex with me again. I never initiate anymore and if i do initiate I get major anxiety and overthink before and during the sex and dont let myself enjoy it. Im usually overthinking too much that she doesnt want it, or if shes enjoying it, or if she actuallly wants me or just feels too bad with saying no to me and making me feel rejected.  My head is filled with thoughts about sex, not just me being horny but me being so terrified of things gettings worse as our relationship continues. I am even getting terrified of having kids because if this is my sex life when im this young, weve only been together 8 months and its only about once a week we have sex (which is not enough for me personally but everyone is different). I am panicking. I have done research on desire and how to keep your sex life alive. Doing things like still going on dates and still triggering eachothers desire with long passionate kisses, flirting, etc. I have realised its normal to not feel horny all the time or in the mood out of the blue like at the beginning of the relationship, you have to prioritise it and make the effort. I am devastated knowing my girlfriend has never had as big a sex drive as me from the beginning and that ill never experience things like spontaneous sex in the morning or being woken up in the middle of the night, or during the day on a random Saturday. Life is getting busy which is normal but im struggling with this part of me that craves closeness and connection through sex. Im so stuck on what to do and I am even questioning if id be better off finding someone more compatible with me sexually, i just want to have a good sex life especially when im this young and not have to constantly worry about it I just want it to be easy and flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love my girlfriend, I love the life we have together in our little home and with our cats, I love them so much and I continue to love them every day. But this one part of our relationship is destroying me, its building anger and resentment. I am constantly trying to find a solution. Im angry that this is our sex life and its just me always waiting to be wanted and desired, its no way to live and I need help asap. How do you maintain a good sex life in a longterm relationship? How do you keep the sexual desire alive where intimacy is consistent?\n",

      "Body text: Background: I (27F) have been in a relationship with my partner (29M) since August 2024. It definitely started out as a rebound for me, as I’d just gotten out of a year long relationship. From August 2024 to about December 2024, we were just exclusively hooking up. It was only since the start of 2025 that things got quite romantic and we are now definitely together and enjoying being together. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far, it has been really great. He’s a bit more introverted, so we spend lots of time at his place, cooking, chatting and watching our shows. He takes me out on really cute thoughtful dates too. We feel very comfortable in each other’s presence. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 3 months, I have been unemployed. I have spent a lot of time applying (unsuccessfully!) and this has taken a huge knock on my self-esteem. My partner has been incredibly supportive throughout. I’ve been in a bit of a depressive slump and this has affected most parts of my life (not sleeping / eating well, lack of exercise etc)- most relevant to this sub, is that it has impacted my relationship. I’m not as engaged, energetic, and upbeat as I once was. Our sex life has significantly slowed down too. My partner has never once been unkind about this, but I know that my mood shift has affected him. \n",
      "\n",
      "My job prospects are not looking great (I’m currently working part time for family so I still have some money but it’s not ideal). I really need some advice on how to improve my mood and get myself back on track, for myself, and also to be a better partner. Please comment if you can relate or if you have some advice :)\n",

      "Title: I (27f) am feeling overwhelming anxiety after getting back together with my boyfriend (28m)\n",
      "Body text: So me and my bf have been having problems for some time now, the last few months have specifically been really bad. Fighting constantly, needing space from each other only to come back and fight again, etc. We talked about doing couples therapy but then life happened and my insurance was weird, so that took the backseat for a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 weeks ago I hit my breaking point, and I broke up with him with little explanation after a fight. I immediately regretted it and came back 15 minutes later crying, asking for him to forgive me. He understandably needed space, and we talked a few days later. During that conversation, he said he needed a break/a breakup. We talked for a while, and I said I really didn't want to but I understood where he was coming from and call me in the fall if he changes his mind (Whatever, not the best choice, I know).\n",
      "\n",
      "For about 5 days, we're broken up. And honestly? I felt kinda good. Not anxious, not constantly worried about this other person, fighting with someone else all the time, it was kind of nice. However, then he texts me, asking me to talk. Saying this has been the worst week of his life, he's sorry, he was speaking out of anger and selfishness.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked and he said he agreed the relationship wasn't working, we both are so sick of fighting constantly and being constantly miserable, but we both felt like (at different times this week) we really wanted to try and work it out and do everything we could. So, he proposed going to couples therapy and making a commitment for 6 months that we would work really hard and try really hard to make it work, and if after 6 months nothing was improving, we could part knowing we did all we could.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan seemed like a great idea. He offered me space and time to think about it, but I just said yes, probably impulsively. In the days since then, we've had a really good time hanging out and we had a consultation with a therapist that we're going to start working with who seems to understand the situation adn think we can work it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can't shake this feeling that I made a mistake and I regret getting back together. Ever since we got back together I've been incredibly anxious about jumping back into something that doesn't work--about being miserable for another 6 months of my life and having to pretend things are ok, about having to tell my friends and family who saw how much this relationship was draining me that I'm actually jumping back in and trying again. My gut is telling me that this maybe isn't a great idea and the uncertainty is killing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if the uncertainty is the thing killing me, it seems like at least giving it a go to try and fix it and having my relationship status be stable for at least a little bit might be a good idea. And clearly he's trying and committed to trying to make this better.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back together, I made a promise that I would uphold my end of the commitment, and I know that going back on that would be extremely hurtful and something that we could never come back from. THerefore, part of me wonders if it's worth it to just try therapy and see if we can make it work. However, I can't help but feel in my gut that my heart is not in it and every day that I get further into this the more overwhelmed and trapped I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure if the best move is to try to talk to him about all of this or just suck it up or just break it off. We love each other a lot, and I don't want to hurt him, but I don't want to lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; After a period of turbulence, me and my boyfriend decided our relationship wasn't working and he broke up with me. He then reached out to me expressing how committed he was to working on our relationship, and I also felt that way so we got back together, but now I'm having doubts.\n",

      "Title: 24M Dealing with 22F GF’s Family and Moving\n",
      "Body text: I am 24M.  My girlfriend is 22F.  We have been “officially” dating 2 years this month (although we were dating as soon as we met each other, just never said it, but we knew).\n",
      "\n",
      "I currently live at home with my parents, and I’m saving money to move out.  She lives between her parent’s house and an apartment with her brother which are both 15/20 minutes from where I live.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We have been dating for almost 2 years now and I have had completely minimal contact with her parents/family in general.  Part of that is my fault for not introducing myself the first night I took her out on a date and ever since.  At the same time, they have not really gone out of their way to see me either, and my gf has not really pushed for me to meet them.  So many months go by, we’re still dating, and the most I’ve ever done is say “hi” and shake hands in their driveway when I would come to pick her up.  So they really don’t know me at all.  \n",
      "Meanwhile, my gf has told me all about them throughout the months.  Not gonna pull any punches here…her family is dysfunctional.  She tells me all about how her Mom is a complete narcissist.  Her Dad is more reasonable, but he’s sexually attracted to my gf (his own blood daughter btw).  They abuse my gf by always belitting her, making her do chores, giving her more responsibility than any of her older siblings, making her pay rent/bills while others don’t (the parents don’t need the money whatsoever), always expecting more of her, not respecting her privacy, sometimes physical violence, silent treatment from the Mom, etc. etc.  She is basically the Cinderalla of the house.  So all the while I hear about how bad her family is.  I don’t want to meet them at all the more I learn about them.  They sound crazy from the outside looking in.  But my gf is infinitely sweet, and it really makes no sense how she is the way she is, given that environment.  I love her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, one day, over a year into our relationship, we set up a night for me to come over for dinner to really meet her parents and brother/sister.  I am dreading it.  The night before I drank with some of my friends (probably subconsciously sabotaging myself on purpose).  I was extremely hungover all the next day.  I told my gf to tell her family I was very sorry, I don’t want to be sitting down for dinner giving them a real first impression while I’m miserably hungover, and if we could do this dinner on any other night that I would be more than willing to.  I was very apologetic, I genuinely felt bad, and I knew it was a stupid mistake.  I had embarassed my gf because she thought that I was gonna come and they would finally be able to meet me, and I was basically cancelling the day of, after it’d been planned a few days prior.  I felt like a total idiot.  \n",
      "So the whole night at dinner, her family is shit talking me, joking her, talking complete crap about me and her, etc etc and she just has to listen to it, alone.  She was, understandably, extremely disappointed.  She then tells me that her family is no longer interested in inviting me over anymore, I’m no longer welcome, and I will not be receiving any more invites to dinner.  I guess no second chances, right ?  I know I’d made a mistake, but to admit it, apologize, and then not be given even a chance seems unreasonable.  Her family, I’ve learned, is not reasonable.\n",
      "Time goes by.  We’re still dating.  Ever since I missed that dinner, I’ve had no in-person interactions with her family besides occassionally seeing her brother in their apartment.  As time goes by, her family begins building a resentment/grudge towards me for no real reason.  They think she should break up with me.  My gf had been going through some clinical mental issues at the time that were inherited and completely unrelated to me.  They blamed it on me.  They thought I was causing her mental anguish, they thought I was the reason she was getting depressed, etc etc.  Relationship-wise the two of us were doing fine, though.  We had hiccups here and there like any couple would, but I knew and she knew that I was not causing the problems she was suffering from mentally.  It required medication.  \n",
      "Their perception of me had gotten so bad, that they told her we had to break up.  We love each other, and she did not want to do that.  So she basically told them that we did break up, and we’ve been seeing each other in secret for the past couple months or so.  \n",
      "But before it got that bad, she’s told me they wouldn’t even open the door for me to talk to them in person.  I told her she has to try to convince them to at least have a dialogue with me about dating their daughter.  She tells me every time she brings it up they don’t want to hear it.  They get angry, they yell at her, they tell her to drop the subject.  They literally will not speak with me about it, and they will not listen to her, no matter what she says.  It got so bad to the point where they told her that if she continues to date me, she will be cutoff from the family.  They’ll take away any payments they help her with.  They’ll take her out of the inheritence, no holidays, no contact.  Just out of their lives.  Which is a totally reasonable thing to tell your daughter that you “love,” right ?\n",
      "So she is faced with the dilemma of basically choosing between me or her family.  She loves her family unconditionally (for better or worse), and she loves me the same way.  So in the meantime, we have been dating in secret while we try to figure a solution.\n",
      "I asked my parents.  They told me that it’s an all around bad situation.  They love my gf and think she’s great, but that her family is not great.  That I would be putting myself in for a world of hurt by continuing down a path with her and trying to ever get in the good graces of her crazy family.  To some extent, I agree, but I love her and I feel like I should be able to have a life with her and just have her family be separate and only have contact when needed.  The thing is, I’m really not a bad guy, and I think they would learn to not hate me if they actually knew who I was, but they don’t care to learn.  I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now her family wants her to move to a different state,  get a new job or two, and pay rent in a condo they have paid off while she also goes to a new school.  (She has already graduated college, so I’m not exactly sure why they want her to do more school.)  She is planned to make this move in mid June.  It is May 12th, 2025 as of this writing.  So we probably have about a month.  She wants me to move to this new state with her, and live in her condo with her in secret.  Meanwhile, if her family ever came to visit, I’d have to hide all of my belongings and stay somewhere else while they’re there.  Which I think is completely unreasonable, and I have no ties to anyone in the new state we’d be in.  I’d also have to acquire a new job, and we’d both be living on our own for the first time, in secret.  Like I couldn’t even be in the background while she’s on the phone with them.\n",
      "So she wants me to move with her.  I’m telling her it’s a bad deal for me.  Her parents would inevitably find out and probably make her end it with me anyways.  I don’t think long distance ever works.  And I don’t know how to start any meaningful dialogue with her parents to prevent any of this, or get their blessing to stay with her.\n",
      "TL;DR So in conclusion…my gf’s family hates me, she is moving out of state and wants me to move with her and live in secret from her parents while upending my current job/life where I live now.  \n",
      "I am looking for any reasonable solutions or any advice whatsoever in such a complicated situation.\n",
      "It would be horrible to end our relationship just because of some outside factors that have nothing to do with how we feel about each other.\n",

      "Title: I Think My Gf’s Best Childhood Friend Loves Her\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "My gf, Mary (30F) and I (27F) have been dating for about 10 months. It’s been incredible in every way and I finally feel I’ve found my person. We’ve traveled abroad together already, spent the holidays together, and have met each others families. We plan to move in together around the 1 1/2 year mark. We have had only one fight and typically have amazing communication if something needs to be expressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one fight we have had is a current continued one , revolving around her childhood best friend, Rich (30M). Rich is a pretty socially awkward guy but overall still a nice person from most of the interactions I’ve had with him. They’ve been friends since middle school and have been through a lot of trauma together. Long before we met, Mary and Rich would hang out 2-3 time a a week. Then about a year before we met, Mary got upset at him because he was being a bad friend and they were seeing each other significantly less. She even prefers to see him with me there as a buffer. Now, Mary, Rich and I usually hang out all together.  There have been a few moments where I feel Rich is in Love with Mary. I think that from the below moments and my intuition on having experienced a good guy friend liking me in the past, when I didn’t realize. \n",
      "\n",
      "- on her 30th surprise birthday he brought her a huge bouquet of flowers. When I was setting up and he gave them to me he mentioned “he felt bad because it should be the partner to bring the flowers, but they were so beautiful so he couldn’t help himself” I thought It was a weird comment and put them with the rest of the gifts. \n",
      "- whenever we hang out as us three he will hang onto her every word. If she bends over or walks away his eyes usually follow her and I’ve caught Rich checking her out. \n",
      "- Always makes comments about how when Mary, Mary’s teenage nephew, and Rich used to go out. They get mistaken for a family and her nephew is their son. \n",
      "- he texts me looking to buy expensive gifts for Mary, but then tells us in person that he can’t afford expensive gifts for his Girlfriend and that they are having problems. \n",
      "-Rich confessed he liked Mary long ago in college (unsure on the full timing) she turned him down and they moved on as she continued to come out and date more women. She still likes both men and women. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I tried to bring this all up and frame it that I am feeling uncomfortable because of points a,b and c. Mary got so defensive saying that I need to trust her and she would know or realize if Rich had feelings for her all these years. I was dead wrong in my perspective. She seemingly invalidated my experiences and perspective. I tried to drop it over the course of a few weeks until we hung out again recently. \n",
      "\n",
      "This last time it was evident to me that Rich was checking out my girlfriend and it upset me. He continued to check her out when she turned around and kept begging her to come over to help him with something. Once he left I brought it up again that I was not comfortable. She was extremely defensive and upset with me again. She claims I continue to “not trust her perspective and judgement” and I’m being “crazy to think he would ever like her”. Mary always believes Rich is an awkward nice guy and that’s why I feel weird about him. She also mentioned she put a boundary up to only see him once a month to make me feel more Comfortable since the last time we spoke. However she never voiced this to me until in this fight so I have no idea how the boundary was put in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mary continues to say that I am being controlling about this situation and it isn’t sitting well with her. I should add she has other straight guy friends, queer friends, and other lesbians around that I’ve met and she hangs out with alone. I encourage her to go out with her friends alone. I have no problem with this and we have no fights about it. I only have voiced how I feel discomfort around rich and think he has romantic feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I don’t even want to ever be around Rich again as it causes so much tension every time. I know I can’t say that as that is controlling to ask someone to cut a friend of 20 years off or say I’ll never be around him again. I’m missing a lot of background of their friendship and I get that. \n",
      "\n",
      "To meet in the middle I mentioned having him over every other month when we live together or hanging out as two couples. She did not like the timing idea as she felt her boundary she put in place was enough. Mary didn’t want to see him less as he is depressed and “going through it”, and I was being controlling. Mary says she also reached out to Rich to double date, but his gf is always busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure what to do at this point without her getting so defensive or another huge fight coming up. Im tired. Am I missing something in this situation? Do you think that I am being controlling of the friendship to ask to see him even less than the boundary she already put in place in our home? I don’t want to feel uncomfortable in our shared home and what is supposed to be our safe space. (Hanging out outside is not really an option as Rich is always going through it and can’t be outside at a park or can’t afford to go grab dinner) What would you do to come to a solution with your partner so you both feel good about this? Will it just sort itself out because he’s also a bad friend?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; My girlfriend strongly feels her good childhood friend does not have feelings for her. I feel he has strong romantic feelings and it makes me uncomfortable to have him around. How do we move forward that’s best for the both of us without the continued fight?\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been in a relationship f(21) with my boyfriend m(22) for over two years now. Our relationship is a bit sticky because of his parents (a long history of them being mean and refusing to get to know me but deciding to dislike me). We have had countless arguments about it mostly me being insecure and upset but he always did take my side it just yk it’s my fair. Afar from that, I only try to focus on us two. But I just feel like I haven’t been feeling much love from him. Our love languages are pretty different. Mine is words of affirmation and quality time whereas his is mostly gifts. I feel loved through talking or written out words, and quality time. We always had a small distance between us making phone calls and video chats the easiest way to see each other. But during those calls, he’s always ALWAYS too busy doing something else. Whether it’s gaming, phone games, or even j on Reddit, he can’t just give me at least five minutes of listening or looking at each other and being attentive. I fully understand that he wants to do other things while on call, and I’m not trying to make him not do that either. I’m just at least wanting a short time of at least eye contact and engaging in our conversations bc for me when he wants to call, I don’t do anything else to give him the full attention, yet he ends up missing what I say the entire time. Idk if I’m being the crazy one but I just want to feel reciprocated with the amount of love I give to him. And when I try to communicate that to him, he just gets so defensive or upset then becomes avoidant. I don’t focus on buying expensive gifts like he does but I do it through words. I’ve been sending him emails with love letters in them for over two years now, wishing he’d write me one. Idk. I honestly feel like 2 years is still an early stage of a relationship where showing affection is necessary, but to him he just brushes it off saying he’s to lazy or we’ve been together long enough. So I only get the full affection in the first year but that’s it?\n",

      "Title: My (24F) dad (53M) blocked me on Facebook and Instagram. Is it worth it to confront him about it?\n",
      "Body text: Long story short, my dad and I reconnected in 2023 after 10 years of no contact. We have a very complicated relationship and it is, unfortunately, mainly one-sided. I am mainly the one who asks to come over to his house, plan dinners, ask how he is doing, while he only sends me texts on special occasions and asks if I need money. He lives with his wife and my little step-brother. He puts all of his energy and focus into my little brother and is committed to training him in wrestling. This dynamic has left me feeling very disconnected from their family and like an outsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never asked them for any help until recently. A few weeks ago I was nearing homelessness and asked if I could stay at their house just for a couple months until I start a new lease in the summer. They reassured me that it was fine and that I could stay as long as I wanted so I moved in over the weekend. A day after I moved in, my dad texted me saying there was an issue with their housing agreement and that having an extra person living in their home would be in violation of their agreement. He then told me that I had to pick up all my stuff the next day, didn't ask where I would be living next, and said if I needed money I could text him. I declined his offer for money and figured out my living situation on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just last week and I haven't heard anything from them since I left. I decided to check my dad's Facebook because I look through it occasionally and found out he blocked me as well as on Instagram. I am very confused because I did nothing for the day that I was at his place besides move my stuff and go to sleep. Maybe he feels guilty about his decision or has decided he wants nothing to do with me anymore? However, he hasn't blocked my phone number. I am thinking of texting him and asking why he blocked me but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I was also maybe thinking of texting his wife instead since she is a lot more parental than he is and feel like she would be more inclined to tell me what happened. I'm not sure what the right decision is. I did look forward to at least having a relationship with my little brother but I don't know how to navigate that if my dad wants to possibly cut contact. Any advice would be appreciated and I am open to answer any questions!\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - My dad blocked me on social media shortly after I moved out of his house. I don't know if I should confront him or not. I am confused if this is a sign that he feels guilty or that he does not want me part of his life anymore. He has not blocked my number so I can still text him.\n",

When we first got together, things were really good and we had sex a lot. Naturally, our sex life had taken a back seat due to working, moving, and just being busy. My anxiety had flared up big time, and now I’m in my head a lot about this. \n",

      "This will get TMI fast, I apologize.\n",

      "In the beginning, I made it clear I don’t feel comfortable when we have sex and it’s just me receiving anything. Due to past trauma, it makes me feel absolutely terrible when I’m the only one receiving physical acts. She knows this and I’ve worked on this a lot, so we can on occasion have this kind of sex. She can be a stone top sometimes, and isn’t in the mood to be touched all the time (valid) so we don’t have this type of sex unless we are both comfortable. \n",

It makes me feel like she’s only doing it since I asked and I feel guilty. But she’s made it so clear that is untrue, and she really enjoys sex with me no matter what, and she would say no if she didn’t want it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the actual problem…. She’s the best, most patient person with me and my anxiety, I love her so much but I’m so frustrated with her right now. She has brought up maybe exploring kinks to see if we can get over my anxiety and bring me out of my head. I love the idea and asked her what she would like to try but she’s leaving it up to me. She has her hard no’s, but is making me choose something to start with. I am so far removed from the kink world that I don’t know what I would like and not like. She has experience as a bdsm dom, so I was hoping she would give me some directions. \n",

      "The problem is, I can’t get over the thought that whatever I choose and ask for, she won’t be into and then I’m not interested in it. She isn’t necessarily into anything, but says she will work with whatever I wanna try. But I’m only wanting to try what she wants. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like we’re going around in circles and it’s making me upset and frustrated. She won’t even give me a list of stuff she would even be slightly into. And then her saying she’s not interested in anything, makes me not want to do anything since I’ll feel guilty. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know I’m an anxious person, I’ve been to therapy for it and I’m working on it all the time, but I’ve never had it affect me like this with such an intimate situation. Should I just suck it up, and stop being a baby about this? \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been in a **very** happy, emotionally affirming relationship for almost a year. He's been incredibly caring, good at verbalizing affection, giving me gifts, and just in general has been a good, attentive boyfriend that is willing to talk things through.   \n",

      "\n",
      "I realized he’s great at expressing all his *positive* emotions, but when it comes to confrontation or processing *negative* stuff, he just shuts down. The actual argument started because he said a “joke” over text that really crossed a line. I told him how it hurt me, and while he *did* apologize, his responses gave off “let’s just move on” energy. He was also taking 30 mins to an hour to respond while I was trying to actually talk it through.\n",
      "\n",
      "This avoidant behavior kept up until we finally called the next day. He was really defensive at first, until he admitted that he’s just “not good at articulating himself” and his first instinct was to not think about things at all. I had a long convo with him about how we can’t just push emotionally heavy stuff aside. I also told him that sometimes it feels like he treats me like a “guy friend” as we both have more traditionally masculine hobbies and that he needs to start recognizing the difference between me being his best friend and me being his *partner* when we’re having disagreements.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "After we gave each other some room and called again I ended up fully forgiving him as I did see a change in his behavior where he was more considerate/gentle towards me + seemed truly apologetic. Later into the night we talked about our home lives for a while as we have similar experiences. Throughout the conversation he said things like \"he's just learned to not linger too much on it\" and how this carries over to other parts of his life. ie. how he doesn't really tell his friends really anything about things that bother him (unrelated to his home life).   \n",
      "  \n",
      "We had this moment where I said something like, “I’ve been in therapy for 3 years, and I’ve genuinely learned to love myself.” And he responded with “I don’t really like myself.” I asked him if he wanted to explain why, and he just said “not really.”\n",

      "Title: My roommates (20F and 22F) are horrible and I am about to move out\n",
      "Body text: Hello, the past year I lived with four other girls, two of which I love, the other two, who are sisters, are simply awful. The younger one is extremely confrontational, petty, selfish, and acts like she is the only person in the house. She will leave molding dishes for weeks and weeks, take up the fridge space with massive Tupperware that gets moldy, throw other people’s things out, eat other people’s food, broke the blinds and refused to replace them, and does not take accountability for anything. The older one supports her sister and acts like everyone else is the issue when it comes to dishes, messes, replacing damages, etc. She also has let her bf live at our place and refuses to acknowledge that for months, while he uses utilities and is always in our spaces. They regularly talk shit about me, because I’m the new tenant (all I have done is ask nicely for clean dishes in a group chat without pointing fingers, and then also ask nicely that rent be paid on time, as $50 of late fees landed on me and she does not take accountability).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their force together, with their combined pettiness, lack of accountability, and inconsideration, has made living here hell. My other roommate, my friend, who had known them longer, got in a one-sided dispute with the younger one, which has caused my friend to want to move out. About an hour ago the older sister just yelled at my friend for MINUTES in front of everyone, calling her immature, and saying the dispute was her fault and they did her a favor “letting her live with them” and that she owes them that. It was really hard to listen to.\n",

      "Anyways, as my friend and I both plan to move out, I am wondering what I can do to get some sort of revenge as I leave. Is there anything subtle I can do to the place? Also the younger one drives and does not have a license so I’m wondering if there is anything that I can do about that as well. I have been nothing but nice, a people-pleaser, and so tolerant of this.\n",

      "Hi,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for two and a half years. Like any couple, we’ve had our ups and downs, but things have generally been good. Our relationship is somewhat long-distance due to cultural and traditional reasons—we live in different cities, though not far apart.\n",

      "\n",
      "Two months ago, her workplace hired a new head manager. As usual, she shared stories involving him, and from what I could gather, he seemed like a typical smooth-talker—overly nice in a way that didn’t feel genuine. Over time, their interactions became the centerpiece of her stories. Their jokes and conversations became more personal—not sexual, but intimate enough to make me uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",

      "About a week ago, she was fired from her job. She became withdrawn, stopped answering my calls, and only responded through text. I offered to visit her and take her out to help her feel better—not for my sake, but hers. She refused, saying she was too depressed.\n",

      "Body text: TLDR: I’ve (29F) been with my bf (29M) for over a decade. I think trauma is causing us to drift apart, and while I’ve tried to get him help, I think it’s causing me to resent him. I don’t think he’s can be the partner I need and it terrifies me.\n",

      "I’ve (29F) been dating my bf (29F) since high school. For years, our love was magical. Full of lust, passion, laughs, and great memories. Since we’ve known each other for years, we’ve experienced a lot together. That includes trauma. He lost a parent at a young age (15) and I always feared it would come back to haunt him later on. He tried therapy but never truly healed his wounds. He then went years without therapy. Fast forward to graduating college, I feel like I was living my best life and thriving with my career and experiencing new cities.. while he was just there and along for the ride. At times, I felt like he wasnt in reality. Idk if that makes sense. Like he almost refused to grow up internally. He has always treated me with respect and love but when it came to doing *adult things (like looking ahead to the future or financial planning or career planning or planning in general), he just couldn’t. For years this has been slowly drawing me away from him. But I still love him so much and care deeply for him and he does for me. He tells me that I’m his biggest motivator. And yes, I’ve always pushed him to be proactive and do the best he can do. Becuase in my eyes he has so much potential. I know what he is capable of because I knew him before the trauma, but part of me is thinking he may be stuck and may not be capable to get there and it scares me sm. \n",

      "Recently we  moved to a new city. It was a shaky time for us. I was excited but he was a little nervous and really wants to settle but unsure if this city is the right place for him. Something set in for him and myself though after we moved. I pretty much forced him to go to therapy and start feeling his emotions again. He did. He’s made improvements and it makes me so happy but it feels like it’s too late for me. I don’t want it to be. I’ve tried to get him to work on himself for years and he’s always pushed back and never wanted to face reality. Now that he’s finally doing it, it weirdly makes me feel soooo distant, disconnected, and almost resentful. It’s almost like I just wanted to make sure he got the help he needs so I can move on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I feel like all my family and friends are worried for me because our relationship has a slow burn now. I can see it in their eyes and wondering “what’s next?” Or “something needs to change”. So sometimes when we’re out, I get pretty annoyed by my BF. Pretty much everything he does. From eating, talking, and coughing. The resentment is in full force. \n",
      "\n",
      "  It’s so hard for me to write this becuase deep down I believe he’s my soul mate, but the cards he’s been dealt in life are pushing him away from me. Again, he’s working on himself but I’m at the age where I need to make a decision. It feels too late for me.  unfortunately it comes at the cost of losing my best friend and love of my life. The timing sucks. \n",

      "Body text: TLDR: I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years. I made mistakes early on, and even though we both grew, I’m still treated like I’m always the problem. We’ve lost emotional and physical intimacy, and I feel distant and unfulfilled. I miss my friends and wonder if I’m settling. Sometimes things feel good again, but it doesn’t last.

That really hurt. I confronted her, and although we talked it through, that was probably the moment I started feeling differently.

      "For one, physical affection is really important to me, and she’s not into it much. She doesn’t say a lot of loving things, and we haven’t been intimate in about 6 months not even making out.

      "Title: Please give me advice\n",
      "Body text: This is the situation I am in. These are the people involved. my partner (19M) and I (19F) have been dating for almost 2 years. through the 2 years we have obviously had our fights, our breaks, and struggles. \n",
      "Here is some context: \n",
      "My birthday is coming up in June, His birthday is a couple months after mine. Last year for my birthday we went on a quick family trip for 2 days for my birthday, he was included. He didn’t get me anything for my birthday, not even paying for my food when we went to the trip for my birthday. (not that it’s expected but it would have been nice) and i also gave him time to save up for my birthday just incase he did want to buy me something. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got him a Record player, and some vinyls, some new shoes and gadgets. My love language is gift giving, so I always buy him gifts just because. I have expressed my feelings to him about this, and have told him i’d even prefer a letter from him literally ANYTHING. He had given me some letters but only really when I keep bothering him to write me them. He buys me flowers, and pays for our food when we go out to eat but that’s it. I buy our concert tickets, I buy him anything he wants but he never does it in return. \n",
      "now it’s almost my birthday AGAIN. and i’ve told him to save up and that I wanted a KitchenAid mixer, or some new shoes, maybe a bracelet or necklace, maybe a promise ring. ( which we’ve talked about and he gives me false hope that he will buy me a promise ring but he never has.)  I’ve given him many options and he knows what i like.  \n",
      "I’m just waiting to see if he gets me anything on my birthday, or seeing if he makes up excuses saying why he doesn’t have enough money, or that he knows the item is not going to arrive on time, or simply that I don’t deserve the items for my birthday. He has said all these excuses to me in the past. \n",
      "long story short what do i even do, i love him dearly but it just feels like my wants and needs are being put to the side. I’m not a very materialistic person but It would be nice to receive a gift here and then or like i stated simply just a hand written letter would be nice. \n",
      "All of my friends are saying Im just settling for the bare minimum, but it’s a very hard situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still want to be with him , what should i do with him? talk it out more? TL;DR My situation is very tricky, but i still want to remain together. \n",

      "Title: Bf (M29) told me (F25) a year and a half in that he is not sure he is in love, hasn't felt the spark.\n",
      "Body text: My bf 29M has never been incredibly romantic with me 25F in our 1.5 relationship. When we first started dating he told me he was in such poor timing with work and being kicked out of his apartment and said he didn't like me THAT MUCH but he said we had known each other for two months and we needed to get to know each other more but that he knew for sure he wanted to be with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agreed since I also felt the same way, I liked him a lot but not crazy and blind, liked him to date and was excited about it. We started dating afterwards and my feelings def grew, I fell in love with him, I assumed he did too. But since he wasn't as romantic I eventually had the conversation and it fell into a: I am not romantic because I don't feel that, it doesn't come to me naturally because it's not in my heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said that he has never been this cold in a relationship and thinks it has to do with his master's degree, two jobs and terrible housing situation. He said that in other relationships he was way more romantic and drunkish in love. I was petrified. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if we was in love with me? And he said \"I can't say that. I've had my doubts about my feelings towards you, I love you and I like you a lot and I want to be with you, but I can't for certain say I'm in love with you\". He again, said that he's never been this stressed in his life and that I caught him at such at a bad time and that he believes this is why he hasn't felt it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He begged for me to wait together until his degree \n",
      "and his two jobs were gone so we could spend more time together and his mind could be more free but I couldn't bare the pain of knowing my boyfriend was not fully convinced about what he felt towards me, since it was already bringing me pain and insecurity. He claimed that the \"in love\" part wasn't needed since it was a chemical reaction and that he chose to be with me because he wanted me in his life and that was even more powerful and stronger but I called bs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked about previous relationships and he said that his \"in love\" levels have diminished as years go and that other dates before me didn't convince him but I made the cut, enough for him to try again. He then went to say that he wished and would want me badly to be the one but can't feel the spark that he's felt before. I def feel a spark for him and I've felt like I've been patient enough and I've convinced myself that his feelings will not spark the night he gets his diploma. \n",
      "\n",
      "We finished the conversation with me trying to lighten it for him saying that others will come and he said they will not be the same, not me. And I said well you might actually fall in love and said: don't know. I keep reading where love takes work and that sometimes all those chemicals indeed go away but I also know the importance of feeling loved that way and how fulfilling it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, I so desperately want him. I genuinely thought he was the one and it pains me to know he wants me to be the one but is unsure about his feelings. I'm trying to find what's best. How should we navigate this? \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: boyfriend said that he hasn't felt the spark or being in love with me and we have been dating for a year and a half. He claims it's stress, since he's never been this stressed in his life and wants to stay together to see if those develop once his life improves. He believes choosing to be with me is stronger than being in love with me while I think love means feelings and choice. How should we take this on? \n",

      "Body text: I m23 have been with my boyfriend m23 for about 8 months now. He’s just moved out of state in hopes to make more money so i can move with him and last weekend i had it all hit at once. The fear, the doubt and the pit in my stomach just came in and burrowed deep. Ive never had a doubt until that weekend which he was working long hours and i just hardly heard anything from him. \n",

      "I wanted to hear how is new job was going, how he’s liking it there and just anything but he was busy and tired. I crashed out after a couple days of sitting in my thoughts alone and i fear I’ve put us in a position where things are just awkward now. We’ve never had an issue where we couldn’t have a normal conversation about it but i was just angry and scared and couldn’t hold it in. Since then, I’ve checked everything every day every minute, location, following, when he’s out of the house i just can’t even sleep. \n",

      "The worry that now that he’s seen this side of me that he won’t anything to do with me and will just find someone new and exciting before i can even get up there. Ive been cheated on every relationship prior, and he knows this himself. I told him from the beginning i never want to be this overbearing boyfriend who distrusts everything and thinks he’s going to just get one over on me but i feel it creeping back in. I love this man, he has truly brought out so much life from me that i never knew that i had and i don’t want to ruin things for us just because I’ve been burned before. TLDR, how does anyone get over past instances with cheating and continue forward in a relationship healthily?\n",

      "Body text: TLDR: The title pretty much sums it up. 18 months in and I'm starting to feel more comfortable whereas she still desires a spark. She talks about it in a way that makes it seem like a dealbreaker, like it's something we just feel fundamentally different about, I'm trying to look for compromises.\n",

      "My and girlfriend have been in an online-relationship for 18 months. Recently, a little mishap happened that got us to discuss the aforementioned question. A quick recap of the events:\n",
      "\n",
      "She was doing her makeup on videocall. As I am but a simple man I asked some questions about what she's doing and what all the makeup is for, however what I never mentioned was any type of compliment on her looks. Then she asked me \"are you going to complement me?\", to which I just laughed as I thought she was being silly, but she was actually genuinely upset that I didn't compliment her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wasn't just a one time thing, this conversation has been brought up multiple times about our seemingly never aligned expectations from one another specifically when it comes to compliments or verbal affection. I do give her compliments and have been improving with that as well, she would also acknowledge that, yet it still seems that either I am lacking or that she is expecting too much when it comes to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing she brought up that I thought was interesting is that she had a 4 year relationship that lasted from when she was 18-22 where this 'spark' she had never seemed to dissipate throughout the entire relationship. They were as lovey-dovey when they started as when things took an unfortunate turn causing them to break up. It's making me think that perhaps we are just fundamentally different in what we expect, but at the same time I can't help but feel she's seeing things through rose-tinted glasses. Perhaps the spark in her previous relationship stayed because of how young she was? I don't know. I'm not a professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to come into this as open-minded as possible. She just thinks that 'that's how she is and that's how I am', like two paths that will never cross, I'm willing to believe that there is some way to find a compromise or solution of sorts. I hope it goes without saying that I still love her and think she's amazing, but I do guess that I'm also just starting to feel comfortable enough to be a little more casual around her.\n",

      "Title: Desperation\n",
      "Body text: I [18M] have been almost a month with my partner [18F]. Before we started officially dating, we've been already acting like in a relationship. Everything's going fine between us, and the only two obstacles so far have been \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Her parents, which put her in misogynistic situations on what she should do or what not (even though they do not actually control her). This makes her feel ashamed sometimes for things she shouldn't and also prevent her from meeting me, she feels awful sometimes because the sitution her parents put her into. But I'm not focusing on that rn. Also, our sexual life is going great for both of us whether her parents complain or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. My past trauma. Feelings of guilt, fear of abandonment, derrealization, depression... I've been working for years on all this stuff, and I work all of this on my own. I'm not trying to build emotional dependency on her, and she's really aware of my situations too. So it's just that I'm struggling to get out of trauma and finally writing a positive narrative for my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before her, I only had one boyfriend. He left me as soon as depression (which appeared to prevent me from feeling loved or happy, as a coping mechanism) came back, he didn't want to be around someone like me I guess. Then after that, I was in love with another girl for a long time and everything was awful. She ghosted me constantly, but then on parties we were really affectionate. But it wasn't a good thing, because then we wouldn't see each other for some time and wouldn't even write me. She was basically using me (whether she noticed or not) for emotional support or comfort, when I was really, really in love with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what I'm trying to say here, is that I've had a rough childhood and also really bad romantic and sexual scenarios with some people before my actual gf. She's amazing, caring for me, attentive, fun to be with and we're getting both satisfied overall. But since I started liking her, I've been fighting against my own mind constantly so I don't stop loving her (referring to emotional numbness), fall on past guilt, anxiety of her not really liking me, and a lot of other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all of those, I knew that what  I had to do (which has ben working) was ignore some insecurities and rationalize others, but anyway NOT stopping to meet her; that's a way of telling your mind \"yes, the best thing is to prevent her from hurting you\". And well, I'm glad I haven't stopped meeting her, because everything besides those problems have been going realy great.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yesterday a new feature - which I actually know from past experiences - kicked in. 'The desperate need to be with her', and that doesn't feel right. One thing is to want to spend time with someone, another one is feeling afraid of not being with her. For more context, she went on a plan with her family and I couldn't go, and that's rationally fine but my anxiety was just like 'you're missing something important', and the thought of her was like 'I really want to be with her, and I should'. All of this from an anxious point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get that I don't need to feel like that, because it comes from fear of abandonment, and while it always is a possibility I don't need to focus on that because it's not healthy. Today we're meeting, and not because I thought yesterday 'we should meet right now, the first momen we can'. I just told her to go out because I thought it was a good thing, and to keep the relationship going. It's not a bad thing but, here's the question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm afraid to strengthen the anxiety by meeting her. I don't want that desperation because it's not realistic and comes from past experiences, I just want to meet her nicely as we've been doing and let this old pattern go. Does this sound healthy? :\n",
      "Planning things with her besides anxiety or depression giving me false signs? Like, acting out how I really want and not how these emotions tell me to? This will lower them overtime, but for when this anxiety comes in (or even if it happens when I'm with her) is it okay to be with her? Or am I strengthening it?\n",
      "\n",
      "What sounds right to me is to work this anxiety if it comes back when I'm not with her, instead of feeding it? Maybe I'm just overthinking it and it was like a residual thing and won't come by again? Because as I said, rationally I'm not like \"shit, I really have to be with her or else what am I gonna do?\", is just a random emotion. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "[18M] Desperation for spending time with my partner [18F] coming from anxiety due to past trauma and awful romantic experiences. I'm not desperate on a rational level, and this is not a common emotion for me (for the month we've been as partners). It's something I notice that comes from the past and that has nothing to do with my new relationship. Do I just ignore this emotion or do I have to do something with it to not feed it on the long term? Because meeting her out of love is not a bad thing, but from anxiety it is, and I can't control sometimes if I feel anxious or not. Is it better to not meet her if I'm anxious? On your experience what sounds best?\n",

      "Body text: We have been together for almost a year. We are long distance, he lives in France, I live in Italy. I actually really care for him, and I like him a lot, and I know that I love him. We are in a really healthy relationship. We really don’t have any kind of problem. We see each other once a month for 5 days, I go there or he comes here; the rest of the time we FaceTime and we live our lives. Now, there is one thing that really bothers me in the relationship… I am a really thoughtful person, I like making presents, showing my love by remembering the little things, baking, writing poetry… he doesn’t. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that he is at fault for this, because he has ways of showing me love, and I feel loved, but sometimes I really wish that somebody would treat me like a princess. I will make an example I love flowers, I buy them for myself, and everyone knows how much I appreciate a bouquet. He never gifted me flowers The first months I tried to be subtle, by hinting at it, but the last 4 months I straight up asked for flowers and he never did. And I know that it doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I just cannot comprehend how a person that says to love you, wouldn’t put a little effort in something so little. And no, I don’t pretend gifts all the time, but I would like my little attentions reciprocated. You could also grab some flowers from the park (said it directly to him multiple times) I don’t resent him for this, I think that he is a wonderful guy, and I understand that not everyone shows love the same way, but it’s been a year know and yes, I may sound really silly, but I does make my sad that I’m never going to wake up with breakfast ready, ora have flowers in a vase when I come home. So maybe I should leave, but not because I think he is an idiot, I love him, but because maybe his way of loving is not mine. Because it’s a stupid flower today, but it shows lack of consideration… (Obviously I do all the stuff that I expect back, so it’s not like I want a slave) Am I overreacting? And please, don’t insult me, I’m young, I don’t know many things in life, and I’m here for some advice :/\n",

      "Body text: Okay so to preface, I am a 18 F and my boyfriend is a 18 M. I’m a senior in high school and going off to college soon. This is my first relationship ever and it’s lasted almost 10 months so far. My boyfriend is my very best friend and getting to know him over the past 10 months has really changed my life.

I love being with him though and I value the time we’ve spent together and the memories we made. I never want to lose him. I’m scared that the idea of a boyfriend was more exciting to me than actually being with him.

      "once i got into the relationship i knew i couldn’t let my world revolve around him, like i’ve seen others. i have a lot of hobbies, i volunteer, i play a sport, i go to the gym, and i have a very full and busy social life (i like to party and go out and do everything there is to offer!). but i still feel like i want more and more and i still think about him. a couple months ago i got a whole internship, working 8-5, and then going out with friends in the evenings, but at work i would still daydream about him at my desk, counting down the days til i see him again. during this time i had the internship we were long distance (3 months).\n",
      "\n",
      "tmi but almost every night of that internship i would fantasize about him. he’d call like once every 2-3 days and we’d have an hour and a half long conversation catching eachother up on our lives. but during those calls, after the first half hour it felt like i was on borrowed time, like he was about to say he’s sleepy and hang up and so i have to rush and say everything i wanna say and maybe try and be more interesting so he stays on the call longer. i can’t call him really, because he’s busy, and it feels like if he wanted to talk to me he would call me, so when i call him outside of this he’s almost like “why are you calling?”. he will chat with me when i do but it’s clear he’s got stuff to be doing and he has to get back to, so i don’t do this because him ending the call just makes me feel sad again (ik that’s unreasonable, but it’s like why start something when you know him ending it is gonna hurt)\n",
      "\n",
      "i’ve never been the one to end the interaction, it’s never got to the point where im sick of him. i always always always could be with him more. he’s always the one who says “okay well im sure you’ve got work to do” or “i’m sure you’ve got to be going soon”. he could stay round my house for a week and i wouldn’t have any complaints tbh. \n",
      "\n",
      "so yes, i have hobbies, i have interests, i have incredible friends who i love. i haven’t switched round my life to make room for him, i am also doing a degree and have a social life. and yet i still am so so so obsessed with this man. help!  it can’t be healthy, and it controls my nervous system, waiting for him to text back, holding myself back to stop myself being hurt etc.\n",

      "Today i write to you because something's been on my mind alot and yesterday kind of shook me. I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half, we're both 20, and i used to not spend alot of time with her in the first 6 months of the relationship. I grew to try to become a better partner, so i tried to balance my time more and for a long time we were both fine with how we were seeing each other, or so i thought. Some times we would have some fights; about how i don't consider her and how if you're in love you should want to spend every waking second with your s/o, but i never truly believed that. I often like to spend abit of time apart be it a day or two to recharge, but i tried to agree with her.\n",

I work 40h a week from 10am to 7pm, and i often want to try and work on my writing, art etc, because i spend the weekend at her place and sometimes even days of the week. Say i get there at 8 and i leave at 10. At first i thought it was just me and i should bottle it up and just work on a morning routine to do my stuff, but i don't think i can hide from it anymore. I just feel like i need abit more personal time. we've been seeing for 5-6 days a week for the last few weeks on my days off and i don't want to share her that i would like to spend some of this time alone, and i really need your help on this; i'll share you why.\n",

      "My girlfriend has depression. She's feeling slightly better, but she often has alot of ideas that are unhealthy and she often needs reassurance and a presence. I tried to be that to her, but at the same time i've grown to neglect some things that made me \"me\" if that make sense. I'll still try to be there for her best i can, but the thing is that we've had this argument many times and she used to say that things only ever went my way and i didn't want to see her. It hurt because i genuinely tried to meet both our needs more as time passed, but now she feels satisfied and i don't know how to communicate to her that i just need some breathing time because yesterday she said something that scared me alittle;\n",

      "So i was telling her how i felt tired generally and wanted to spend a day home without going to work, and she asked me if i wanted to spend it with her or at her place- That's cool and i would love that but maybe not that day, the thing is that i didn't say it to her because i didn't want her to think that i don't value her or that she bothers me, a concern that she has and that she beats herself over a lot. A similar thing happened a few days ago where i told her that i would go to the restaurant with my mom on saturday night in two weeks because i haven't been seeing her alot lately given i get home really late and she asked me if we would see each other- She then asked me why i wouldn't move it to the friday so we have two whole days together etc and i felt overwhelmed but she let it go- Thing is she wasn't feeling it, she told me it's alright because we can't be together every weekend but was visibly hurt by it.\n",

      "Body text: I (26F) have been in a relationship with my (32M) partner for almost 3 years. In the beginning of our relationship I saw that he went a bit too over board with alcohol and really any drug under the sun but thought nothing of it as he was a functioning human being who held down a job. When he would get drunk and sometimes when he was sober he would get verbally abusive. Not a degrading me abusive but loud shouting and monologuing about how hard his life has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a beautiful loving relationship for 2 years and in the last 6 months I watched as his sobriety started becoming less frequent. He would drink while working and every night when he came home from work, not excessively but enough to be drunk. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the last month things started to get really bad. He ended up on an all night bender with a woman from the past that we both used to work with and who he had a fling with before me, stayed out all night with her drinking and doing cocaine. I was up all night stewing in anger, only for him to come home at 7am WITH her to our house. I flipped out obviously and he later told me that she had kissed him twice. I was immediately betrayed but we were talking it out as he didn't actually sleep with her or intended to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The week following this, his family came to visit us from overseas and we went away to the countryside to have some time out of the city. While there he was using benzos with alcohol and slipped completely into a psychosis. He was verbally abusive not only to me, but to his entire family. To the point where his father called the cops on him and had him arrested. Twice. He remembers none of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have since left him it's been about 2 weeks and he has hit rock bottom. Which I predicted he would. My entire family now knows the situation and how dire it's become over the last 6 months. I have since realized that when drunk he was incredibly verbally abusive but I didn't realize for a long time. His addictions fully took control over him and I didn't realize I was basically helping him function as I don't drink. So I would make sure to drive and keep him safe from himself. But I don't have the energy to play nurse to him anymore and need to take care of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, in the last 5 days he's sobered up and realized what he's lost with me. He's saying all the right things about getting sober and doing it for himself and not for me. But I have told him he would need to be on his own for at least a year sober in order to learn how to be a new person without substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is still very insistent on the fact that he loves me and wants to do right by himself and by me by going through this. He has stated that he wants to marry me one day. We met up and I explained all the reasons that I am angry and the verbal abuse. He says he is willing to fix himself.\n",

It was so fun and I felt so lucky, but I also learned that my 'best friend' was asked to help plan and basically she was being rude, short and didn't participate in the party planning. She also didn't show up which I was hurt by. we had gone out earlier in the week to celebrate my birthday, so it's not like she forgot, but I thought it was so mean of her to a. be rude to my family and b. bail on the planning and not show up at all.

You had plenty of notice to take off work or even stop by for half an hour but you simply didn't want to which really hurt me. we could have gotten past it but the way that you spoke to me yesterday when i was trying to tell you how i felt was extremely hurtful and i don't care to be treated that way anymore.'\n",

I want to stay and have my own kids after marriage. He is M40. I am F33. Im back and fourth with myself a lot on whether I can be fully accepting of the situation. I like his kids and ex wife. The problem is that it takes away from me. The money is tied up in them, we can't pick up and go. I do not always want them included in every little thing. When we get a place, I will be sharing my finances space and life with 3 kids that are not mine. Its doable but so is starting over with someone else who has not been married or had kids. If your heart is involved, how can you decide to leave? Part of me wants to stay cause it's not that bad. But the other part feels like she's missing out and wants to part ways. It will be painful but doable as well. I also believe that the partner needs to come first as much as the kids do. It should be their mother but she has a new life now and they didn't work out. But if the only true way to mean as much to somebody is to be there before kids then im not sure I agree with this. I believe your life partner is a love your kids can't give you and should be valued just as much as someone values their children. They are 3 teenagers. How would you come to a decision?\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi everyone. I have trouble bringing things up that may cause an issue but I think it's time. My boyfriend  is just a highly critical/judgmental & negative person when it comes to others. He's bothered by the way people look at him in public, the way people dress/look physically, people's personal choices as far as beliefs & personal choices, everything. Early in our relationship we did have quite a few discussions about his views & it seems that he took what I said into consideration & was open to me educating him on things. I do not think I changed his views completely, but he at least does not make ignorant comments (as much) anymore. I hate to think that he's just censoring his self around me. I like for people to feel like they can be themselves. \n",

      "We also have 1 child each & the kids have been spending more time together with us. I notice that his daughter is like a mini him. It's annoying hearing the things they have to say & I definitely do not like telling people about their child. However, I think it's time to have more discussions because he's been hinting at wanting to move in together (not anytime soon).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main things sparing him in this relationship are that his critical & judgmental ways are never directed at me, he holds me in a very high regard. We have a lot of fun together, he's very understanding of my space & moods, we have fun with the kids, our families get along, literally everything is great except his worldview. \n",

      "I'm also a very sensitive person in general so when I talk to some people in my life, they don't really see it as a huge deal. I do enjoy being with him & he's supportive in lots of ways. I'm nervous about having tough conversations because 1) they are extremely difficult for me in relationships. 2) I worry that he's going to be confused about why I didn't express things more openly this entire time. How can I let him know that his critical ways are exhausting & annoying? Thank you in advance<3\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone! This is going to be a mouthful but here I go…\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I have been together for 2 years now but we dated in high school for 3 years. I know his family in and out and when I was younger, I liked his mother because she was the “cool mom” but even then I disagreed with who she was as a person and her parenting style but I was a teenager so I never thought too deeply to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward, I am 24, my partner 25 and I hate this woman… for the way she treated my partner and his brother and the pain she caused them due to her alcoholism, poor relationships with men, lack of financial literacy and overall loud, narcissistic personality. They grew up without fathers, raised by their grandmother while she chased men and got drunk every weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "My partner left to go and work overseas last year and everything has gone to shit since then. He had to leave his younger brother here and he is like a father to him. Since then, his brother has become angrier, depressed and desperately needs therapy because he’s resorted to smoking w**d and using x*nax to cope with the issues of dealing with his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before his brother went down this road,  I was the one who tried to push for him to go to therapy. His mother made the entire conversation about herself, belittled him and then afterwards told me that she doesn’t want him to go to therapy because he will realise that he hates her. Funny enough, he already hates her and is dishing her a fat plate of rudeness, arguments and chaos to her, which i feel is a direct consequence for her neglect as a parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation with his brother saddens me greatly as I grew up with this little boy. I’ve been protecting him since I was a teenager, I was 16 yet I removed him from his mother’s company when she got too drunk and to this day, I try everything that I can possibly do to protect him and keep his interests alive, yet it feels I am watching his potential and happiness deplete day by day from being in the same environment as his mother. I’ve witnessed my partners mother berate him, get drunk and argue with him, allow him to be around grown ups who are drunk and swearing, fighting… she’s brought so many men around him and when they leave her, she blames him… this is only the half of it\n",
      "\n",
      "His teenage brother has now decided, he will be moving overseas to live with us (once I eventually immigrate and when he turns 18)… I love this child and I want the best for him but I can’t help but think it’s unfair that he has a fully capable mother who CAN look after him but my partner and I will assume this responsibility. Nonetheless my partner and I have agreed this will be best for him so it is part of our plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this has happened and my partner still sees his mother in an enduring light. It’s as if he makes excuses for her, saying she’s broken, unhappy and she just needs to stop drinking to fix all of this. I heavily disagree, I believe she has had little to no responsibility for these boys and she’s neglected them for her own pursuits in life… I don’t tell him that though\n",
      "\n",
      "But In February, I told my partner that enough is enough… I will no longer be visiting his mother and that I do not agree with her and how she has neglected his brother and that I am deeply concerned about his behaviour. Since then, his brother has become 100x worse and his mother has done nothing about it. The issue is, my partner still comes to speak to me about everything that is going on and I try my best to listen and support him but at the time time, I cannot control the fucking disgust and anger I have towards his mother. Lately when I’ve started to disagree with him, he has said that I am argumentative and combative when he talks about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my eyes, I’m not trying to be. I’m simply questioning his reality and views and bringing a different perspective to the table, while still trying my best to make my partner feel safe and comfortable to talk to me. At the same time, I understand this is a complex family dynamic but it hurts me to see the part my partner plays in his own suffering, by covering up for someone who continuously hurts him and his family… I believe seeing her as the real villain that she is would set him free but it’s not my place to enforce that.\n",

      "My husband(32) and I (29)have been married for 5 years, and this has always been a part of our relationship — even when we were dating. He loves texting girls.

      "\n",
      "For example, he works out a lot and has sent progress pics to one of these friends (a girl), saying it’s the same as if he were sending them to a guy. I also saw that she sent him an outfit pic — not suggestive, but a mirror selfie. That’s not something I do with my friends (male or female), and it just feels kind of intimate to me.\n",

      "Another time, we were out together one night and he wasn’t on his phone much. Later, I saw a message from her that said something like, “I haven’t heard from you, hope you’re okay, goodnight.” It kind of stopped me in my tracks. I never text anyone enough to have a “goodnight” text routine — and it made me realize they must talk a lot.\n",

      "Title: I need advice\n",
      "Body text: **TL;DR: My fiancé wants to go to university for four years after we get married and he leaves the military, not having a clear plan about building a life with me and starting a family. What should I do?**\n",
      "\n",
      "I, 28(F), have been with my fiancé, 27(M), for nearly 3 years. He is currently in the military and planning to leave at the end of this year. I work full-time and make a decent amount of money, which allows me to put aside a portion of it to contribute to the plan of buying a house together. When we started dating, he had started going to college online to become an engineer after leaving the military. Nevertheless, he has not made any progress, which led him to change schools recently and start from zero because he argued that the program was the issue, on top of working simultaneously. I understand the difficulties of working and studying at the same time, but I also see his lack of commitment and drive, especially as someone who is going to college to study engineering later in life, prioritising games, movies and other distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we are months away from getting married and living together, I'm starting to feel unsure about our future. When we talk about finances after he leaves, it seems like he has no idea what he will be doing to contribute to our income and just wants to go to college for the next 4 years. That means I will be the only person making a consistent income for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been left with the task of finding solutions for us, to make sure we don't blow our savings and continue to be on track to afford buying a house. Since I will be the only one working, we are planning on moving to my parents’ house for now, after the wedding, and see how it goes, but honestly, I'm having a mental breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a woman who is nearly 30 (I’ll turn 29 in October, he is nearly 2 years younger) , I want to start my life after spending the last 2 years in a long-distance relationship, stuck because of his commitments, waiting for the day when we would be able to be together and start building our lives. Now that we are about to be free from the difficulties that the military brings, I feel like I will have to continue to sacrifice for us. I am well aware that at this stage, I need to start thinking about having children, being stable. I work so hard, but now I feel like I will have to be budgeting for the next four years and not enjoy a comfortable life, not be able to have kids, and live with my parents until something changes, not even being sure if he will be able to complete the degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we talk, he just says that it will all work out, but doesn't bring a clear plan at least for the first months or years, and doesn't help with what needs to be done. People around him talk to him as if he was still 18, without husband responsibilities, saying that college is the most important and shouldn't worry about anything else. I already feel like a mom cause I need to tell him to study, to take university seriously. I love him very much and he is a lovely man, but I'm scared the next years are going to take a huge toll on me.\n",

      "Title: me (21) and my bf (21) are in a happy relationship but he’s very financially unstable, not very smart, and he isn’t passionate. I don’t know if it’s time to let go.\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR : my boyfriend (21) and I (21) have a very healthy relationship. He protects my heart more than anything, and he gives me what he can but he is so bad with his money. he’s not the brightest and he lacks some common sense. He was the only child, but like most people, we’ve had to teach ourselves things. he isn’t passionate about anything, and we basically only have small talk . In a way, I feel like his mother and he seems to kinda get upset when we have conversations because of how much I have to correct him or I have to basically teach him everything. I love him, and he loves me even more, but I want a partner who I can depend on and I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be long, and I’m still gonna try to sum it up, but someone please. If you could take the time to read I would appreciate it because I genuinely need help and don’t know what to do. How do you even bring a conversation like this up to a partner without completely crushing their soul? My boyfriend and I are both 21 years old. He is an amazing partner emotionally. We got into a relationship quick after meeting each other, it just felt right. He was so emotionally open that I think it made us fall in love very quickly. he is very gentle with me. He’s never raised his voice. He doesn’t argue, and he always puts me first when it comes to his plans or prioritizing quality time together. he isn’t controlling, and just overall We have a very healthy relationship. We have been together for almost 11 months, and from the beginning, we have always talked about our future together like marriage, kids, and, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I met him, he has always been on and off of jobs. Probably every 2 to 3 months he has to get a new job and he’s never been financially stable for more than 3 weeks. He grew up only child with a single mother. So no one around him has really taught him anything about money. Without being said i’ve dealt with financially unstable partners before, and it’s something that irritates me deep in my core, because it’s one thing to go through that for a little bit, but since I’ve known him, this has been the case, and there’s so many times, I have had to almost worry for him, because I feel like he doesn’t have anything in the bank. He doesn’t talk about his financials with me, and he’s been using money apps, so I’m sure he has a lot of built-up debt. he has to unlock his card Every time he goes and makes a purchase because he’s scared he will get a charge on his card. Except clearly If you have a charge on your card, Then it’s probably a bill that you have to pay . he owes money at the Gym because he never paid his membership and says that he will never pay it. He can’t download apps, because he hasn’t paid his Apple Music and etc. This is just to name a few examples of how terrible his money habits are .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " I grew up with my mother working, and also splitting bills with my father, who didn’t even pick up his dish after he finished dinner, so I’ve made it very clear that if I am expected to do all the house, chores like cooking and cleaning every single day then I will not be splitting bills especially when it comes time to have children . Most of the time I pay for my own food and I can count on my hands. How many dates we’ve been on and there’s only been one time. He planned one date by himself, and that was only after I told him to do that :/ he says he’s gonna do all these things, but they are always just empty words that never come true. When he says he’s gonna do some thing, or get some thing for me. I always just smile and nod . I grew up the oldest child and my parents also didn’t teach me about money, but that is where I realized I had to teach myself everything, especially now where any information is so accessible. I hate that. He isn’t at the maturity level, where he realizes he needs to be financially literate, and do things for himself, like creating budgets, or saving money . He is very undependable, and I could never ask him for help if I needed it . \n",
      "\n",
      "I love learning about everything that I can. I feel like I have a bunch of just random little facts about most topics people could think of including music, art space nature, animals, psychology,  Just honestly everything and I feel like I’m a very intellectual person who loves to have deep conversations about all of those things. I feel like me, and him can’t ever have actual deep conversations, because he will say some dumb nonsense or just nothing at all. And I feel like it’s because we aren’t mentally at the same place. In general, he’s not a very smart person, and sometimes he can lack a common sense. I feel like sometimes when we have conversations he gets irritated because I’m correcting him on most things because he just doesn’t know much , he’s not an idiot by any means there is just so much that he doesn’t know, and for his age. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like most of the things tend to just be common knowledge. I just almost feel like I’m his mother, and he is my child. it truly gets exhausting, dealing with my own things, and then also me worrying about him and helping him create budgets. I wish he could figure things out by himself, and I also wish that we could connect on things that are important to one another. And no, you don’t have to be a genius for me to feel a connection with you, but I feel like he isn’t passionate about anything. I feel like that’s what it makes me emotionally unfilled and now I almost resent him for it. And I feel like I’m acting not like myself around him, and just more bland and dry. I grew up and only child, I don’t wanna teach a man life skills when no one taught me. And I definitely don’t wanna teach a man how to take care of a woman financially enough or at least be financially stable to were she feels stability in her life, and like she could be a future with this person. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know he’s struggling and a lot of the job situations really aren’t his fault. But why is it that I always have to deal with men like this. I’m trying to figure out my own life , and it gets so draining when you can’t ever relax, and you can’t have your partner just take over for you and you’ll be comfortable enough with him to where you know you don’t have to do things yourself. Instead of being more feminine when I’m with him, I feel more masculine, like I have to take the role of leader, and tell him what to do. that’s definitely not the life that I wanna live.\n",
      "\n",
      "and I know he didn’t have any handouts but I just feel drained. And I know Love isn’t always enough to keep a relationship. I don’t know if these are things that could be resolved or if I’m being too hard on him, but I know what I want. And I know I’m not asking for too much. I think it might be time to let go, but I couldn’t see myself without this person. maybe we’re just still young and I know that we don’t have things figured out, but it’s just sad because even emotionally I’m craving something deeper, and a more passionate love but I truly do love him, and he is genuinely SUCH a good and patient man. We’re best friends, and we spend more time together than not. I just wish he was smart enough to help himself as well as being intelectual or maybe even smart enough to be passionate and feel deep emotions about things. how could you possibly bring this up to a partner who loves you even more than you love them without completely crushing them when they are nothing but so so caring and loving to you? \n",

      "Title: My girlfriend doesn’t initiate sex (lesbian relationship)\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR; :My girlfriend won’t initiate sex even after I’ve had a conversation with her about it, she says she’s hyper sexual and loves sex, but unless I initiate it then..there ya go. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So ima start off by saying that a lot of these posts on here about the girlfriend not initiating sex is about a straight couple, usually a woman to a man. I don’t know if it’s because women have a lower testosterone level than men or what, but that’s usually how it goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation is a bit different, I’m a woman (22) and my gf (26) doesn’t initiate sex, we haven’t been together long that’s my main issue. We’ve been together for 3 months, known eachother for longer but only officially been together 3. My girlfriend has expressed to me she likes being dominant in bed but honestly most the time I don’t want to be the submissive one. Too many exes in the past have made me feel bad about wanting to be the submissive (most women in the lesbian world ARENT dominant) and so over the years I’ve kinda changed my role. I like being the top now. Only every blue moon do I like being dominated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now don’t get me wrong she ALSO loves being submissive ontop of being dominant, whenever we do have sex it’s very intimate, whenever I’m inside her with a strap or my fingers are inside or I’m eating her out or whatever I’m doing, she’s always touching my chest or kissing me or rubbing all over my body. It’s extremely erotic on both our ends and she seems like she really enjoys it once I start. I don’t doubt she likes the sex pretty much is what I’m getting at. Even after she finishes and I ask her if she’s done she says no and wants me to keep going. We could go for a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I swear it’s seemed like if I don’t initiate things they never happen. I’ve been questioning if she’s into me, but I stop myself because she’s extremely closed off from everyone else. Like I mean she’s told me if she didn’t have to go to work, I’d be the only person she’d ever wanna spend all her days with. She constantly tries to go out of her way to do nice things for me, she compliments me quite a bit, and she always tells me she loves me. Maybe she’s just not sexually attracted to me? Maybe she’s too shy asking about it? \n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought up before that she never initiates sex, but I didn’t word it like that. I worded it like “why do you never show me you want sex? Like maybe a certain look or you bite your lip or you give me subtle hints that you want it?” And all she’s givin me is two answers; that she does feel like she shows it it’s just I don’t seem to see any hints (I swear she never hints at it I’m not just being dumb haha), or she says that she’s not used to being the one to initiate sex so it’s strange to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "A little background, she’s been with men and women in the last and the men specifically always initiated LOTS of sex is what she told me. She always was being asked and never had to be the one initiating things. But if that’s the case wouldn’t she try ti put in some effort to try to change that? It doesn’t take much to ask for sex or to give hints. If I’ve spoken to her about this before then why hasn’t there been any changes? And since our relationship is so fresh you’d think we’d still be having lots of sex 3 months in. When we first got together it was a lot of sex, almost every night. She expressed to me in the past she’s hypersexual and that she’s “like to have sex once or twice a day” I’m like :0 . I’m not the most sexual person in the world so that’s quite a bit for me BUT I mainly get off when someone gives me hints they want it. So now we could go a week or two and nothing, unless I initiate. I’m convinced if I stop completely we just won’t have sex. And I’m not the most sexual creature in the world like I’ve said so it wouldn’t bother me too much if we don’t have sex but I definitely feel more connected with her on a deeper level when we do get intimate. She’s also explained to me she feels more connected when we have sex too. What should I do? \n",

      "Body text: Hi guys! Looking for some advice. My boyfriend, M18, has signs of being an avoidant attachment style (I think but please feel free to correct me), meanwhile I, F18, am an anxious attachment style (again, I think). We have been dating for a few months and are long-distance (but same time zone).  \n",
      "I am looking for advice because our relationship isn't the healthiest, and I am crying every day and night. He doesn't communicate his feelings or what he needs with me, and I can't read his mind. He has had a lot going on recently so I've been trying to keep an open mind, thinking that maybe he just isn't emotionally available to give me what I need right now, but it is still hurting me and weighing on me.  \n",
      "He's working most hours of the day now (2 jobs) and with everything else going on in his life, he hasn't been talking to me much. I've asked what he needs from me to better support him through these hard times but didn't get anything out of it. When I mention something that hurt me or that I didn't like, my feelings are often dismissed, like he doesn't care. I am also an overthinker, so I fear maybe there is something being done behind my back on his side. If not that, it really just feels like he doesn't want me anymore.  \n",
      "I want this relationship to work out, but all it is doing right now is hurting me.  \n",

It feels like he doesn't care about me anymore and doesn't want me anymore. It doesn't even feel like he's treating me as his partner, so I am starting to overthink. Pls SOS\n",

      "Title: Clingy/paranoid girlfriend is driving me nuts\n",
      "Body text: Me (19M) and my girlfriend(18F) are going on 8 months into our relationship. I like this girl but some things are starting to get annoying and I don’t know how to approach it. What do I do cause I want to stay but have want my priorities straight? I’ve tried talking to her about my feelings but instantly feel shut down and guilty because it becomes about her and I can’t speak my mind without her crying. Basically what’s going on is her family has had a lot of unfortunate events happen. Her parents  divorced when she was young and she says that her cause her extreme anxiety and paranoia. Basically daddy issues. She’s has good relations ship with both her parents but there is a lot of drama between my girlfriend’s younger sister and their stepdad/biological father. There has been issues between her mom and step dad that I heard about 24/7 and now it’s about her sister and her dad 24/7. Her little sister gets on my nerves because she believes she is the main character in any family relationship. All of it gets put onto my girlfriend which then gets passed down to me via crying, silent treatment, and clinginess.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend his extremely clingy and emotional. For example, I try to leave her dorm and she will be g for me to stay and hold her longer b it then when I’m about to open the door she asks for another hug and starts crying because I’m leaving. She blames it on her dad leaving. I can’t go hangout with friends at their fraternity without her crying and complaining about the chance of me cheating in her which isn’t going to happen btw. Blames that on her dad. I trust her all the way so much so where I go home for weekends on end without ever worrying about her cheating or doing something inappropriate. She really doesn’t have any friends, hobbies, or social life tho so I guess that’s why I’m not worried about anything which sounds terrible of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her anxiety is through the roof. So much so to where it affects me and I don’t have history of anxiety. I am the type of person to believe that anxiety or depression doesn’t affect me because I have better stuff to do than worry about it. She constantly asks me to promise her that I’m not gonna leave or if I’m ok when nothing would have provoked it besides stress from school. She’s extremely paranoid about me going out with friends or having a good time at frats like I said because she’s afraid other girls will hit on me. I’m a somewhat decent looking guy and I’ve been approached once by a girl who asked if I had a girlfriend. Obviously I did have a girlfriend so nothing happened. She’s cries thinking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had some issues in the past where we went through stuff and she treated me like harshly and put all the attention on herself. I like space after something happens but it was impossible to do that without her being mad at me. Ever since then I’ve wished she was more mature and started thinking about what life would be like without a girlfriend or with one that was more mature. I’m over the whole situation except for that thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am an extremely busy person all year round rather it be at college doing a  major in mechanical engineering and a minor in ag sci or working 50-70 hours a week on my dads farm. I’m afraid the lack of time spent together is gonna boost her anxiety and paranoia. I’m also stressed because of finals coming up and I have told her I would go on a camping trip with her. Unfortunately, I got guilted into going because of what’s happening with her family right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, I’m tired of the added stress from our relationship. The only issue I have is I’m scared to loose her because she’s the first girl that has given me chance. We are each others first and have done so many things I will remember for ever. She wants to learn my hobby’s and thing I’m interested in which no one has before. To be frank, I love her and all of our good experiences but the bad ones are dragging on me. Sorry for the long read.\n",

Weve been dating for two years now in a sort of long distance relationship (its around 400 miles and we meet a lot), and even though she said on multiple occasions that she wants to have sex and shes sending me lots of nudes when were apart, once were together her attitude is very different.

She does on occasion watch a lot of tiktoks that are horror stories about very unlikely injuries you can get when having sex or getting pregnant though.

      "Body text: My best friend (21F) and I (24NB) have been friends for 10 years. About a year ago, we became platonic partners; However, after what happened, we \"broke up\" and are currently friends.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She used to do drugs. I don't know how often, I didn't ask, nor did I want to know. But I have a phobia of drugs due to an event that happened in my life. I won't go into it, I don't like reliving it, but it involves death. I would have episodes where I became deeply afraid of her to the point I couldn't handle talking to her. In order to be her friend and talk to her normally, I had to pretend she didn't do drugs. I know you're probably wondering why we were friends in that case. She didn't always do drugs. She only started them a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally this lead to our relationship becoming shaky. The drugs resulted in a lot of \"events\", she would lash out at me while under the influence, I would lash out at her because I was afraid of her. It wasn't good. Notably, this built up for roughly a year and a half.\n",

      "We talked during this and she pointed out how we promised to always work through our problems instead of leaving. I felt guilty, because yeah, I did promise that. So I started getting doubts. And, then, she offered to quit the drugs. But the thing is. She said it was easy and the drugs meant nothing to her. So. She had the power to quit this whole time. She just didn't. Even when it hurt me, even when she knew it hurt me. She didn't stop until it was going to affect her, with me leaving. She just didn't care how it hurt me until it affected her.\n",

      "The drugs are supposedly gone, but I don't trust that honestly. We're doing worksheets and trying to repair the relationship. We're looking for relationship therapy.

      "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost a year. We were in a medium-distance relationship for most of it, but it was going fine. Two months ago, he moved to a different continent for six months. I just flew in to visit him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days before my flight, we had an argument. During that fight, he told me he doesn’t know if he still loves me. He said he might just be with me because it’s comfortable and he doesn’t want to hurt me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got here, we talked again. He told me I make him feel at peace and that I make him happy, but he’s not sure if it’s love or just comfort. Ever since I arrived, though, he’s been acting like the perfect boyfriend. He’s been affectionate, attentive, and supportive, overall exhibiting all the signs of what i would call love. He used to hate PDA, but now he’s glued to me in public. Additionally, he said he wants to take care of me and of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a history of commitment issues. He even told me he probably needs therapy. But I don’t know what to do with that, especially since I’ve basically been acting like his therapist while I’m here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disregarding the fact that this is an absolutely diabolical thing to do to someone, I’m just extremely confused by how I am supposed to approach this. I love him so so much, but if he doesn’t love me, there’s not really anything I can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 3 weeks I'll be here, he basically wants us to play house and act like everything is normal while he figures his feelings out, but that, in my humble opinion, is once again a diabolical thing to do to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if I should just accept defeat and take these weeks with him as a gentle transition into never seeing him again, or hold on to hope that he wakes up and realises he is in love with me? (In my logical brain, this sounds like an extremely foolish thing to do to myself.) \n",

      "Title: How Do You Salvage a Relationship That’s This Unequal Between My Girlfriend (19F) And Me (19M)?\n",
      "Body text: The other day I was scrolling through reels and saw a like of a mutual friend of me and my girlfriend on a reel related to cheating and hating your boyfriend and I was intrigued by it because I knew she was dating, so I checked her profile and she had actually removed the posts she had with her boyfriend so I thought she had broken up with him. I am not the type to get involved in drama or even give a shit about anything unless its personal but my girlfriend loves gossip so I thought she would want to hear this because that friend was a mutual of me and my girlfriend. When i told this to her she actually lashed out at me because this mutual friend had some bikini pictures up on her highlights and my girlfriend thought i opened her account and saw some of her pictures which made my girlfriend feel insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now i admit even i would feel a little insecure but the point is if i really wanted to see boobies why would i open instagram and even if i did why would i tell my girlfriend. either way i tried to understand her perspective too and tried to calm her down until she called me a 'desperate pervert' and a '(insert really bad word for someone who sleeps around alot)' for doing that not just once but multiple times. which hurt me so i asked her for a breakup, after realizing the gravity she switched to apologizing for what she said and asked to meet up the next day. after meeting up with her i asked her to give me some time as the things she called me were very insulting and kind of a dealbreaker for me but i told her ill try, i didnt make any promises though. when we went back to our homes she asked me to join a google meet so that we can watch some videos together and on the google meet when she shared her screen i noticed her DM with some guy with a shirtless pfp and immediately i confronted her about it. to which she replied 'i just wished him happy birthday', 'he is like my brother i know him from before you' and 'i didnt even notice his pfp till you pointed it out'. and honestly my issue isnt with her wishing the guy i have no issue with that, my issue is that was what i did so bad compared to what she did that i deserved to be insulted like that?  its the double standards that genuinely baffle me. something that makes it worse somehow is the fact that the guy who she wished used to have a crush on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this is not even the first time she has actually shown this double standard. it was actually my misfortune that my ex was in the same university as me and my girlfriend, my girlfriend got mad at me when i even noticed my ex. i cant have a premonition that my ex was going to walk on this particular path at this time so i should not look in that general direction and it wasnt even like i was staring at her or even making eye contact i looked away as soon as i realized who she was. to that my girlfriend said 'you are definitely going to cheat on me with her'. on the contrary she would go on to send one of her male friends a voice note of her singing the happy birthday song for him which btw made him feel so special he texted me 'bro your gf is so nice she made me feel so special on my bday'. sucks to hear another guy say this. on this her response was 'how could u doubt me?' and 'i cant control how he felt' and the classic 'hes like a brother to me'. thats true but again her she wouldnt hold me to the same standard she holds herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now i have left my relationship in kind of a half dead state asking her for time to decide whether i want to continue this or no. while i do love her for other things she has done i have actually had enough of this bullshit and these were just two of the many times this has happened earlier that i dont even care to recount here. its reached such such a consistent scale that a year back i used to have panic attacks when she pulled this kind of crap but nowadays i just sigh and either try to ignore it because its not worth my time. i just wanted to get some opinion on this and would yall still try to salvage it and how? or would yall just leave at this point?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR My girlfriend has been holding me to her standards that she herself doesnt follow. she basically gets mad at me and insults or tries to one up me when i do something or i did something in the past before i dated her and when turns out she did something similar or even worse she immediately turns the guns on me by saying how i can doubt her and i should trust her more. the post mentions the specifics of the situation but my question is just to know what you yall would do in this situation and if you would choose to salvage how would you do it?\n",

      "Body text: Me ( 18M ) and my girlfriend ( 17F ) have been dating for over half a year now and we're still in some kind of honeymoon phase. We're very affectionate with each other and everyone knows us as the lovebirds.\n",

We decided not to try dating because our views of a relationship were so different, but we remained as friends and then before winter I started dating my current girlfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Me and that guy friend don't hang out outside of school and we just chit chat during breaks, but my girlfriend doesn't like it at all. According to her the guy friend took an advantage of me, even tho I've said that the kissing and stuff was okay with me. She also gets a little jealous when I talk to him. I've told her that if she wants I can cut him off of my life but she just keeps saying that she can't take my friend away from me, but she still gets all grumpy when she sees me talking to him. What should I do?\n",

My gf keeps getting jealous when I talk with the guy even tho she knows that we haven't hung out outside of school for almost a year and didn't even try dating. We just kissed a few times. I wonder if I should cut him off?\n",

      "Title: Boyfriend m(35) and myself f(31) have been communicating about how to improve our sex life, dating for > 1 year\n",
      "Body text: I expressed I felt that it felt impersonal because it feels like it is a routine, and especially when he needs to finish it has to in a *very* specific position, down to every detail of even having his head over my left shoulder his head buried in the pillow. When I tried to have him switch his head over the other shoulder he couldn’t get back into it. When we had an open conversation, I asked why he felt it had to end this way. He responded with “I just have to get into the right head space, where I feel safe, I’m with my person and I don’t have any distractions”, while I don’t want him to feel anything less then safe and feel like he is with his person, it does feel very disconnecting that he can’t look at me and almost have a moment all about him rather then it connecting us closer. Asking a little further, seems like this has been consistent, as in he had to be in this position to get to his end to, further drove the point that this is not about connecting together through sex just simply needing to block out distractions “like your boobs”, to be able to get in the right headspace to cum. I just want to gain some other people’s perspective, advice or things we can try to help both of us. He wants to try but when we tried to have sex again without going into that position he wasn’t able to cum because he’s too in his head which I understand because of the situation above, but I just want to help this situation move forward because if we continue this I just feel like I’m the same routine he followed with his past partners and I’m more like a quick means to an end\n",

      "Title: My (M20) girlfriend (F25) and I have been together almost 2 years and she never initiates sex and would be happy having sex once a month.\n",
      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",
      "\n",
      "This disparity in our sexual desires discourages me because I’ve heard numerous stories about how sex frequency naturally declines as people age and relationships settle into a routine. Unfortunately, my situation is already at the very low end of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

      "Any advice is extremely appreciated. I don’t even know if I want advice as much as I just want to be heard or to be understood or related to. Sorry for the formatting I am on mobile.

      "\n",
      "So apologies for the long post but like the title says, my boyfriend’s ex keeps texting him randomly throughout the almost two years we’ve been together. They dated for two years then broke up, it was LDR and his longest relationship ever. Also his first “real” relationship. They broke up on not good terms and he’s mentioned to me he feels guilty on how things ended and some mistakes he made during their relationship. We started dating/seeing each other about 2-3 months after they broke up. We have had a few major fights about her throughout the duration of our relationship and then she got diagnosed with bipolar disorder last summer and he feels like he needs to respond when she texts him. Everything got more complicated. We are almost at 2 years together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first major fight was early on in our relationship when we were just “talking and casually dating”. She called him a few times in one weekend and he brushed it off so lightly saying he didn’t know why she was calling. Later on when I saw their messages he had told her a week or two prior he was open to catching up sometime. So not sure why he acted surprised she called. He didn’t tell her he was talking to someone new and his justification was he felt like it was mean to rub it in her face essentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time he accidentally posted a Snapchat story of us one night out and freaked out the next morning asking if I posted it…. Which I didn’t and he eventually apologized for accusing me. He said he had to delete it right away and he was freaking out because he didn’t want her to go all crazy on him since she didn’t know he was seeing someone new.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third time was a few months later I believe she called and texted again and I told him it made me feel uncomfortable. I asked him to let her know he’s seeing someone new and that she shouldn’t text or call just to “chat” and if it’s an emergency she can obviously reach out. He said he handled it. Later I saw the message he sent her and it basically said something along the lines of “hey I recently started seeing someone new and she doesn’t feel comfortable with me talking to you. So out of respect for her can you not call or text without any notice. Sorry” basically. We had been seeing each other for over 5 months at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth time we argued was over the fact that he would keep photos of her on his camera roll and it would occasionally pop up on this widget thing he has on his Home Screen. I asked him to remove it by putting them in either a drop box or shared album. Just away so it doesn’t need to keep popping up when we are together. He said he will and handled it. It kept popping up and I asked him if he actually did it or not. He said it’s too much work because there are so many photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth time he moved in with me and wanted to bring their cards and photos to my apartment because she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he was afraid something would happen to her since she was unwell. I said okay fine, please put it in something, seal it up, and into storage then. He agreed. I told him on one condition, when we move into our next lease together (his lease ended so he stayed with me for a few months until mine ended at the time) I don’t want it in our new home together. He can ship it to his parents house or put it in a storage locker. I don’t want to bring it into our new home together, and he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward, we move in together and he brought it with him. I even saw it when we were packing up to move and reminded him. He said obviously he’ll get rid of it don’t worry. He brought it in, I waited the first night when we unpacked and cleaned up to see if he would throw it away or something he didn’t. When I brought this up to him he said he wanted me to see him throw it away and he had just honestly forgotten about it. Whatever, we talked it out and maybe misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the other day she texts him, and he told me right away and kinda shrugged it off as a random dumb text. He didn’t seem to care to respond to it or at least that was the impression I got. It’s been for days since then and it’s been kinda in the back of my mind wondering if he responded. I feel like since he keeps responding even though it’s short, she keeps reaching out. Tonight at dinner, he got a text notification and immediately grabbed his phone at an angle so I couldn’t see the screen then put his phone in his pocket. I just immediately got a gut feeling it was her. I asked him did you ever respond. He said yeah then said “oh she actually just texted me back” and tries to show me. He texted her responding to her message after four days from her original text and said “blah blah blah happy Mother’s Day. Hope you and daughters name are doing well”. Then got upset at me and walked away. We got into a screaming match and he said I am so insecure about her for no reason and it’s ridiculous basically. I shouldn’t worry and that he just feels bad for her because she’s unwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it. She’s mentally ill but also like it’s not your problem anymore … she lives in a different state and has friends and family who care about her. You don’t need to be feeling bad and trying to talk her down. I just can’t shake that he’s okay with me feeling insecure (the “love of his life”) about it and upset that he seems to care more about her well being than how I feel about the situation. I’m not sure if I’m being too sensitive and should just deal with it because she’s mentally ill.\n",

We have had multiple convos about it every time she reaches out but seem to always get escalated and not resolved. I trust him and it’s not romantic. I know he feels bad for her and wants to be a good person but it’s a boundary for me.  Am I being too much and difficult for no reason.\n",

For the most part I agree and I told her that we will organize some double dates or some other activities where the girls will be invited. She was not happy and for some reason just wouldn’t let up. So last saturday I caved and she came to ufc night at mine. My other friends girl was busy that night, so she was the only girl there. other than greetings and small talk nobody really talked to her and she mostly just stuck to me. Fast forward 2 days and my friend told his girl that everyone found it awkward that she was there, and felt like they couIdn’t really act like themselves. I am sure that nobody said that, and he is just telling that to his girl so that she doesn’t want to come in the future. I know it sounds fucked but that guy is fucked in the way he treats/manipulates his girl. However now his girl told my girl and she really isnt happy. She thinks its extremely mean on my friends part to have even said that, and when i told her that nobody said that she just tells me that they obviously wouldnt tell me and that im wrong and they really all felt awkward because of her. Now shes saying she never wants to come again and she is really not happy. Personally i never wanted it to be like this but that is honestly exactly what I pictured happening and I really dont see why we can’t just have boys nights once in a while. Im trying to explain to her that since most of my friends are single, nobody wants to be THAT guy bringing his girl to the function and now suddenly nobody can be themselves anymore and its awkward… My friends don’t really know my girl like that so i can understand why her being there made it awkward for them. We have been dating for almost 4 years now and UFC has always just been for the boys. Am I wrong for wanting to have some nights that are just for the guys every once in a while?\n",

      "Body text: Hello, this might be a mess so i’m sorry in advance. I’m (21f) and i’m in a relationship with a (34m) who is in prison. It is my first relationship and I didn’t know it could be this painful. It started out really good and I was happy to finally have someone to talk to. I haven’t had friends for a long time, i’m not good at interacting with people but he made it easy. It started with only messaging but after about a month, he started to call me and it would then be every night. After, a few months of talking, I think? He tells me he loves me, it took me longer to say it but I truly feel it and have never felt this way about anybody else before.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I struggle with my mental health a lot and he has known this since the start. I started to take medication around a year ago because of how bad things were. He has never liked me being on them and doesn’t think I need them. One of the reasons why I stopped last year in December was because of that. I feel bad every day and when I try to talk about one of my biggest problems (DPDR) he confuses me because he makes me feel like it’s not real. I spoke to him about it not long ago and he says i’m not disconnected when i’m trying to tell him about it and got mad at me when I said he’s confusing me because it felt like he was saying there is nothing wrong with me. His tone changed and he sounded annoyed which made it hard for me to speak because I started to feel anxious which only made him even more frustrated. He has been through so much himself and still struggles, so I feel guilty when I get frustrated because he has experience and knows what he’s talking about.\n",

He told me he’s not speaking to me while i’m there and he hopes it was worth ruining our relationship but we did speak and he called me. I felt really bad after because he was upset and frustrated with me. He explained it all to me the first night we were there on the phone and said it’s because he knows what’s best for me. He knew I would be anxious because it’s a different place and all the people that would be around when we were out. I understood that and felt guilty that I didn’t have more trust in him because he was thinking about how it would affect me.\n",

      "Body text: As per the title, my boyfriend is watching porn and I don’t know how to talk to him about the issue. I’ve never brought the issue up before- I knew he sometimes watched it and was never a huge fan, but not enough to talk about it. Unfortunately, porn is so common in the modern age and he’s had a VERY sexually active life before me with a high sex drive, so I brushed it off. Lately though it’s been bothering me a lot. We live together and have been together for a few years now, I love him more than anything, so it’s not enough to tarnish my image of him or anything. But I’ve never had to have this talk with anyone before (especially because we never set this boundary; I’ve never told him I didn’t want him watching porn since I didn’t know it bothered me, and he’s brought it up without me asking him to not.) and I don’t know how to go about it. I think he might also have an OF account which I’m 100% not okay with, but I don’t have solid proof yet so I’m also planning on telling him that I think OF subscriptions are akin to cheating (which I know will make him immediately unsubscribe. He’s been cheated on and had his heart beyond shattered from it and is a genuinely good guy, so I don’t think he quite understands that subscribing to other women’s sexual content can be seen as cheating until I explain it to him). We’ve never had any fights before ever since both of us are the kind to immediately talk about any issues and we’re incredibly open and honest with each other, so I want to absolutely let him know before resentment builds or I accidentally snap and get grumpy. Advice and tips for this conversation are absolutely appreciated! \n",

      "Title: I (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) are in a very loving relationship, but I can't help feeling drained and sometimes a lot of quiet fatigue and anger at him. Is it something I need to fix within myself, or something we should change?\n",
      "Body text: I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for a few months, after a close friendship that turned into a relationship. He’s incredibly sweet. He cooks for me, takes care of me when I’m sick, planned a dream Valentine's day date, and genuinely tries to be a good partner. I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways, he really *shows up*. We've spilled our souls to each other and he knows about my past and my mental health and chronic illness struggles. I grew up with some very traumatic events in my childhood and destructive and abusive relationships at young ages, and he never shamed me or made me feel any less for it. It's all I wanted in someone and never thought I could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite all that, I’m starting to feel like I’m slowly disappearing in this relationship. He follows me everywhere, literally. In every social situation, at university, with friends, to my alone time. People now barely even know me outside of just expecting him to be there, and I feel like I’ve lost a lot of my identity and independence trying to accommodate him. It’s not that he’s controlling at all. He’s just… *there*. All the time. And emotionally very dependent on me. He’s also had a hard, traumatic past with bullying and doesn't have many close friends at all, and I so understand why he craves closeness, but I’m starting to feel like his emotional anchor, his mirror, and his support system, while barely holding myself together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve tried talking to him about needing space, and he *does* listen. But then the cycle repeats. I end up explaining myself over and over or becoming unwell just to be allowed to rest or have time alone. He gets slightly cold takes it personally even when he says he doesn’t. And the guilt is killing me, even when he says to me to not be guilty. Because I love that he always wants to be with me. That he tells me I'm always in his plans. And I know I'm young, we both are, though we've met each others' parents and are very seriously dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a growing disconnect in how we see the world. He has somewhat rigid ideas about his role \"as a man\": he insists on always paying for everything (despite us both being students), never letting me carry emotional weight, and acting like he has to suffer in silence to protect me. I know it comes from a caring place, but I want an equal in a partner. I tell him so often I want him to have a safe place in me and he says he does and that I don't have to go it alone either.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the same with how we think. We’re in the same science/medical degree, but I’m also very poetic, abstract, and creative. He jokes that it’s all “humanities nerd shit.” He’s very logical, very black-and-white in his thinking, and sometimes I feel like the parts of me that matter most (my voice, my way of seeing, the soft and strange language I live in) just don’t land with him. He’s not cruel. He’s not homophobic (I'm bisexual, he just doesn't know this) I don’t feel unsafe, I just feel subtly unseen. I find myself toning down my queerness, my language, my culture (he's White and i'm South Asian), my softness around him, just to make the air more breathable. And after a while, that’s exhausting. He says I don't seem \"overly sensitive like all those people\", but I've always been very tender-hearted and empathetic, it's like I've been dulling it around him like I do with the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him. He’s kind. He treats me so well, with so much care. But I feel like I’m suffocating. I really don’t want to break up or take space from him, I believe in nuance, and growing and changing. But I don’t want to lose myself either. I've noticed a decrease in my desire to spend time with him (sometimes even dreading it) or to cuddle or be physically intimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I handle this? I've communicated with him as nicely as possible for taking my own time off or making separate plans, and sometimes when he's joked about things or said things that I find upsetting (not maliciously, we both like our dark humour), I've let myself express that I don't want to. I've noticed a lot of my friendships fade, being simultaneously so happy and light with how he treats me and then heavy and crying my guts out.

I didn’t end things, but I was clear that I wouldn't feel comfortable being around these guys or with her spending time with them. At the same time, I told her I wasn’t going to try to control who she sees. I’m not her parent.

      "Body text: TLDR: \\~5 months into our \\~10 month relationship my gf (first serious relationship) was forced to live with me for 3.5 months before my roommates ended the arrangement and she had to move into her car and I moved into my parents' place. How should we proceed with our relationship? \\[full context below\\]\n",

      "As the title says I have been with my beautiful girlfriend for \\~10 months, \\*and this is my first serious relationship\\*. We instantly hit it off and were very happy together. Around 5 months in, I let her stay at my place (with my two best friend roommates) to recover from an emergency appendectomy that had complications (she is emancipated and does not interact with her abusive family, and she said her few friends are all married and didn't have the capacity to allow her to live with them). I work from home so it was easy to keep an eye on her. Her education job placed her on administrative leave and she claimed she left her apartment key in her office when she left for the hospital, in a locked space that she said was inaccessible while she was on leave. So she was stuck with me, and this continued for around 2 months until she said she lost the rights to her apartment, which was temporarily granted to her as part of a victim protection program by the DA. So she was stuck living me, with her job refusing to pay her for her time off while she was in recovery (this was valid, her doctors were all excusing her from work but her job refused to pay her). My roommates were not comfortable with her staying there for so long, but I defended her stating I love her and that she had nowhere to go and I was happy to support her recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "My roommates never warmed up to this situation. I understood their pov but this still frustrated me and my girlfriend because we always made an effort to minimize her footprint at the place; they were the messy ones and my gf would often clean up after them. These are friends I've had since I was young and I implored them to extend their love for me to her. But after around 3.5 months total of this, my roommates decided they wanted to move out because they didn't like the arrangement. They didn't want me to live with them if my girlfriend would still be with me, so they got a new place together and I moved in with my parents, and my girlfriend moved into her car. She has now been in her car for around 2 months since we moved out and it has been extremely difficult; she was still dealing with some lingering effects from her surgery and had also fractured her foot a few weeks before we moved out. She has been paying for her insurance and car payments and phone bills and all that without having any income, so her savings is beginning to run dry. She has only just recently returned to work but doesn't have the money to start renting her own place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other kicker: my parents knew she was recovering at my place for a few weeks but I did not tell them she stayed with me for all those months until it was almost time for us to move out. I was afraid to tell them because they are older and highly traditional and wouldn't approve of her staying with me. I see this was a mistake and I should have stood by my decision, because now my parents strongly dislike her and feel like she was manipulating me. They have not handled it well and have on more than one occasion borderline verbally abused her, even while I was with her in the hospital for something, and they have caused her a huge amount of stress. While I'm staying at home my parents are always in my business and trying to control where I go and what I do with my spare time, when really I'm just trying to comfort my hurting gf that I love a lot while she is stuck in her car, and it has negatively impacted my relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I am stuck living in my stressful home because I can't find an available friend to move in with; rent in SoCal is expensive and I don't want want to pay $2k/mo for a one bedroom (I can afford it, this would be around 32% of my monthly income, I just strongly prefer to save $$ with a roommate(s)). My gf and I love each other a lot and she is pushing me to get a place for us together, with a rent split based on our income. I love her a lot but I am afraid to move in with a partner in this kind of rushed way; it's been under a year and I never envisioned moving in with a partner to \"solve a problem\" like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "My gf is great, she is working her ass off still trying to finish college while working in her education job and dealing with her medical issues and she loves me a lot, she just comes from difficult circumstances with no family support and having to take care of herself since she was 15. She has helped people in the past that were in similar situations as her, and she would do the same for me, so it's been difficult for us to process the fact that I'm not ready for this step. Despite the stress we were happy together while she was living with me. It definitely fcks with me that my parents are so judgmental of the situation and I don't want to damage my relationship with them further by moving out with her without their approval, but at the same time I'm 26 and should make my own decisions. I am doing my best to assess the strength of our relationship while pushing aside this situation and my parents' and friends' disapproval because they don't know her nearly as well as I do, but it's all fallen on me and it's been hard to navigate myself. My gf is bitter towards my parents for treating her the way they have and she doesn't understand why I'd continue to subject myself to them by living here. There are certain things about her I'm not super crazy about; I think she likes to spend money on trinkets and food and some clothes when she should be saving to improve her position in life (we've always known I'm more of a saver she is more of a spender). But for the most part she is amazing and drop dead beautiful and smart and caring and we have a lot of fun together. She loves me and supports me and appreciates me and wants us to grow together as people and explore life and hobbies together; she'd love for me to marry her but I am scared of these types of feelings with her being my first serious gf and us only dating 10 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I resolve this situation to appease both my gf and my parents? Or are there reasons you think I'd be better off cutting it off? I'm trying to get them to sit down with each other to hash it out, but I don't know how much it'd help, and my gf is still kinda scarred by how they have treated her. I can edit this with more relevant info if it is requested.\n",

      "Title: How should I navigate dramatic differences in music and TV tastes, to preserve an otherwise strong, loving, and supportive relationship?\n",
      "Body text: I am 50 years old, divorced, and about three months into a new relationship with a widow (45 years old, female).  We love each other madly and have a lot of fun together.  She's beautiful, sexy, and has a fiery energy that crackles, along with a devilishly clever sense of humor that makes me laugh my proverbial ass off.  She's also very nurturing and a great cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have two passions (\"hobbies\") that don't mesh with her at all. I'm a major music maven, with a strong interest in cinema and \"premium TV\".  You could call me a \"hipster\" in both respects.  My girlfriend is much more conventional in her own tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With music, I'm kind of like the main character in the movie High Fidelity. I have a huge and carefully curated collection of thousands of songs and albums from across the past 70 years or so, and I'm constantly seeking out more, whether it's undiscovered gems from the Fifties or brand new indie tracks, and everything in between. I'm not squarely against Top 40 stuff on principle (I enjoy the Beatles, Stones, etc., along with Eighties synth-pop and even Taylor Swift) but I don't like most of it.  The lion's share of my favorites, especially my 21st century faves, are less well-known acts like the Decemberists, Father John Misty, and cleopatrick.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend will often say that she likes music \"as much as the next person\", but finds it weird and offputting to be SO damned \"obsessive\" about it.  For my part, I hate most of the music she listens to--mostly modern country and Nineties R&B pop.  I also find myself gritting my teeth at her habit (which, again, I think is very common) of flipping around from song to song right in the middle (I find this way too abrupt and would prefer either letting the song get to the end before changing it, or at least fading it out). Then there's the way she cranks up songs she loves (usually roadhouse/redneck style country) to where the car stereo can't really handle it and it sounds very distorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for TV and cinema: I belong to online groups and subscribe to podcasts devoted to independent and foreign films, along with ones oriented around \"premium TV\".  (For anyone not familiar with that latter term, this started back in the day with The Sopranos, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad; more recently, it's been Succession, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Adolescence, stuff like that.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I, again, am keenly aware that my way of watching TV is not the norm. And I don't only mean my tastes, but even more that back when we all watched \"linear TV\", I never just turned on the TV and flipped through channels.  Instead, I used the TV guide to determine in advance what I was going to watch. Nowadays, similarly, I never open a streaming service and scroll through to see what they are offering me. I always go immediately to the search bar and enter in the name of the show or movie I have decided to check out based on those online groups and podcasts (or, if I have already seen at least one episode, I go to my list and select it).\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend's preferred way to use the TV is to stream an endless procession of YouTube channels, mostly of YouTubers who prepare meals for the homeless. (I watch YouTube hardly at all, and when I do it's not \"channels\".) I find this content fairly excruciating.  I don't tell her that, mind you, unless she directly asks me whether I like it.  But her deceased husband also apparently hated her YouTube channels, so she does try on her own initiative to tear herself away from that stuff at times and use actual streaming services (I get the impression that she rarely does this when I'm not around).\n",
      "\n",
      "But even then, she just wants to see what the Netflix or Hulu algorithm serves up as suggestions, watch a preview/trailer (I don't like doing this because it spoils the show or movie--again, I know I'm weird that way), and \"pick something that looks good\". She doesn't seem to have much interest in going back to anything and following a series, more just watching random movies that pop up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to say I want to spend some evenings at my own home watching TV or listening to music without her, I guarantee she would be hurt and offended by this. I would have to have some other more \"important\" activity lined up to get by with this, but I don't want to lie to her.  I have suggested that maybe sometimes I should just listen to my music on earbuds while we snuggle and she can watch her YouTube creators, but she objects that this would be \"isolating\".  What can I do to bridge this gap and keep an otherwise very desirable relationship going?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My girlfriend and I are extremely incompatible as concerns TV, movies, and music; but I love her a lot and want to make the relationship work. At the same time, I can't handle the idea of just permanently giving up on these things that have been a central feature of my life for decades now.\n",

      "Title: My girlfriend (F19) and I (M21) are part of different religions. Her parents haven’t known about me for a year, but they just found out.\n",
      "Body text: So my girlfriend and I have been dating for one year now. She comes from a Muslim family and I come from a Catholic family. Her parents are more strict than my mom about religion. We both don’t practice our religion really except for my girlfriends, she pretends in front of her parents. I don’t think either of us would convert but we are serious about each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "She has two brothers, both who are dating out of their religion, but it’s different for guys. In Islam, guys can marry outside of their religion but woman can’t. Her oldest brother got a girl pregnant who is Christian and her parents basically forced them to get married. Her other brother is dating a Catholic girl. They found out about her some time ago but he pretended to break up with her and now just lies about the whole thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lives with all her brothers, her parents, her sister in law and her two nieces. Everyone knows about me except her parents.

      "\n",
      "That’s our whole situation. We’ve talked about this before and we agreed that if her parents ask her to break up with me, she won’t. We’re both serious about this relationship so far so I need help deciding how we’re going to deal with this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think telling her parents the truth would be the easiest way of explaining, but we’re not sure how that would turn out. A while ago, her oldest brother was arguing with his parents about how they rushed their wedding. His wife was upset and his mom ended up apologizing to her daughter in law. My girlfriend’s brother told his mom that the only thing he wanted was that she wouldn’t do this with his siblings and that she should be more open. His mom said that she won’t and that she would want them to be happy. I don’t know if she was serious or not, but that’s what was the last conversation about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure if we should downplay it or tell them everything. I think if we tell them we haven’t been dating that long, they’ll be more inclined to think it’s not a big deal for us to end it. So i’m not sure that’s a good idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her brothers aren’t helping much, so far the only things they’ve recommended was to ride it out and to pretend i’m her gay friend, which I believe the latter could work tbh. \n",

      "\n",
      "Examples of things he's said that give me serious pause about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to retire in 5 years\" - When I told him I don't want to be with someone who retires young (my father did, ended up sitting on the couch drinking beer/watching tv until my mother divorced him) he got very defensive, said he wants to start his own company, or just take an easier job (which he has in the past, multiple times), and \"who do I think he is\" (to be fair, I've not been working the past year while he has consistently been employed and successful since teen years). \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just have this job, for now\" - When I introduced him to my parents/friends he downplays his job to the extreme, says he does 'boring stuff with computers'....He makes 400k/year doing difficult programming for a famous company. He'll say things like he may want to do something completely different in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care how I look\" - His clothing choices are.... suspect at best. None of it is dirty, but he has lots of corporate t-shirts, sweatpants, and other such things. Some of his socks have holes in them. I want him to put as much effort into how he looks for me as I put in for him, but he just tells me to throw out his shirts that I don't like. His hair is also unshaped typically. OTOH he is a very avid gym goer and probably has the best body of any man I've ever dated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe in hard work\" - I \\*want\\* a hard working partner. I know he works hard, as I see him but he continues to say that hard work isn't worth it, and to work smarter not harder. I want a hard wroking partner who will always make sure we have a safe and secure future....and with him it just doesn't feel that way\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure what to do.... He seems to get quite defensive when I bring up any of these issues, and I feel like I can't even talk to him about them because he makes \\*me\\* feel bad for even bringing them up. If he's not defensive he'll just brush them off in a dismissive way... like \"yeah, whatever\" type of thing\n",

We have started living together in February and things have been going great, obviously an augment every now and then. Anyways i recently started to do minor petty things in our relationship when he pisses me off Example - we got into an argument the night before, i told him not to come to bed and sleep downstairs (i locked the master bedroom door) Anyways we were baby sitting my brothers puppy and in the morning i hopped up to let her to do business after an hour I forced him to wake up by putting the puppy on him while he was sleeping, this did not work so I jumped into spare bed and cuddled him until he woke up then obviously he proceeded to ignore me when he woke up.

      "Body text: I (22 NB) and my partner (32 Male) have been dating for around 4 months now. He was the first to ask me out and I decided to give it a shot because I hadn't been in a real relationship before and figured if it didn't work out I would just go back to normal since I don't have the mentality that I need one to complete me. Recently my partner casually dropped in passing that he sees us as lifelong partners and the prospect scares me a little. There's nothing wrong with him and I don't see any red flags I just wasn't expecting it and it still feels too early for me to tell if that's what I want. I get the general sense that he is looking for a life partner, someone to be with until he dies but I don't know if I want the same thing. Especially considering we're both at different life stages and I don't feel like I've figured myself out in terms of my own independence and dont want to completely rely on him if things go south. I'm not saying I don't like him, he's lovely so far and I don't see reasons to end things. I just feel anxious at the idea of \"forever\" and don't know if I just need more time to adjust or if I should find out what the root of these feelings are. \n",

      "Body text: my bf(19M) and I have sex relatively early in our relationship (he have been in a relationship for 4 months or a little less) , he was the one i completely felt safe and an urge from deep inside myself that i wanted to have sex with him, even tho i have been involved with other people i have never felt the urge to get naked around someone so when it happened i just let it happen. now it has become a constant thing in out life. it happens every. single. time. we hang out, sometimes i’m not even in the mood or feeling like it however i just want to make him as happy as he makes me. I just don’t know if that is normal in early relationships or if i’m just a pleasure tool. He does do everything to me, flowers, fancy dinners 3 times a week, and shower me in gifts, however always at the end he takes off my clothes. is he using me only for sexual pleasure?\n",

      "Body text: I love my bf and he’s a great person. I just don’t find him physically attractive and it’s mainly his face, which is not his fault. He can’t change his face unless he gets plastic surgeries and obviously I don’t want him to get surgeries just because of me.\n",

      "I had my son, “Aiden,” when I was 17. His mom left our hometown a few months after he was born and never really came back. It’s basically always been just the two of us. I was a kid trying to raise a kid, and I made a ton of mistakes, but I did my best and he turned out great. He’s smart, funny, sarcastic in that teenage way, and way more emotionally mature than I ever was at his age.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Aiden was 10, I met my now-husband, “Mark.” Things moved kind of fast, but I was careful about how I introduced him. I didn’t want Aiden to feel like I was replacing anything. Over the years they’ve been... fine. Not super close, but not at odds either. Mark’s been respectful of boundaries and never tried to play “dad.” He’s just been around, helping out, showing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months ago, after years of talking about it, Mark and I had a baby through surrogacy. Our daughter, “Ellie,” was born in December. She’s amazing. I don’t even have the words. And Mark—he’s glowing. I’ve never seen him this happy. I’m happy, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aiden’s been… not okay. He’s quiet. Distant. Not rude, not lashing out, just... not there in the way he used to be. He spends more time in his room. Says he’s “fine” when I ask. Doesn’t really engage with the baby. He used to come hang out with me while I cooked or watch dumb movies with me late at night—now I barely see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I get it. I do. He had me to himself his whole life. Now suddenly there’s a crying baby, and I’m tired all the time, and I spend most of my energy juggling diapers and bottles and making sure Mark gets some sleep before work. It’s chaos. And I think somewhere in all of that, Aiden started feeling like an afterthought. I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong, exactly, but I think I haven’t done enough right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a small argument the other night—something dumb about him leaving dishes in the sink—and he kind of exploded. Not yelling, but he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your way soon. You have your real family now.” And that gutted me.\n",

He said he didn't have any (we were at work hooking up in his car ) and he insisted it would be fine, he would only put it in for one stroke and I eventually agreed but it just ended up with us fully sleeping together. Then we hooked up 2 more times again all unprotected. My ex just told me today that he may have had something for some time now and the last time we had sex was recent. He told me he wasn't sleeping with anyone else and we were together for 4 years so I slept with him unprotected as well as I trusted him and was under the impression we were only sleeping together even though we were broken up.

      "Whilst for him, he already had more relationship in his past (such as gf/flirt/sexfriends/or just a 1 night thing) with a bodycount up to more than 16 from what he and his friends told me. So what he got with me, he already experienced it with some others persons from his past. And that wasn’t a problem for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2024, I accidentally found in his Reddit likes some women’s naked pictures. At first I was just trying to look for the topic he went through to find some interesting movie because this is how we always search some movies for our chill night. But when I saw all of these, knowing that these women’s was completely different from me was a shock because he knew that in my past relationship I preserved myself sexually with that person, which lead to the point that my ex once compared me to an porn actress and deeply made me feel insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he knew already that this kind of things happening to me is not what I would appreciate him to do. At first I thought that the distance would have been the reason of his actions about that, but I thought that this reason wasn’t really worthy in this situation because he had some pictures and videos of us already from when we were meeting and the dates was corresponding around the days we were physically together. So I was really confused about this and we had a long argument about this until he said that he done this because he “needed something different”.\n",
      "\n",
      "So obviously I was deeply disappointed because in my mind he wouldn’t be this kind of person knowing that story about my ex and me and my body that I gave to him but he told me that a lot of guys do that in their relationship and there is no problem (unless his friends said that when they are in a relationship they don’t do that) he apologised a lot about it ect…\n",
      "\n",
      "But a bit later (probably 2w later) we were talking about our past relationship and he asked me to see my ex because he never saw a picture of him, so by that I ask the same to him about his ex and we both saw, that he liked 2 relevant pictures of her on her account (she was showing he nipples out of her shirt) a few days later after our first time saying that we loved each other (back to the 10th February 2024). Again we had a big argument for days, he told me he wasn’t too sure about why he done that and that he was just trying to annoy her back then and that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all of that happening I have been feeling insecure for months, we are really open about talking our feelings out, so he knows everything about it and try his best to make me feel pretty and seen by him which I appreciate but recently I feel like that he’s been distant around me because of video games (I know it’s completely different but all of this story before is linked with why I’m not too sure if he just got into a routine or he finds me boring)\n",
      "\n",
      "So my bf and i both work, he works about 9hrs a day/3 times every weeks or 4 times sometimes. Our schedule doesn’t align that much, i often got shift in the morning when he’s off or at night, he only works in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing now is that, whenever he’s at home, he only plays his games, we don’t hang out together as lovely date anymore, or he doesn’t surprise me anymore. Even in the cleaning or cooking at home, I feel like he doesn’t try to put the effort like me into doing it anymore because I always do it. He only stays on his computer for the whole day or sometimes after work he comes back home after 7:30pm, eat, go to sleep for a bit, wake up at 10pm and play his game until 5am and go to work if he’s working the next day or just sleep and do that again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He let me fall asleep alone every night, sometimes I try to stay up until he go to bed but he doesn’t really care even if I ask him to come with me. On the sexual side, if I don’t try to put him in the mood, he doesn’t touch me to lead me into it (we use to make love at least 2/3 times a week now it’s only 1 time a week or every 2 weeks).\n",

      "About the wedding he’s not planning or helping me to plan anything, yesterday my friends came over and tried to help me because they were thinking that I must have been stressing on my own and didn’t wanted to let me down on that. He came back from work, eat the food I cooked for him and went to sleep until 10pm and went on his games. I know he’s providing the money for the wedding but I wish he could support me in all of that as my husband. I tried to tell him last night but he said “I came back from work and fell asleep, when I woke up everything was done how can I help?” And I just chose to stop talking about it and let him play his games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that for him being in a different country is hard and playing his games is a way for him to think of something different and to relax after a day with people speaking a different language but I feel like he’s bored with me too and try to escape all the responsibilities of our relationship. I told him multiples time that I was feeling like he doesn’t care of me as much as he used to do and it was scaring me because I don’t want our relationship to be a routine, I know that he is a homebody person so the past 2 months I made the effort of just doing the things he likes so no more visiting cities around like we used to so he can just chill at home around me but I realised that I am not happy this way and feel extremely guilty for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also about our sexual life, I feel like there is no more excitement for him with me and I started wondering if it was because of my body or maybe I wasn’t taking care of myself enough for him but when I ask him he tells me that I am pretty and he’s lucky to have me.

      "Body text: so me and my angel of a boyfriend connected naturally and have been flourishing all these past months. We have crossed so so many hurdles we never thought we would, lot of bad days, ample of good days but for the past 1.5 month something is just not feeling right. We fight/argue almost everyday, actually 6/7 days in a week goes by arguing which ends up ruining the other one's mood because of which rest of the day goes like a shit and sometimes is carried to the next day as well, though neither of us address this, but we do notice. Its not like the spark has faded away or we don't love each other, I could die for him and I still love him so very much and I know the same goes for him as well. We both really want to be stable and have the peace we both deserve from each other. When he tells me about his other friends being in a relationship where they dont argue and live a peaceful life, I get hella jealous and feel bad that I am not able to make this relationship work now. I have a very vibrant chirpy personality, I talk alot and would instantly light up a dead room. I wanted someone who would make me bath with love every second, who would love me like the air he breathes, which he was but off lately, its not like he doesn't love me, but I would say, he became someone like me, who would show tantrums over stupid issues, who would reply in an offensive way, as if I wasn't enough to be doing that and he should've been the one who would make me calm. But thats not the case, we both have been arguing over stupid things with no one knowing how to amend the shit and we just know how to counter each other. We both keep on asking each other back and forth throughout the day as to  what happened, to no avail.  \n",
      "One thing I would like to add as I consider this a really big factor: Since the beginning of our relationship, he has this friend group of some girls from which I was really insecure of, but with time I understood his relation with them and I am not insecure anymore. But all these months, Ive created so much fuss related to them, so much of drama caused by them, that there exists this knot between us because of external people existing between us. YEAAH, I agree there exists a lot of influence of third parties between us, sometimes I got jealous of him going out with them, I on the other hand hardly hangout with guys. But this issue has been resolved as I no longer seek him to amend a distance from his girlies and ive understood.  \n",

      "Body text: Background: I (40M) am in a relationship for the last 18 months with my gf (30F). I’ve been doing app deliveries for the last few months because we’re struggling financially to make some extra cash after work and on weekends. My gf has prior concerns because I tried to be friends with my x-wife and the gf wanted me to establish additional boundaries. I eventually did and believe she was right. Complicated tale, like all failed marriages, and I don’t want to get into it here. She was right. Even if friendly I was providing too much support in communication. And our boundaries needed to be more stringent, even if just because it made my gf uncomfortable. But she overall has trust issues as well. We are living together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation: I got back from doing deliveries , parked in our and apt parking garage, and wanted additional moment to myself. I put on an ASMR video, popped on my AirPods, leaned back the seat, and dozed off. She called me and the call woke me up because I hadn’t responded to some texts. I was flustered. I knew she wanted to hang out when I got back. We share location. She probably saw me sitting there. And I was planning to leave in a little over an hour to hang out with friends tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lied. I said I was on a call with a guy from work. In truth I had talked to him earlier while delivering, via text on my Apple Play (I swear I was safe doing deliveries). But I recounted briefly that conversation as though I was on the phone with him. I was clearly startled. So probably sounded like I was caught red handed. I felt like I had been. I feel guilty taking time to myself sometimes. It’s a personal thing. Not her. I work on it in therapy. I get embarrassed about listening to ASMR. I don’t know why. I just do.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this led me to lie instinctively. I got back upstairs and she asked to see my phone. Checked. Saw I didn’t call the guy from work. Asked what was up. I instantly came clean. She said she was upset I lied so quickly and so easily. I broke her trust. I suspect she thinks I was hiding something more serious. Or something else. I feel awful. I don’t know what to do. We’ve had other problems in the past. But usually can resolve it. How should I go about handling this situation?\n",

      "TL;DR: my girlfriend caught me lying when I fell asleep in my car taking a moment of zen. She says I broke her trust and is pretty upset. \n",

      "Body text: My (F31) boyfriend (M34) at this point have been together for 6 years. During the 4 year mark however a new woman got hired at his workplace and began hitting on him. At first, he told me all about it and even made fun of her for being persistent even after he said no and made it clear he was in a relationship.\n",
      "This went on for about 2 weeks where after, he completely stopped bringing her up at all. So of course i asked him about it, to which he brushed off each time. This got me curious, and i know what i did was wrong but i snooped through his phone and found them chatting.

      "\n",
      "On my end, i can see why he felt attracted to her and that was because she complimented him quite a bit and noticed little things about him, which i at that point didn't really do. After numerous talks he's noted the following:\n",

      "•They only chatted for a month before breaking it off before it got any more serious\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while now, and he constantly tells me that I’m “hot.” While I appreciate the compliments, they always feel centered around my body and come off as sexual.

      "We studied at the same campus, so we spend our time together a lot. In the first few months of our relationship, we meet in the evening after class almost every day to sometimes play sports together, or go out somewhere or just chill and watch movies in the campus. Then every night we’d be on the phone to chitchat until one of us fall asleep.\n",

      "But recently he’s been picking up games again. We still spend time together a lot. He’d still invite me to our evening meet-ups, and we still call each other every night.

At first I was being the understanding girlfriend and said it’s okay, but I’ve been falling asleep waiting for him to finish waaay more often now.\n",

      "He sometimes would check if I’m mad at him for playing games more often now. But I’m generally not very good at expressing what I want lol. I’d tell him “i don’t wanna stop you from doing things that you love”. I really mean that, but he has to know when to stop playing. Like, I don’t mind if he play video games more, but can’t he stop around the time I usually fall asleep? This is what I feel inside but I’m embarrassed to ask him this. I don’t wanna interrupt him mid-game and ask him to stop. I want HIM to stop playing because “oh, she’s about to fall asleep so if I don’t stop now, we’d not talk for the whole night”.

Plus I can’t really lash out at him for not spending time with me, because he DOES spend his time with me. I just miss our daily nighttime chats.

But then I’d feel terrible too if he stop playing completely because of me. AGHH WHY AM I SO COMPLICATED??? I’ve never feel so conflicted before.

      "Body text: My wife \\[33F\\] and I \\[35M\\] have 3 kids (ages 1,7,9) and are on a single income in a Low to Medium cost of living city. I work full-time and she's a SAHM. My wife quit her job shortly after our first child was born. She's always insisted on \"separate\" finances so we don't have joint bank accounts, credit cards, etc. She's a 100% beneficiary on all our savings and retirements accounts and we file taxes jointly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After taxes, mortgage, car payments, bills, after school programs, HSA and Roth, we're left with about $3500 per month. I send my wife $1500 for personal use, groceries, and most of the kids' expenses like clothes, snacks, school supplies. Out of the remaining $2000, I send $500 to my elderly parents, and usually spend the rest on miscellaneous expenses, vacations, or large purchases or invest it. I handle all the household finances and bills, and she manages her own CC bills. I've offered to \"combine\" our finances with full transparency, but she prefers the privacy and autonomy as is. Also she's also not very organized with finances, whereas I keep detailed budgets and spreadsheets.\n",

      "This has been our arrangement for several years. It was working well, until recently. She's hinting that she's always short on money and unable to pay her CC bills. She hasn't asked for me to send her more money per month, but she's starting to demand I send her half of any extra money that comes in, like our tax refund ($2000) and my quarterly bonus ($5000). She also pressured me into giving sister a large wedding gift. I told her I'll gladly contribute, but not all of it. I asked her if she had any savings and she got upset and called me stingy. We do have money tied up in investments and crypto, but I would rather not sell unless we absolutely have to.\n",

How should we improve our financial relationship and ease some of the tension?\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. At the beginning of our relationship she moved in early due to problems with her roommates. After moving in she rarely helped with house work. At the beginning this was excused due to her working more. However, when the roles swapped and I started working more than her, her workload around the house didn't change. Now she works around 18 hours a week plus university and I work 28 hours a week plus university. She might help out around the house 1 day of the week but she doesn't cook so if I don't feel like cooking, we waste money on takeout. She doesn't do the dishes because the water is yucky and doesn't take the bin out because it smells. She only does the washing when she runs out of clothes but I run out of clothes before her so I am constantly doing it. She leaves her clothes out on the floor as well as her makeup. She has a car but doesn't drive so if she wants to go somewhere I end up getting dragged along and because she doesn't drive I am the one constantly doing the shopping. Around once every two weeks she makes a comment about feeling bad about how she isn't helping out around the house and she will start helping but she never does. On top of this, when we moved house, I packed up 90% of the house. Moved it all except for the large items which I needed help to carry. I unpacked 90% of it. We needed to get a new lounge so I was tasked with it because no one responds to her on market place and when I hadn't she would constantly get upset at me but not do anything about it herself. When we have to contact the real estate it is my job to do so because my name is first on the lease but at the previous property where her name was first, it was still my job. \n",

      "One her closest friends was her ex-boyfriend who told me before we got together that he was still in love with her and would do what ever it took to get her back. When i talked to her about him she said he was just a friend and didn't want to cut him off even after he admitted he still had feelings for her whilst we were dating. After about six months of being together and me making my wishes about him know, she finally stopped talking to him. Since moving from our home town she has not made an effort to meet up with friends who live near us as well as the new friends she has made since moving here, whilst saying how she has no friends here and is lonely sitting at home all day. Her out of town friends that come to visit us are constantly making jokes at the expense of me and my family and I have made it know that i don't want to be around these people but she wants me to come to her friends events because they are her friends and they need to like me. On top of these friends, her family is also making jokes at the expense of me but according to her its just how the show there love. Recently we have been making visits to she her family and due to the distance, I have put in time off for a day each week because I have to drive. So ill drive her the 3 hours each way for a day trip, or drop her off and let her spend the night and then after an 8 hour shift drive the 3 hours each way to pick her up. \n",

      "A ongoing issue in out relationship has been our intimacy. At the beginning we would be intimate once a day or more but as time went on I gradually pulled back, initially it was because I couldn't keep up. When she told be this, she said i should go on testosterone or get a pill. Now we are intimate 1-2 times a week because I am very conscious about the fact that I'm not ready to be a father and she would keep the child if she got pregnant. I would be comfortable with eliminating sex but she isn't so I cut back. I have told her my reasoning and she is always saying she is on birth control and she needs more. Due to this she has been very pushy about this topic and is guilting me into it by saying i am not fulfilling her needs so we are having intimacy even when I don't want it.\n",

      "This week, she got very upset that I didn't put in the time off to see my mother for her birthday. My mother lives 3 hours away in the town that we both grew up in. We haven't been back in a few months so my GF hasn't been able to meet up with her friends and family that live there. She yelled at me because I didn't put this time off and went on to say that my mother is going to get mad at her because they talk more than I talk to my mother. It has to be noted that I don't particular like my mother as she tried to paint my father as the bad guy after their divorce and has cause my sister and father not to be on speaking turns. My father on the other hand has never said anything bad about my mother and even stops us from saying anything bad about her. She knows this but is still trying to force me to have a relationship with my mother but my girlfriend doesn't have a relationship with her mother. \n",

      "Body text: For context, we are both in our junior year of HS and have been dating for around 3 months now. Sometimes when we talk about our future, it seems she has her life/career completely laid out for the next 10 years, planning to work in an extremely high paying job. She's very hardworking and talented too. I grew up in a middle class family with a working father and stay at home mother, and I always admired my dad for supporting us and wanting to do that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, I have a deep fear of not being the \"breadwinner\" in the future and being the one being provided for. I hate it. It's not that I'm intimidated by her potential successful career, but I've always looked forward to having someone rely on me and being able to buy things for my partner. It gives me value and makes me happy because I made her happy, so not being the one to do that crushes me. I also don't have any other redeeming qualities. I can't seem to stop myself from overthinking about it because I don't even know what I'm feeling, and it clouds my mind every day. Am I thinking too far ahead? What am I supposed to tell her? Why can't I just be happy for her?? I'm aware that I have no control over what she wants to do or how much money she'll make and she's not even doing anything wrong but every time I talk to her that's all I think about now. I really like her and everything else is perfectly fine, so I would rather not break things off cause of my childish fears.\n",

But im getting really mixed feelings about this because i have brought it up a few times and wanted to know why, but she always says its because her whatsapp or instagram is glitching and because shes always on do not disturb, personally i find it hard to believe because when she was on a school trip where phones were prohibited, her whatsapp didnt glitch and showed when she finally went offline and whenever we go out, sometimes i take a glance and her phone isnt on DnD. I hope im not overthinking or insecure, its jus that im very conflicted in what im seeing and would like more opinions on this!\n",

It is difficult for me to ask outright for sex and I find talking about it pretty uncomfortable, but I absolutely love having sex with my bf. This excites me because of how much I resented and avoided sex with my husband; I thought I was asexual and I grieved that. \n",

      "I know I’m fat. I’ve gained a lot of weight over the years due to a medical condition. Exercise, eating healthy, all of it doesn’t matter as due to this medical condition, the weight is impossible to lose. I’ve had doctors even tell me I’d have near an impossible time losing weight.\n",

      "I’ve spent years hating myself because of my body. I’ve struggled with ED disorders because of it. I’ve missed out on experiences because I didn’t want people to “see me”.

Thanks to her I've traveled more than I ever have and have moved into a bigger home with her. We share the same values, sense of humor and interests, and it's just crazy just how much she matches with me in terms of what we like to do. \n",

      "I currently work as a physician assistant in Ortho so I make a good chunk of the finances which I'm perfectly fine doing. She has a stay at home job that she does as well as pick up shifts from a hotel or fancy restaurant serving people to get some extra money. We have a decent balance in terms of finances and she definitely pulls her own weight in contributing to the monthly payment and making sure there's always food at home. She always makes sure there's dinner at the end of the day and really goes out of her way to make sure we have healthy meals throughout the day. Not that she's obligated, but she even sometimes makes me breakfast and usually makes us dinner. Also while I'm away at work she makes sure the house is clean and does our laundry. \n",

She's always struggled with being comfortable driving on the highway and also has a hard time motivating herself to go to the gym (shes been making an effort but usually comes with me as motivation). We recently went on a trip with her family and her mom and sister mentioned that she's always been kind of lazy. I had a talk with her in the car and she said she was really bothered by it and is trying her best to better herself but just struggles. I asked what long term goals she had and she couldn't really bring one up besides starting a family one day and continuing to support me. She otherwise doesn't have many hobbies but this doesn't really bother me too much as I enjoy us spending time watching Netflix together or playing video games. \n",

She values me, cares for me, and makes sure that I know I'm loved. It's almost everything I could've asked for but still wonder if I'm potentially ignoring something that shouldn't be ignored.

      "Body text: For context, I’m 22 and currently living with my parents. I moved back in a couple of years ago for medical reasons, and while I’m now in a position to move out, it’s a process that takes time and planning. I’m working on it with a potential roommate, but I’m not in a rush since my parents are okay with me staying for now.\n",

      "I also don’t have a car at the moment because I can’t afford one yet. My new job will allow me to save up for one, but in the meantime, my boyfriend has been giving me rides. He offered to do so, and I always assumed it was okay, but clearly, it’s become a source of resentment for him. I fully understand how giving me rides could feel burdensome. It’s time-consuming and inconvenient, and he’s under no obligation to do it. If this was his way of setting a boundary, I would have respected that. But instead, it came out in a way that felt more like shaming than communicating a need.\n",

      "On a Wednesday when we were both off work, he picked me up so we could go work out together. We’d been texting throughout the day, and everything seemed fine. But when he picked me up, he was clearly upset. When I asked what was wrong, he started bringing up how I needed to get my life together. He began by saying he was tired of giving me rides and wished I could just drive myself. I completely get that frustration, and I was ready to have a calm conversation about it. But then he started getting more heated, saying things like how I’m lazy and how he’s tired of being my “taxi.”\n",

He’s explicitly told me he doesn’t want to live together, so it felt unnecessary and unfair to attack me for something that isn’t even his concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I tried to explain that I was aware of these issues and actively working on them, but he wasn’t listening. I asked him to calm down because it was starting to feel less like a conversation and more like an attack. That only seemed to make him angrier. He began yelling over me, interrupting me every time I tried to speak, and eventually told me that I was a burden and that he wasn’t happy with me. He said he didn’t want to be with me and that he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. It was a complete escalation from where the conversation had started, and I was left feeling blindsided and hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t speak for a few days, and during that time, I was left feeling completely confused and rejected. On Saturday, he asked me to come over, and I thought we’d have a proper conversation about what happened. Instead, as soon as I walked in, he started crying, hugging me, and trying to initiate sex. I told him I wasn’t ready to be intimate until we talked things through, but since there were other people around, we agreed to wait until the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, we went to a museum and finally talked. He said he felt overwhelmed by how much he thinks I rely on him and that he felt like he was carrying the weight of my responsibilities. I can understand feeling that way regarding the car situation. It’s a lot to always be the one driving and adjusting his schedule to accommodate me, and that’s valid. But he also made it sound like my entire existence was weighing him down, which felt like he was placing blame on me for things I can’t immediately fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel like I treat him as a father figure or that I rely on him more than a typical partner would. But the way he expressed it made me feel like he sees me as a dependent child rather than an equal. I’ve taken steps to address what he brought up, but I’m still struggling with how he communicated it, how quickly things escalated, and how extreme his reactions were. I don’t know how to navigate his expectations without feeling invalidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend and I had a major argument that almost ended our relationship. It started when he told me he felt overwhelmed and said I was a burden to him. He brought up feeling frustrated about giving me rides since I don’t have a car yet and criticized me for still living with my parents, even though he’s the one who offered to drive me and my living situation doesn’t directly affect him. The conversation escalated quickly he started yelling, calling me names, and said he wasn’t happy or attracted to me anymore. We didn’t talk for a few days, then he asked me to come over, immediately got emotional, and tried to initiate sex before we’d even talked things through. The next day, we finally discussed it, and he said he felt like I relied on him too much, almost like a child. I understand how the car situation could feel burdensome, but I feel like he took it way too far and expressed himself in a really hurtful way. Now, I’m trying to figure out how to address his concerns without feeling invalidated or belittled.\n",

      "I'm currently facing a very difficult time as my BF (32M ) of 5 years cheated on me (F26) and i found out about it back in 2022. He apologized and accepted his mistake and begged me to stay even though I told him that it would be impossible for me to trust him again but he asked for another chance and said I will make you trust me again i will change myself you will see. \n",

And in that fear, i have been holding onto him so tightly that i think i might have suffocated him. \n",

I havent developed any healthy outlet or way to self regulate myself. Im working on it now. I do become better for sometime but whenever the feeling of him being slightly distant starts to creep in, my mind goes straight to the what ifs. what if he is giving time to someone else thats why he is being unavailable and distant to me? what if he is talking to another girl? what if he leaves me for someone else? all these questions then lead me to ask him all sorts of questions and i make him swear that he is not lying. I realize now how hard it must be for him to deal with all this given his attachment style. he withdraws. I push him. the argument get bigger and worst. He flips that why cant you give me space when I need it. Then I beg him to come back, we talk things out and then the same painful cycle repeats. \n",

      "Title: I (30M) am struggling to respect or admire my girlfriend (29F) after learning more about her lifestyle and past — is this incompatibility or me being too rigid?\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been seeing my girlfriend for about six months. At first, I was really drawn to her energy — she’s warm, open, emotionally expressive, and genuinely kind-hearted. She was incredibly accepting of my past and showed me a level of patience and nonjudgment that I deeply respected. I wanted to build something meaningful together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But over time, I started to feel a quiet internal tension that kept growing. About three months in, she opened up about parts of her past she had initially lied about — her drug use, her drinking habits, the lifestyle she lived up until shortly before we met. It wasn’t just experimentation in her early twenties — it was part of her recent life. And while she told me she’d stopped since being with me, I couldn’t stop feeling conflicted about it. What also bothered me was how she often spoke about being drunk or high in a lighthearted, almost glorified way — like telling funny stories about blacking out or doing cocaine. It made it seem like these weren’t just mistakes she learned from, but part of a lifestyle she still identified with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also struggled to find things I genuinely admire about her in terms of growth or achievement. She doesn’t seem driven or motivated, doesn’t work hard, doesn’t cook, and is often late. She values “fun” but not the work or structure that makes it sustainable. When we talk, most of her stories revolve around partying or being high. I don’t think I’ve ever heard her talk about a goal or project she’s working toward.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often drinks with the explicit intention of getting drunk, and she’s blacked out more times than I’m comfortable with. She’s gotten hurt, made poor choices, and still tells those stories with pride or amusement. We recently went to a party together, and being around that scene with her and her friends—the drugs, the partying—it just pushed me over the edge emotionally. I left feeling like I didn’t even like who she was anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I value discipline, structure, accountability, and growth. I’ve worked hard to become someone I can respect — and I’m looking for a partner whose values and lifestyle align with that. I know no one is perfect (including me), and I don’t expect anyone to come without a past. But what I’ve realized is that it’s not just the past itself that bothers me — it’s how close it still feels to the present, and how much I still see it shaping her identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her as a person, or whether I was initially more in love with the idea of her — the version she presented early on, before these truths came to light. The more I sat with it, the more it felt like I was mentally and emotionally carrying a mismatch — trying to bridge the gap between my values and hers, between what I hope for in a long-term partner and what I’m actually experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe people can and do change. But I’ve also learned that for me, admiration and shared principles are foundational. When those start to erode, so does my emotional connection. And I’ve started to wonder if I’m trying to force compatibility where it just doesn’t exist. Since then, I’ve been struggling internally. I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her, or whether I’m just clinging to the hope that she’ll eventually become the person I thought she was. I’ve started feeling emotionally disconnected, and even a bit resentful. I also wonder whether I’m being too rigid or idealistic but I can’t shake the discomfort. Should I break it off if I don’t feel that I can respect her?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I’ve been dating someone who initially lied about their past with drug use. Her past (and recent) choices around drugs and partying conflict with who I thought she was and drug use was a dealbreaker for me. I’m torn between wanting to be accepting, and feeling like I’m losing respect and admiration in the process. Unsure if I’m being too rigid, or if this is just an honest incompatibility.\n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone! I’m F20 and my Boyfriend is M20; we met on vrchat (nobody make fun of this, please) and met up 3 months into our relationship and things have been going great ever since! We’re now past the 2 year mark and I absolutely adore him. We live about 2 and a half hours from each other at the moment and tend to see each other at least for a week each month; he even went on a vacation to California with my family and I this past winter! Though since he left in early January, I haven’t seen him. My parents keep telling me in order to see him, I need to clean my depression room. (I have a new bedroom now. But my old one is still…a mess. 4+ years worth of clutter and clothes) and I physically cannot clean it without him. The only time it was ever even clean is when he helped me; but after my family figured out he helped, they banned him from going inside the room. Currently going on 4 months without seeing him and it’s really getting to me. I’m autistic and he is genuinely my comfort person. I’m in dire need to see him and they just won’t allow it. I feel so stuck. He missed my birthday, missed some pretty important life events of mine, all because I can’t clean the damn room. Any help, tips, or just advice is overall appreciated. Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day :))\n",

      "Body text: This is something I’ve struggled with a decent bit, but I don’t know how to fix it. Me and my girlfriend got together our senior year of high school. We are long distance now, going to different colleges, and things are going great. The thing that eats away at me though is that I am not her first. During her junior year, she dated another man for a couple weeks where she experienced most of her firsts other than things like PIV sex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since learning about that, I have felt extraordinarily jealous. I am not upset with her, but extremely envious of the experiences that her ex got to experience with her. I am jealous that her best kiss, her best date, her best sexual experiences will all be held with him. I know that she hates him immensely and he treated her extremely badly, yet it still eats away at me that *he* was the one to hold all of those amazing experiences with her back when they were exciting and special. \n",

      "Title: I (18M) love my girlfriend (19F), but I’m struggling with her weight gain and don’t know how to talk to her about it anymore\n",
      "Body text: Hi Reddit,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend (we’re both 19 now and about 160cm tall). I’ve loved her deeply all this time, and I still do. But I’m at a point where I’m feeling conflicted, frustrated, and unsure how to handle things.\n",
      "When we started dating, she weighed around 58kg (~128lbs), and I was totally fine with that. I’ve never been someone obsessed with looks. But over the years, she’s gained a lot of weight — now she’s about 86kg (~190lbs). I’m not trying to fat-shame her, and I understand that bodies change, but this is starting to affect her health. She’s experiencing knee pain and struggles with things like getting up or moving around easily.\n",
      "She’s been doing what looks like intense workouts (4 times a week) for about 1 year, and from what I can tell, she’s really trying. But despite that, she keeps gaining weight. Every time I try to bring it up — gently, I swear — she gets really upset. Last time, I mentioned that maybe she could try eating just a little less, and she broke down crying and called me an asshole. She said I could never understand what it's like because I’m naturally thin (I weigh 45kg and actually struggle with gaining weight myself).\n",
      "She’s seeing a nutritionist, and she says she’s eating normally and not starving herself. But to be honest, I don’t know how to make sense of it — because if she were truly burning more calories than she consumes, she shouldn’t be gaining weight, right? I’ve tried to explain this without sounding cruel, but it always ends with her in tears or calling me an idiot who just doesn’t understand.\n",
      "So here’s the truth: I feel guilty because I still love her, but I’m also less and less physically attracted to her. Sometimes when I see her undress, I feel kind of grossed out, and that makes me feel like a horrible person. We still have regular sex, and it hasn’t affected that part of our relationship — yet. But I’m worried that over time, this lack of attraction will become a bigger issue.\n",
      "Am I a bad person for feeling this way? For having physical preferences? For being honest — even gently — about my concerns for her health and our relationship?\n",
      "I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t talk to her about this without making her feel terrible, no matter how carefully I try. And I don’t want to hurt her — I just want to be honest and find a solution together.\n",

      "Body text: My partner (M20) broke some shocking news yesterday, and very openly expressed how he struggles with watching porn. We have been together 2 years. He shared this has always been a struggle of his especially before us. He wishes they could stop, and finds himself in a cycle of shame every time.

      "Title: My [37M] Wife [36F] Wants Me to Leave Because I Keep Avoiding Hard Conversations\n",
      "Body text: My wife and I have had a rocky marriage for the last 16 years, mainly because of some situations I have caused. We started dating at 18, and both of us come from broken homes and we got married at 21 and had our daughter not long after getting married. Throughout our marriage, I have had issues with planning long term, dealing with impulsivity and avoiding difficult conversations. My wife has given me grace, and given me chances to fix things which I have tried to do, but usually have not met her complete requirements to which she then makes concessions for me. It has also always been really important to my wife that we move out of our hometown, and it is something that we have planned to do since we got together, but has always fallen through usually because of my lack of planning or effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my work is relocating us cross country in a few months, and I have let plans fall behind. We also have my daughter going away to school for the first time in a few months, and the perfect storm of big events that require planning is causing us to need to have some really important conversations which I keep avoiding. I know that these conversations will ultimately lead to fights over money and how good we are doing, my lack of financial planning, etc. Now, she wants me to leave the house because I have kept pushing them out so far, and all I want to do now is to just have them. Get it all out and have the conversations so we can either move forward together, or apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue now is she doesn't even want to talk to me about those things, she just wants me out. I don't know what to do anymore. I really want to work it out with my wife, I want her to move with me and I really want to make her feel fulfilled, but even if I can get her to have the conversation with me now, I feel like I will just end up disappointing her with the outcome and causing an even bigger more volatile fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also been struggling as I have been in counseling the last few months, and recently got diagnosed with ADHD. Through talking with my counselor and researching, it really seems like a lot of my relationship issues are common with ADHD, and that is throwing me emotionally. I haven't gotten effective medication yet, and I don't want to use this to excuse everything, but it's just hard to deal with.\n",

      "**TLDR: I have a history of not planning long term, and that has caused my wife stress and she now wants me to leave because I am avoiding hard conversations about our plans to move cross country. I know I need to have these talks now, and I want to, but she just says it's too late. How can I approach this?**\n",

      "We’re both night owls, but she stays up later than I do despite working earlier. I have a sleep disorder, suffer from frequent nightmares resulting in poor sleep and am a light sleeper. She’s a heavy sleeper. So I’m woken up and then bothered roughly every 5-8 minutes by alarms due to the convo of snoozed ones and new ones going off. Usually I end up being the one to finally get her to wake up. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been years of this and I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve talked with her about it and she just says that it’s hard for her to wake up and it’s not like I have to be up until later as if my poor sleep doesn’t affect the rest of my day. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve considered sleeping in a different room but that upsets her and frankly I don’t think I should have to move bedrooms to get better sleep. I doubt she’d wear a smart watch so I don’t think a vibrating alarm will work. Moving her alarm across the room won’t do anything as the alarms don’t wake her up, only me.

      "My husband and I love each other very much but he has always been way more affectionate than me.

I see his point and I understand where he is coming from, but after I put our baby to bed, all I want to do is just relax and have some fun (watch TV, browse on my phone, play game, etc). At that point, I’ve been affectionate with our baby all day long, I don’t have any more room for affection.

      "Title: Husband said “why did I ever marry you” out of nowhere…\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "I (23F) have been married to my husband (27M) for a little over two years, together for 5 overall. When we got married, he knew I was bisexual and had shared my past experience (only 1) with a girl. For reference, it didn’t go past the kissing stage, and our time together was veryyy brief (about 2/3 weeks). I shared this part of me to my husband BEFORE we got married, and knew it was something that made him uncomfortable but he still accepted me and loved me for who I was. Or so I thought. Over time, he has randomly brought it up in random situations, which I never found “bad” in a way since I was just like ok whatever he is just being annoying, but since we would never fight or argue about it, I didn’t see it as a problem when he did bring it up. I have had one serious conversation with him about this topic with him and let him know that I love him and that i chose to marry HIM. that I would never cheat on him, and if i ever did, it would probably be with a guy, not a girl. I also made it clear to him that if he could not accept me for who I am, we should not be together. I accept him for all his faults and defects (even though being anything but heterosexual isn’t a fault or defect) and God knows he isn’t perfect. I’ve forgiven him for looking at other girls a few times on his cellphone, and watching 🌽 when we had already said we wouldn’t do that in our relationship. I know the two situations aren’t comparable, but I brought it for the sake of argument. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, here’s the issue. Last night, we were having dinner while watching Friends on tv, and mind you, ever since we started watching that show together (he’s never seen it) he makes little comments out him turning out like Ross (who plays a divorced character becaUse his wife left him for a woman). I always ignore it or tell him to stop, but since he says it in such a lighthearted way, I never felt the need to argue or say much, as whenever this does happen, I usually will be like “babe stop, i love U” and that’s usually the end of that conversation. He doesn’t do it in a mean way but I can tell he is frustrated by my sexuality. lol. Ok, back to the story, A scene came up with Ross and his ex-wife (with her new wife) and he randomly looked at me with so much disgust and frustration and yelled “why did i marry you!!??” with his hands in the air in a frustrated form. I looked at him and was like wt??? and said “what?” I was genuinely confused cause like ???? We weren’t even having a conversation or anything, we were literally in the middle of dinner watching tv. I quickly caught on to what he was referring to in terms of his statement, and I instantly felt like shit. I told him he f’d up, and to not talk to me, and got up and went into our bedroom and cried. lol. He has said f’d up shit in the past but it’s usually during an argument after i’ve been a B**** for a while, but this hurt. It hurt more than it would have if it would have been said during and arguement. But no, he said it when we were peacefully having dinner. He looked so disgusted and frustrated at me when he said those words. Anyways, he followed me into our bedroom and started saying how if he knew I was bi before we got married (which he did) he wouldn’t have married me because he wouldn’t want to have people making fun of him for me being with a woman after us divorcing (him assuming that i would immediately get with a woman if we ever separated) I told him that if we ever did divorce, he should not care what I do after him. He spends his time saying how he doesn’t care about others opinions, so why does he suddenly care in that situation? It’s more like this hits his ego and makes him insecure I suspect. I let him know that i’m happy to accompany him to get a divorce if he isn’t able to accept me for who I truly am, and that if he is able to accept me, he needs to drop the subject and let it go, i am with him, not with anyone else. He should be focused on our marriage and not what I would or wouldn’t do in a hypothetical divorce. I told him he’s an id**t and that he is ruining our marriage by doing stuff like this, and said a few more things but quickly just told him to leave me alone, and that I did not want to speak to him for the moment. He said a few words but I honestly didn’t care to hear them and turned my back and fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t find him in our bed but sleeping on our couch. Which he has never done before in our 3 years of living together. I guess I just need advice on how to proceed. He is a great person and husband, he is very loving and kind, and is a very open minded person and is accepting of everyone’s sexuality (except mines i guess) but his words hurt me more than anything else he’s ever done or said in the past, and I don’t know if I can get over that. I feel so sad. He really hurt me. I don’t know how to move forward. This morning we barely spoke and neither of us said I love you before heading out. Advice? \n",

Last night, out of nowhere during dinner, he looked at me with frustration and yelled, \"Why did I ever marry you?\" It hurt deeply because it wasn’t in the heat of an argument—it was random and cruel. He later told me that if he had fully processed my bisexuality before marriage, he wouldn’t have married me, because he doesn’t want people to make fun of him if we divorce and I end up with a woman. I told him that he either needs to accept me as I am or we should split, and I went to bed upset. He slept on the couch, which he's never done before.

      "Title: My alcoholic bf of 9 years slept through my entire birthday and our plans\n",
      "Body text: As the title reads. I don’t have anyone who can relate to my situation so I’m posting it here. Im 33F and my bf is 36M. We have no kids but have 2 dogs and own a home together. I also have to add that currently he is NOT working and in between jobs atm. My birthday was 3 days ago and I’m STILL crying as we speak and so hurt by it, ugh. I’m not even big on birthdays, but considering how insanely busy my schedule has been for the past year (I’m a FT trade student, FT online student for my bachelor’s, and work 4 nights a week . I literally have no days off), I just wanted ONE day off work to relax and spend time with him. I thought the day we had planned was simple-I was going to my Saturday morning class and leaving by 11AM so we could go on a walk with our dogs and later go get ramen for dinner. In addition to this, I also asked if he could do the dishes that had been piled in the sink…Did any of that happen? Absolutely not, and I can’t believe I fooled myself to believe it would. \n",
      "\n",
      "This relationship was the best I’ve ever had in terms of our connection. It has felt so effortless and right until a few years ago where his alcohol problem started to quickly affect everything in our lives. Yes it’s a huge problem, he has lost every job he’s had due to attendance issues, it has bled into our relationship, and his promises with family or friends always end up with him flaking because he’s too hungover or want to stay home to get drunk. It’s like he knows he has a problem but doesn’t care enough at all to change it until shit hits the fan. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been with one foot the door for a while which he has been completely aware of but I always let shit go because I don’t like holding grudges and I love him, but now I’m starting to see the big picture and how little he values me. This time it IS different and as much as I want to get over it, I just can’t let this one go. I can’t keep fooling myself to believe things will one day change when they’ve been faulty for years. Up until my birthday, I had no idea that was the last straw. The one day I was really excited for and even rescheduled with my parents was ruined because he decided to sleep all day until 5pm. He was also vomiting like crazy when he woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not saying I’m an angel, I have a tendency to say hurtful things when I’m upset and I’ve had my issues with alcohol (not even close to his extent) but I recognize when I’m fucking up and do my best to check myself. I just feel so hopeless now. I really thought I would be with this man for the rest of my life, but the fogginess is starting to clear up and I’m almost desperate at this point to get out. I’m tired of being an after thought along with our two dogs that HE wanted to adopt, but can’t even be bothered to walk them unless I bug him. He’s not the man I used to know and alcohol has consumed him. I reached out this his parents a few years ago, and they something similar to an intervention and he was actually doing good for a while, but sometimes old habits never die.  \n",

      "This is already super long. I just never thought I would be that woman in her mid thirties that has to start all over again. I really wanted kids, but I just don’t see that happening with him and let’s be honest, my time is ticking. This is so unfair. I am now having to uproot my life and sell my dream home due to his repeated lack of effort. The birthday was just the cherry on top of all the issues I’ve brushed off for so long. As heartbroken as I am, I’m also eager for a new chapter. I deserve so much better and this relationship has dragged me down for too long. . I wish I could forgive him, but I just can’t keep playing myself. Deep down inside I don’t think he can change, and I can’t keep living like this. Please tell me I’m making the right decision to leave? \n",

I feel like he doesn't know how to draw boundaries with her and one day, if we get married, he will bankrupt the two of us and our family trying to help her. I initially thought this may be an overreaction but the more and more I see this happening, the more I believe that it is completely possible.

      "Title: My (22F) boyfriend (22M) keeps letting his friend (24M)  come on our dates.\n",
      "Body text: UPDATE: I broke up with my ex (I’m gonna call him X) I went to where we agreed to meet up, and guess who he brought with him…you guessed it LIAM! I was very annoyed at this point, I told him I wanted to speak with him privately, and he brings fucking Liam. It’s very uncomfortable to break up with someone in front of their best friend, but I was too pissed, I told him “I said I wanted to speak privately“ he said “say it in front of Liam” eventually I just get annoyed and say “thats it! I don’t want Liam always here in our private life, on dates, everywhere“\n",
      "\n",
      "he basically said, remember what I told you about Liams circumstance, blah blah blah. I said something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck about what Liams going through right now, this is about me breaking up with you” meanwhile Liam is just standing there…looking confused? I’ll get back to this later. So we basically get into a fight in this park, and it gets to the point where I tell him that he manipulates me into not kicking Liam out of our dates, and about everything he told me Liam went through (like a brother to X, saved X life, dead mom, dad absent, no siblings, friends, or girlfriend)\n",
      "\n",
      "and then X looks like he got caught or something, and Liam gets angry saying like, “what did you tell her” this is all really funny and really awful at the same time. It turns out…NONE OF WHAT X TOLD ME WAS TRUE. Liam has a fiancée, has a REAL brother and sister, and his mom isn’t dead! So, anyway, definitely broke up with X. Like, 40 minutes later, Liam DMs me basically saying that X told Liam that I wasent ”comfortable“ being alone with X, and that he thought I *wanted* him to be on the dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, what? he said the reason why he agreed is because his fiancée is living in Europe to finish up her study abroad program, and he had nothing better to do. So X just flat out is a liar, glad I broke up with him, mad I got lied to, but oh well. This was honestly not a turn of events I was expecting, and I have to get it out somewhere. END OF UPDATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "|||EDIT: I called my soon to be ex boyfriend to meet up, and I’m gonna break up with him, I’m gonna tell him the exact reason honestly. I swear if Liam is there though, like, I’m not considering the possibility of not breaking up with him. It’s not even just because of Liam, its that he manipulates me into letting Liam come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, how we got into this predicament in the first place, is that my boyfriend just really likes his friend (Liam) he’s like a brother to him, he saved his life once, etc. But he’s on ALL our dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even brought one of my single friends on a date (so we could double) and Liam and her don’t date, so that failed. I’ve honestly asked my BF “why Liam is on our dates“ and he says that Liam is, lonely, has nobody else, and he has NO SIBLINGS or girlfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "but then my boyfriend kind of guilts me because (I know this sounds awful) Liam is the fucking package for guilt! His Mom died when he was young, then his Dad and him don’t talk anymore, so Liam just doesn’t have anyone else to talk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly think my boyfriend is guilt tripping me, and I don’t think I can do this relationship anymore. If nothing changes I’m leaving, this has gone on for 3 months.\n",
      "\n",

      "Now we’re in therapy, and I thought it was working. The last few weeks he’s worked less and made time to hang out with me and our baby more. He’s planned outings for us, taken us for bike rides, been home to cook dinner and do chores, and to watch the baby/toddler so I can have some me time or some friend time. It’s been so nice, and I mentioned to him that it made me happy, and thanked him for doing all this and making progress like we’ve talked about in therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On our walk this morning (and in our last therapy session) he said it made him disappointed that I was so happy with spending all the time together. He said he noticed that since he didn’t spend so much time doing extra work (he’d normally work 60+h/week but cut it down to closer to 50h/week) and hanging out with us more at home that I’d been happier, and that it just proved to him that he was the problem. He said that everything he wants is a problem, and when he doesn’t do or get what he wants then I’m happy. He said he’s happy spending time with me and our baby, but he’s disappointed too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Idk what to even think of this. I’m just hurt that I’ve dedicated so much time and energy to this relationship, to raising our baby (who is absolutely incredible), and that I’ve been told I shouldn’t be asking more of him, and that when we do spend time together he might be happy in the moment, but seems to look ack at it with regret and disappointment. Idk if he’s even happy to be with me. It doesn’t feel like it. It feels like he sees our relationship as holding him back, but when I try to tell him this he just says it feels like I don’t trust him. He says that lack of trust makes him not want to try. I tell him I’m trying to trust him, but he keeps doing this same pattern of spending time with us and then pulling away and then the cycle repeats. I don’t want him to pull back away, I don’t want him to tell me I shouldn’t need him. That’s when I can start trusting him again. Right now i’m always waiting for him to stop engaging with me and to just always be away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He struggles a lot with negative self talk and negative self image, so I try not to say negative things when describing what I want out of our relationship, or how I’m hurt. But then he just puts words in my mouth, feels self pity, shuts down and stops talking to me for a day or more.\n",

We were all having fun, drunk walking home, you know like just the normal drunk stuff. It's seriously still blurry and I don't even remember how it started. I had three drinks plus some buzz balls and I was so wasted. I just remember being on the couch with my best friends wife and I was leaning into her. She started to rub my chest and so did he. The way we were sitting on the couch has was positioned where I was in the middle, friends wife was on my left and friend was on my right. I really don't remember what happened, I know I was laughing. I don't even remember if I kissed either of them first, I don't think I did? Next thing I know we're all kissing WITH TONGUE?!?! And after they they started making out like less then an inch away from my face still touching me. Last thing I remember was I was in their bathroom and I could hear them having sex?!? I woke up in their bed this morning and I seriously am so freaked out. Now that I'm typing this out I don't even know if I initiated anything???? I'm in the guest bedroom now, they haven't woken up yet and I'm so lost. What do you even say when this happens? Do i apologize? Should they apologize? How do you even go about bringing this up? \n",

I kissed them a couple times actually, which is. Something. They both seem to have not minded! Y'all were also right, they've been more friendly and open! Im still a bit besides myself and will probably just lock this away in my brain. I don't wanna think about the implications right now.\n",

      "Body text: My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been dating for about four months and I truly adore him. We've always communicated well and haven't had any serious conflicts, but lately, something strange has been happening when I share my boundaries with him. As we've gotten closer and told each other more about ourselves, I've mentioned specific things that I like and don't like (i.e. I don't like when someone eats off of my plate). All of these boundaries are things I haven't felt the need to mention/express because they just haven't come up/posed an issue for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem I'm having now is that it seems like my boyfriend is going out of his way to do the things that bother me? I gave the food example because it is the one that he is giving me the most trouble over. I struggled with disordered eating pretty badly in my teens and early twenties (thanks, anxiety) and it's only in recent years that I've started to eat \"normally.\" That being said, I still struggle with portioning my food without counting calories and generally just eating intuitively, which is why I don't like it when someone eats off of my plate. If you've never had an eating disorder this may seem totally silly, but as I'm learning to trust my ability to eyeball correct portions and balanced meals, it just really bothers me and throws me off if someone is taking random bites off of what I served myself. One day, I will grow past this, but I'm kind of embarrassed by it, which is part of why I hadn't mentioned it to my boyfriend. And it hadn't come up at all! We always just enjoyed our food when we ate together and that was that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I've mentioned this boundary, my boyfriend either insists on taking bites from my plate or tries to eat off of the same plate and insists that we share a glass to drink out of. Sometimes he'll even try to get us to share a fork and pass it back and forth as we eat, which I'm not interested in doing. Yesterday, I went to eat a cookie and he took it out of my hand as it was on the way to my mouth and told me \"you don't need to be eating this.\" (I am in good physical shape and eat healthy 80% of the time -- not sure what the issue is, lol). I told him he wasn't going to dictate what I eat, and he apologized and said he was just trying to look out for my health. When I've confronted him about the food sharing, he's told me that it's just who he is and that it's selfish not to share food. (Also want to add here: it's not like I'm serving myself a plate of food and telling him he can't have any. There's always plenty to serve himself, he just wants to share/eat off of what I've put on my plate).\n",

      "Can someone please tell me how I can resolve this? All the other aspects of our connection are lovely (so much so that I do want to work through this and not just break up) and I just want to know how I can effectively communicate that this boundary (and others) are important to me?

My friend came over and she tried to pet her and she hissed and swatted and meowed raged then ran away. My boyfriend says that he does not want our guests to be afraid of the cat.

So I let people know not to interact with her and keep their distance and Daphne does the same.\n",

Ive tried showing him some Jackson galaxy videos but he says that that is my own biased opinion that I am shoving on him and does not want to learn because he doesn't believe it. He says that if he had a dog that growled and swiped at him that he would rehome the dog cause he respects me. I say that dogs are so different than cats and he has to learn how cats work.\n",

      "Well he has been trying to get on her good side - only by feeding them wet food at night. Nothing else. He has not tried to play with her (she loves to play) he has not tried to give her space. He says that it is his home and he has a right to feel at peace in it. He doesn't want to tip toe around the cat. Which I agree. I am just at a loss now of what to do because I've tried to help the situation with positive reinforcement and learning videos but he is not wanting to put in the effort because he doesn't believe it will work.\n",

I just don't know what to do because it would break my heart to rehome her and I feel like I would always have this guilt and animosity towards my boyfriend after the fact if I had to do that. Which I just can't do. He says he can't believe that I would disrespect him like that and not accomodate him in his own house by getting rid of her. \n",

      "Title: My bf [25M] refuses to marry me [22F] until we’re in our 50’s. I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend now for little over a year. But we ‘dated’ for about a year before becoming official. As the years have passed obviously conversations have popped up such as: what are both our thoughts on having children? when might be the appropriate length of time to move in together? And finally: marriage. We are both in this relationship for the long run, neither of us have ever dated casually and were only looking for long term relationships when we met. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6 months ago, the topic of marriage got brought up for the first time. Not because either of us want to get married now, but because I hope to one day get married in the future (next 10 years). My bf responded by saying something along the lines of: “only when I’m in my 50’s or later”, I thought he was joking, I really believed he was pulling my leg, until he made it really clear that he was being deadly serious. I was a little upset, but I wanted to understand why. His reasoning for doing so was because: he didn’t want to conform to “societies norms”, he said too many people “play by the book” and he believes people should break that, that our love shouldn’t be defined by a legally binding contract and that after people marry it all goes down hill from there. I explained that I didn’t view marriage that way, that I viewed marriage as two people making eternal promises to one another and that making vows and sharing a day where we can celebrate our relationship is very important to me (and of course ever since I was a little girl I’ve always fantasised about the dress and the ring). He replied with “if it’s a day you want I’ll throw you a party, I’ll get you a ring so you can tell people we’re married, but I’m not getting married until late”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this conversation we have had the same discussion about 5 times over the last 6 months. I always end up burying my head in the sand and hoping that by the next time he has changed his opinion, even if it’s only a little. But nothing has changed and he is very set on his opinion. I’ve even spoken to my mother and stepfather about it, who themselves didn’t marry until they were both 55, and they say it’s “just an age thing, he’ll grow out of it in the next 5 years”. But I don’t know if I can see that happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he’s being so so stubborn about it being so late in life. He still says he wants to marry, just not until then. Other information I do feel is important to add is that his parents are divorced (so are mine), and divorced when he was 17, from what I know it was quite a turbulent split and his mother claims she left it later than she should’ve. Other than that our relationship is strong, arguments are rare and I’m very close with his family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do love him very dearly, and I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but this is something I’ve always wanted to fulfil in my life and something I believe is a very important aspect of a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of staying with him for the rest of my life and never getting married has crossed my mind, I don’t want to be bitter or resentful in 30 years time because he deprived me of being able to marry while I get to watch all of my friends and family get married. But the thought of leaving him to find someone who can give me these things and living without him is just as bitter. \n",

Pretty much all the same thing, some just a little more hurtful than the others, some really motivating. Overall after reading all the comments I feel small, like really small… and stupid. I don’t know how I’ll be able to reply without getting really upset so I guess this is my reply. I feel incredibly insecure and honestly too embarrassed to reply to a lot of the comments here. So to those who do just want the best outcome for me I really appreciate your heartfelt advice and time. Thanks to everyone for your input, I never expected to get so many comments. \n",

      "Title: My gf wants too much sex!!\n",
      "Body text: I 29 M have been dating my gf 26 F for about 7 months. Things are going good nothing that we cant work through, but there is a pretty big difference in our sex drive and home comfortability. First off, she has had problems with addiction before and still has a lot of addictive tendencies, so with sex she even admits those tendencies play a role in her wanting it all the time. And i mean ALL the time. I myself am plenty happy with once or twice a week and really making it worth while. I get at the beginning of a relationship, it’s like how many times can we do it in a day? But after the relationship settles in, that game never stopped. I honestly think she would have it 5, 10, 20, times a day if i could keep up. Id like to say im exaggerating but i honestly dont know. We’ve done it 5 tomes a day on multiple occasions before, (and honestly at a certain point im using toys and foreplay and its really just all about her getting off cuz im done for the week/month.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I like sex as much as the next guy but damn…. It isnt even special anymore. Sex is nothing to me now, i actually decline her advances for sex probably 3 times as much as i will initate sexual advances of my own. We’ve had ok talks about it and its thankfully not turned into a fight, just a casual admission that she has a very high sex drive. But thats not all, she also has spent nearly every day at my apartment and when she is home she immediately gets naked and stays naked. I know, what kind of bf complains about that, but over time its had a negative affect. Im completely used to her naked body now. It’s also not special to me anymore. I dont mean that im not attracted to her, she is absolutely beautiful but 90% of the time i spend with her she is naked, and im not. I like to wear comfy clothes when im just chilling at home, and it feels awkward when we spend most of our time here filly naked and me fully clothed. Ive tried to avoid saying anything that would sound judgemental or controlling because thats not how i wanna be and its also not accurate to what im feeling. She started noticing when ever we go out and she puts something nice on, that recently those arethe times  when ive been giving her compliments on how nice she looks. And she thinks im getting used to her naked body, and i replied with “well yeah, i see you naked 10 times more than i see you with anything else on, i kinda am used to it, but that doesnt mean i dont think your beautiful, And im complimenting your outfit because you picked it out and you look good in it.” She didnt say anything but i knew she didnt like that answer and theres this incompatibility building between us that i can feel a fight coming on soon. The more i thought about it tho she was right. Even when shes just wearing the occasional comfy clothes at home with her unkempt hair all about, i find her super attractive and i realize that im just over exposed to her naked body that anything different is actually just new and interesting, and our relationship is oversaturated with sex to the point where other than the few great romantic nights in particular i honestly dont care about having sex with her. Not like im not enjoying it, and finishing if you know what i mean, but i dont care to start it and its even a chore sometimes and i have been turning her down frequently, which also leads to her just playing with herself while i am trying to go to sleep instead, and it is very awkward and i am wide awake during. I never thought too much sex would actually be bad for our sex life, but here we are and i can feel this thing starting to become a problem and i have no idea how to talk to her about it. What the hell do i do? \n",

      "TL;DR: my gf has a sex problem and it is oversaturating our lovemaking to the point of losing its spark. \n",

      "Edit: Just want to summarize. Im not complaining about having sex 4-5 times a week, that does seem like a very healthy sex life for us, i personally am good with 2 times a week that go all out, but its much more than 5 times a week, and thats with me turning her down as well, and i must add that we rarely have quickies you guys. Not bragging but i work out, i run, i eat good, i take supplements, and i have good stamina, so our sex can last pretty long each time. also, shes on meds that can take a little more effort for her to climax, so im not being lazy here. It’s genuinely alot of work some weeks and sex shouldnt ever be work. \n",

      "Title: Boyfriend made me uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to handle this\n",
      "Body text: I (27F) am dating this guy (29M)—he puts in effort into me, great career, kind, we get along. The other day, we had a somewhat serious convo on the phone. I asked him what we were, and he was very hesitant on comitting and didn't want a label which tbh wasn't a great feeling... but I go over to his house anyways where he cooks me an amazing dinner from scratch, then afterwards we go to his room and he asks me what I would like to do. I pick movie, but he tries making moves on me and I say “I’m really not in the mood for anything physical.” He then asks why, I just state that I’m not feeling it I would just like to relax and watch movie. He doesn’t like this. He keeps asking why, if I’m upset, if something is bothering me, if the reason is because I am upset. He pins me down so he’s on top of me, and he starts cackling like he kept laughing while thrusting his hips against mine and pinning my arms down so I can’t move. He says that’s it’s too coincidental that I’m not in the mood the same day we had a somewhat heavy phone call, and he tells me he thinks there’s more to it than me just not being in the mood. I kept saying not in the mood and that’s it.. I then say “how would you know there’s more than that?”and then he got really close to my ear and whispered “because I know.” Super uncomfortable, but I’m still pinned and he got close to my other ear to whisper and then I yell. He backs off, and goes “woah there you freaked out on my for a second there, then laughed.” He says “someone is telling you to do this. Who? Let me see your phone, specifically the messages between you and your best friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was leaving, he then asks me if something is wrong in a calmer manner.. but then he said “you not wanting s*x is OK, and I was respectful and backed off.” But that’s not what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ghosted him because of how creeped out I was. Then 2 days later he sends me a 5 paragraph essay about he he cherishes me and wants me to be his girlfriend, and that he regretted not making me his girlfriend sooner. I say no, and we have a phone call where I tell him I don't want to date him because he pinned me down. He claimed that he didn't know that I was uncomfortable, and that he was just playing around and thought something was going on with me so he was just trying to figure out what was going on. He said he had a different experience and had no idea he made me uncomfortable and that he was respectful and didn't push things further. He said he really wasn't trying to have s*x with me and that I took his intentions the wrong way. He didn't apologize so I just hung up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he kept messaging me, asking for another call. He kept saying that he would hate to end what we have over a simple unintentional misunderstanding, that he cherishes me and only wants to treat me with kindness. I told him I'm not interested yet he keeps texting me asking to talk things through, saying that he had no idea that he made me uncomfortable and is sorry.\n",
      "Should I give this another chance??\n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have been together for a few years. He grew up in a safe environment compared to me where he had loving parents that took care of him. I grew up in an unstable household (poverty, abusive father, etc). This basically shaped my life as the eldest daughter who had to grow up fast. When I sought out my partner, I thought it was all green flags that he had such an amazing family and supportive environment. \n",

I am a person who has overcome significant hardship to get to where I am now (poverty, abuse, very difficult career field). I am also really good at dealing with things under pressure and I consider myself extremely resilient. On the other hand, I find myself comparing my experience to his and feeling resentful that he is so fragile at dealing with all this. I get that we both have very different upbringings.

I’ve been frustrated with it as there is little that I can do besides talk him through it. And the other issue is I find myself often in my “masculine” energy where I can’t really depend on him and that’s not something I want to be all the time. I want to be able to feel like I’m being taken cared of or at least that there is a balance. I need to reiterate that I don’t want to leave my man. I love him sincerely.

For context, her divorce was due to infidelity on her ex-husband’s part. Mine was due to alcoholism on my ex-husband’s part. It was just a coincidence that it was within a year of each other. This led to a lot of crying together and lot of healing together, and we re-entered the dating world around the same time. The next couple of years were full of a lot of fun and tough lessons about relationships and partnerships and dating and love. This was stuff we spoke about constantly and had learned a lot of great/important lessons. \n",
      "She met a boy and dated him for a year. He wasn’t the one, nobody loved him, but we let her work through it. Definitely had some serious conversations, but trusted her to make the right choice for herself. She does finally break up with him and is in a very peaceful place. Within a week she goes on first date with a new guy. A set up through mutual friends (38M). She felt like it was too soon, but also wanted to just get back out there. They’ve now been dating five weeks and are engaged, to be married to summer. In total, they will have been together approximately three months before they’re fully married. I’ve only met him once. He does seem by all accounts to be a good man.\n",
      "This just feels insanely fast and insanely irresponsible. They both have two children each from their prior marriages, ranging in ages 9 to 14. I genuinely don’t understand what the rush is. The only context I can provide is that they both leaned heavily into their Christian faith post divorce, and I think that maybe accelerating the timeline for different reasons? If you ask them, why they’re moving by so fast they will just say that they are in love. \n",
      "How do I strike a balance between honesty and tough love and support for my best friend? What do I say? Do?\n",

For one, I have 2 animals of my own and he has 2 large animals. The size difference already worries me a bit despite them getting along and being around each other here and then. The second thing, I am purchasing a home and he is expecting to move in. The thought has always floated around but I’ve never told him a hard no.

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for four years. I’m 32 and he’s 30. He was my first love—the first man I gave myself to emotionally and physically.

      "Body text: I(21M) had my mom pass away from cancer 7 years ago. My mom was diagnosed with cancer and moved to another country for her treatment, so my dad and mom were separated for about 5 years before she passed away. So it was during the duration where she was away that my dad had an affair. Now yesterday, my brother(28M) and I got a text from the person he had an affair with (I don't know the name or the age), with the picture of the daughter he had and how old she was, and it was my dad that had her send the text to both of us. He admitted that it was a mistake, but I don't know how far that I can trust that statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked from the fact that my dad had commited such an act of infidelity, since he looked like just a loving and caring husband. When my mom couldn't move much, he was the person that took her to the bathroom, gave showers, fed her, and was always beside her until her last moments on Earth. He was also a great father to me and my brother, and always had his top priority be his two sons.\n",

      "Title: MIL is pressuring us (34 M/F) to move in with her and it’s ruining my marriage\n",
      "Body text: UPDATE: A conversation last night pretty much confirmed my suspicion that he's planning to force a move when his mom visits next month. He has asked me to empty our storage unit before she arrives \"to prove to her that we are okay\" which makes zero sense. Then he dropped \"if we didn't have all the extra stuff we could just pack up and go try living with her and see what it's like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's my understanding that I can't get a court order to prevent him from taking the kids out of state and I'd only be able to file an emergency order to return them after they were taken if he attempted to establish residence with them elsewhere. It's either that or file for divorce and add a provision that he not be able to leave the state with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I texted MIL telling her clearly that we do NOT want to live with her and that I just want to be on the same page so she isn't prepping her house and getting her hopes up for no reason. She stopped talking to both my husband and I. She's been pretty communicative but no contact with either Of us all day which is weird since lately it's been daily. A lot of weird things are suddenly making sense, like her insisting she would take my kids when she visits so we can have a day alone, which would never happen because they don't even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am alerting the rest of their family in her area that she is doing this so if they do try to take the kids the rest of the family can be on the lookout for them and let me know where they are. I am close with his dad and stepmom who I haven't said anything to about this up to this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to remain firm and if he continues to push I will tell him I am filing for divorce if he continues this. I don't want to. He is a good man and we are very happy together and I want to believe in the face of losing me and potentially our kids he will come to his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you everyone for your thoughts and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR\n",
      "MIL was no/minimal contact for years and very suddenly after loss of the last family she had is pressuring us to move in with her with our two kids 1800 miles away from everything they have ever known. My husband wants to go and I do not. It’s ruining our relationship. What rights do I have if I do not want to move my family across the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief history. MIL and I had a good relationship until we moved out of state after 6 years. She cut contact with my Husband for many months and it took years for them to establish a relationship again. During that time we got married, had a baby, and she still refused contact with me because I \"took her baby\" from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was 4 years ago. She lost her brother a few months ago and he was the last of her family. She doesn't have familial relationships with anyone except a very distant relationship with her brother's 2 kids. This is by her doing. She has largely cut her other son out of her life because she doesn't like his new girlfriend and feels she is taking him from her (sounds familiar). So suddenly she is reaching very intensely out of the blue to establish a relationship with me and my daughter who she has had no contact with her entire life. Never sent a gift or a card or called to talk to her (she's 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she is saying she wants us to come live with her. We are 1800 miles apart. She wants us to live with her until we find work and a home near her. To me, it feels like she's grasping at the last shred of family she has left realizing that she has no one else. She is enchanting my husband with how magical this will be. She will babysit, buy all our food, cook for us, give us date nights whenever we want, we can live in her 10 acres and have lots of space for our two kids and our dogs. It all sounds great except.. we live here. Our jobs are here. Our life and all our kids have ever known is here. There is no reason to leave other than her suddenly deciding this is what needs to happen. She literally went from not talking to me for 4 years to texting me \"I love you\" every day and telling me how she's getting her house ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing a HUGE problem between my husband and I because he LOVES this idea but before this we were happy living where we are. We have goals and plans that are based here. One of our kids is in school here, I'm in college here, we have a good program here that allows anyone to get a free degree up to a bachelors. I can finish school without owing any money. There are many reasons I want to stay where we are. The same reasons we chose to live here in the first place. But now my husband is caving under this delusion of a beautiful carefree life with his mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to resolve this. I'm not moving my family across the country on a whim just because my MIL decided she's lonely and he's set that it would be great for our family. She is set to visit for the first time next month after saying for YEARS she would NEVER come here and previously said she would come up to help us move everything in with her. I kind of feel like they are planning to twist my arm when she is here and try to force moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I protect myself from this and also keep a good relationship with my husband? I don't even know what my legal rights are if he were to say we're moving and I don't want to.\n",

      "I need a perspective on what happened between me (36F) and my bf (38M) to understand whether I am in an abusive relationship. We have been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went for a trip planned some time ago. My bf loves taking care of planning the itinerary and I give him the opportunity with pleasure. He takes pride in being known for being a skillful organizer. He took care of the first two days and said he will arrange the rest on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bf has a problem with being chronically late and sleeping in. This annoys people at work and his friends complain as well.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have my fair share of issues, which I work on relentlessly through various therapies, self-help, meditation and being vulnerable by talking to friends who see through my bullshit. I was adamant about doing couples therapy in the early stages of the relationship, which we did for 3 months. I would usually be the one bringing up issues, he is always cool as a cucumber. He is conflict avoidant and prides himself on a rational, strategic approach to relationships. Therapist seemed to like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning after arrival to the first hotel his alarm started ringing, and as usual he would snooze it multiple times and cuddle with me instead. Finally I said that maybe it's better that we wake up to not lose the day. He opened his eyes and was visibly unhappy, asking why I didn't wake him up earlier. I said that this is his responsibility to wake up, and actually eventually I did wake him up anyways, so I don't see the issue. He was unhappy but we moved on with the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today the alarm rang and he started snoozing again. After two snoozes I say \"I am waking up and will take a shower, you should wake up too\". He said \"ok babe\", but stayed in bed. I go out of the shower and say \"Babe wake up\". He still procrastinates. Eventually he opens his eyes and is pissed because he realises hotel breakfast will only be served for 5 minutes longer. He attacks me asking why didn't I wake him up? I get really angry and say that, again, it's not my responsibility and wtf is this blame-shifting? He still complains about the situation and decides to still try and grab the breakfast. I say I'd rather eat on my own in a cafe later because I feel hurt, which after he returns to the hotel room, I do. I ask him to please pick me up from the cafe on his way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "While im in the cafe he texts me a screenshot of a map with a hiking trail. I don't reply and proceed with eating, but in 30min I decide to ask where is he. He says \"can you stop complicating things? I sent you the location\". I said that sending a screenshot is not direct communication and if he wants me to show up somewhere, he needs to say so. He says he is tired of this bullshit. I say that I feel hurt by the way he communicates. He proceeds by calling me immature,  sending memes making fun of me being emotional, and eventually threatens that he will go to the hike on his own. He starts countdown (!) over text. I say that I can't continue on this trip without talking the situation through first. Eventually he says that he is going without me. I decide to take the train back home and inform him, stating that I hope he can resolve this issue with a therapist. I say that I love him and wish him a happy stay, but he never answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now I was finding this relationship great, although he did show a dismissive side in the past. This is a first time when something of this magnitutde happened and I am a bit scared that there is something wrong with him. We recently started trying for a child. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have dated for a year and a few months, and I visit him at his apartment a lot whenever I have multiple off days from work. A couple months ago I walked into his closet and saw what looked to be a small makeup bag sitting on the top shelf. Admittedly, I had skimmed through his closet before so I knew this bag was something that had not always been there and most likely was placed there recently. Inside of the bag was multiple sample skin care products , which didn’t freak me out because my boyfriend gis into skincare so it’s not too far off for him to own that. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, what I also found was lipgloss that DEFINITELY did not belong to me. I calmly confronted him over it once he got home that day and he said that the bag was given to him from a friend and was all samples. I offered to take the lipgloss if it was truly an unopened sample seeing has he wasn’t going to use it and he told me that it probably was used. When I asked by who he said “ a girl he used to know” definitely didn’t believe that, but for my own mental health I dropped it. He’s also been so incredibly sweet and seemingly obsessed with me that I told myself he couldn’t possibly be hiding something from me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today, he is at work and I am alone in his apartment again. I snooped through his closet again and this time found a necklace which (you can guess) isn’t mine. I feel sick and I don’t know what to do. I know it’s wrong to go through his stuff but seeing as I literally found some other girls makeup in his closet I can’t say I don’t have decent reason to be untrusting of him right now. I plan on bringing this up when he gets home but I don’t know how to go about it because I know he’s just going to lie to me. How does one approach someone about this?\n",

      "\n",
      "TL; DR - My (46F) BF (49M) has a decades-long friendship with a woman friend (47F) who has been unpleasant towards me and who isn't interested in getting to know me. They went out to dinner alone, and I didn't like what he reported back about how it went. We discussed how to handle it; I wasn't comfortable with the resolution until yesterday when we clarified some things. It turns out he had already taken many steps to distance himself from her and is fully committed to making sure all of his friends treat me respectfully.\n",

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I had a long chat with BF yesterday. I am feeling fine now. I had made some incorrect assumptions and misunderstood a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1 - He had already resolved to refuse any one-on-one invites from her. At the end of our last discussion, he'd said he wasn't sure what he would say to her. I thought that meant he wasn't sure if he would turn her down or not. He actually just meant he wasn't sure how he would phrase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 - I assumed they were in closer touch over text than is true. After the dinner last year, I told him that I'd prefer him not to go out with her alone but that I didn't expect him to completely end the friendship and that remaining in contact was fine as long as it was appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he had not initiated a single text to her since their dinner last year after I expressed concern. She has texted him maybe 5 times in the past year, all very benign and appropriate, like \"Happy birthday\" or \"I heard your uncle passed away; condolences.\" He responded to each with polite but very short messages \"Thank you. Hope you're well.\" No phone calls or other forms of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that they'd been slightly drifting apart before we met anyway, so he decided to steer things in the direction of drifting even further out of contact since it was creating an issue for us. He was prepared to be more confrontational if she got inappropriate again but was happy to find that it wasn't necessary. As mentioned in the original post, they have many many overlapping friend and family links so it would be preferable not to have a dramatic rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - I assumed they were bumping into each other at group events with some frequency. It turns out she hasn't been able to attend any of the same events that he has. The last time they actually saw each other was in fact that dinner last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that I was avoiding asking for details about how often they were in contact as a way to cope with my discomfort without being too controlling. I can be a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\" so I was doing well in not letting it bother me until I saw her name pop up in a recent text, right after one of those events that I'd assumed he'd seen her at. We decided that going forward, he will proactively tell me anytime he has even incidental contact with her so that I can assume nothing is happening if I don't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a long discussion about respect in general. He is totally willing to drop any friends who are disrespectful to me or our relationship. We also discussed what appropriate behaviors look like; I think he has a much better awareness now. I asked him to think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was out alone with a male friend, and he was a fly on the wall, would be happy to hear us discussing sex or hear the other guy make even borderline disparaging remarks about him? He admitted that he would not, and he will adhere to the same standard going forward with any female friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he said he's willing to refuse any other one-on-one invitations from women who don't want to include me and to drop the friendship if they are pushy about it. Luckily this isn't likely to be a big issue, as I have met and really like most of his female friends, and the ones who live far away and haven't visited yet have already said that they're eager to meet me as soon as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I currently feel a little silly for having worked myself up so much over a woman that he's seen once and exchanged about 20 words of text with in the past 18 months. But relieved that it's resolved. And I learned that the \"out of site out of mind\" tactic is not a good long-term fix for me; if something is bugging me, I need to go ahead and ask about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "My (29F) boyfriend (28M) often makes snide remarks about how my family supports me financially, and calls me privileged for it. We've been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an only child, my family isn't rich but we share what we have with each other. Before my current boyfriend, I was with an ex that painted himself as a good guy up until I moved across the country with him and he isolated me, abused me, stole all my money, and knocked me up. I have a 2 year old daughter with him, but I was able to escape the situation when I was 5 months pregnant. My parents bought my plane ticket home and welcomed me with open arms. They assumed full financial responsibility for my child and I so that I could be a stay at home mom on top of healing from the trauma and going back to college to finish up my degrees and work when I'm ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend comes from an affluent family; however, his father passed away 2 years ago, and he was the sole breadwinner for the family. It turned his family's life upside down, his mother is now living off of money lent from other family members and social security as she's in her 70s and can't work. He works under the table at a place that doesn't pay hourly, it's based on commissions. He's there for 10+ hours some days but if there's no customers, he doesn't get paid a penny. On a good day, he'll make about $70, but that's so disproportionate to what he should be making for that amount of time worked (we're in CA). He's really angry about not having much money, but also refuses to look for another job out of loyalty to his boss who's also his friend. He's always upset about being late on payments as well as his mom asking him for money. I feel bad for him and I try to be as understanding as I can, I know he's under a lot of stress financially, and I never ask him for anything or expect anything from him. Just his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he's been making more and more jabs at me about being \"Miss Privileged\" for taking handouts from my parents and not having to work while he works 5 days a week and is still struggling to make ends meet. All my parents help me with is my $25 a month phone bill and food and clothes from the thrift store for my daughter. I left everything I had when I left my ex and came home to my parents and live minimalistically, but my boyfriend had many payments he's responsible for (car, phone, credit card, student loans, helping his mom, etc). I'm trying to be empathetic towards him and I know he has it much harder than me, but there's nothing I can do about it and I don't think I should be ashamed for having a family that takes care of me when I'm down.\n",

      "Title: My bf 32M being rigid about technicality over my 38 F well-meaning gesture (and cultural differences)\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "My boyfriend accused me of “deceiving” his friends because I secretly paid for a meal in Korea last year, which is a common cultural gesture. He brought it up months later during dinner and wouldn’t let it go, even after I explained. Now we’re not talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warning: wall of text \n",
      "\n",
      "Last night, me (38 F) and my bf (32 M) of 1.5 years went out to dinner (korean bbq). For context, I am from South Korea and he from Europe. And we’re currently traveling in Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the lovely meal, he saw this woman from a different table telling her friends shed go to the bathroom but instead she went to the counter to pay for the meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Btw, this is a very korean thing and i did this too when my bf was in korea last year and his work friend came to korea with his wife to travel. I paid (it was only about $35) largely because we were all having a lovely time and also it is just korean hospitality. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the friends realized what i did they said they hoped to split the bill, and i explained to them that it’s korean custom to treat friends and guests like this and that usually the older one pays for the meal (and i was the oldest by a few years).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway that night ended very well with the friends thanking and saying theyd treat me when i come to their city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to last night, my bf was observing this woman and said, “Look, shes deceiving them like you did.” I felt quite bad at his phrasing but decided to let it slide and instead explained how common it is in Korea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still he was focused on confirming i was deceiving everyone when i said id go to the bathroom when that wasn’t what i was doing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, not wanting to ruin the night and also because we were close to the next table and i didn’t want to get embarrassed by fighting with him, i explained it is a gesture (almost a cliche) here. The thing is he is very fluent in korean and knows a lot about korea having lived here for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, as he kept insisting “you did deceive us. You know they were quite upset?” And i said “upset? I do remember them saying theyd like to split the bill but then i did explain the culture and we were all good at the end, and your friend even praised me the next day to you via text (talking about my kindness)”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently that didn’t matter. Because i was lying when i said id go to the bathroom . Now, i was starting to feel upset but i kept my cool and said “oh i see, you are not familiar with this. Let’s just say its a cultural difference between us. Look, i was just making a friendly gesture blah blah” but no, he wasn’t having any of that, ha. \n",
      "\n",
      "And regardless of whos in the wrong here, i was more like, why on earth would you bring that up (well, he says it was because that womans action reminded him of what i did) and revisit the moment to point out my wrongs from half a year ago? We were having a good time yesterday. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re still not talking as i can’t possibly wrap my head around this and i dont even want to see him or look him in the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Id really love some advice on how to best process this situation? Did I do something really wrong here?\n",

      "I’m dating someone who is amazing to me on all platforms. Everyone deserves to feel this type of undevoted love and commitment. But there’s something that I can’t get past— his drinking. And it sucks because he is not a mean drunk, abusive, nothing. He just drinks too much and too often. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have approached him about it before as I have childhood trauma from alcohol abuse and it’s also just something that is not attractive. We have that conversation twice. He got sober for about 2 weeks and then went back into drinking. I justified it as it’s not hard alcohol, but I told him he can’t just have one drink. He realized it and did better, but it just never stuck. Now, it’s the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned this and I haven’t been able to separate from him since he wasn’t in the states cause he went on a family vacation. \n",
      "\n",
      "His family told him a while back he drinks too much and they were concerned. He knew they were disappointed but nothing seemed to get through to him. Finally, we start dating and 2 months in was the first time I approached the drinking issue. And then the back n fourth of sobriety or cooling it on drinking. He lost 12 lbs from that only. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward- I met his family and his parents thanked me that I helped him cool down on the alcohol. How are they see the love he has and the work he is putting in. But his mom pulled me aside and something along the lines of “I know you love each other but please always remember yourself if it becomes too much”. And that hit. This was back in March. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went on my vacation for my bday 2 ish weeks ago, let’s just say… I was annoyed. On the second to last night, we all went in another country. I knew he was drinking by himself while doing a chores as I always clock when he has been drinking and not telling me. So that next day, he was SEVERELY hungover to where he was shaking, cold shivers, feeling nauseous, etc. at that point, I didn’t feel an ounce of emotion as I was already fed up. Decided I’ll talk to him once we get back to the states. Mind you, not admitting he drank heavily by himself all day. \n",

      "So I talked to him a week later…. Comes over intoxicated…. And passes out as we’re having an important conversation of me expressing my hurt….. \n",

      "\n",
      "Now today.. he’s on his way home from his family vacation and I know I have to have this hard conversation once again and remind myself I need to respect my boundaries and self work I have created since my childhood, which he is aware about. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just here to vent. To remind myself that I’m doing the right thing. To express I have so much love for him, he does anything and everything for me without a second guess.. I’m just hurt trying to compartmentalize it all. I feel like the bad guy for doing this for myself. I want him to better himself but this was an issue I’ve dealt with him 2 months in. He’s not a bad person, I do want a future with him, I just need to take a step away as the drinking issue is truly hurting me.  \n",

      "Title: Girlfriend (27F) didnt want kids with me due to autism risk - Now says its about fearing I (33M) wont share the parenting load. I ended things but she now wants us to stay together as she works through therapy and needs to see me address her concerns in order to be all in on kids together.\n",
      "Body text: My girlfriend (27F) and I (33M) have been together for 2.5 years and have lived together for 9 months. It’s been the best and healthiest relationship I’ve ever had—lots of love, shared values, emotional connection, and fun. But for over two months now, we’ve been stuck in a state of uncertainty that’s taken a toll on me emotionally. For me, having kids is a life long goal and deal breaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root issue has been her fears around having biological children with me. After learning about my nephew’s autism 2 years ago and telling me for a long time that she thinks I might also be on the spectrum (I’m not diagnosed and don’t believe I am), she became deeply anxious about the risk of having a child with autism. We met with a genetic counselor who gave an updated estimated risk between 10–25%. Prior to this genetic counselor meeting, she said indicated that this risk was outside her comfort zone, and she couldn’t say whether she still wanted to have kids with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 2 months, she has been saying she needs more time to think, to get further testing done, and to start therapy (which hadn’t happened until now—she just scheduled her first session). I tried to be supportive, but she stayed stuck in fear, never able to say she was “all in” on kids even when asked directly. At the same time, she would get defensive or angry when I asked for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I reached my limit and broke up with her. I’ve felt hopeless and emotionally drained for months and didn’t see signs that she was getting unstuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she’s asking to revisit the breakup. She moved up her first therapy session and says she’s had a breakthrough: that the real fear isn’t about genetics but about co-parenting. She says her childhood trauma makes her fearful of ending up in a parenting situation where she’s emotionally and mentally alone—especially if we were to raise a child with more complex needs. She said my lack of consistency in sharing household and emotional labor has triggered that fear. She also now says the genetic risk isn’t too high for her anymore, but that being able to handle it depends on how supported she feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first time she framed things this way. For the past two months, it was primarily about the autism risk and genetic testing. I don’t know whether to see this as a real emotional shift or a last-minute pivot because I finally ended things. Even during the breakup, she couldn’t say she was fully in on having kids with me—just that she needs more time and therapy to get clarity and also to see me step up in the mental load sharing and household chores.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Do I give her time and space to go to therapy, work through her fears, and see if this really is the shift we needed?\n",

I recently ended things, but she now wants to revisit the breakup, saying she’s had a personal breakthrough—that the real issue isn’t genetics but fear of not having a supportive partner. She’s just starting therapy and says she now believes the updated autism risk isn’t too high for her even though it seemed like it was previously. I don’t know if I should give her the time to grow or walk away for good\n",

      "Title: My husband (31M) and I (29F) always fight when I'm on vacation (due to chores).\n",
      "Body text: Hello! I'm not good at choosing titles and the situation is a bit more complicated, but here goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been with my husband for around 7 years, married 2. Initially we were both working, and both HARD workers. I usually came back home late from doing three thousand things (I lived alone so I also managed the rest of the survival stuff, of course) and my husband (who lived with his parents) did regular overtime for no reason but that he liked his job so much.  We both specialize in language work (let me know if you need more details).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of our marriage, my husband lost his job. It came out of nowhere as he was performing well, and it took a toll on him emotionally, but I reassured him that everything would be fine since he's actually good at what he does. We came up with this agreement: he'd pick up the majority of the housework while looking for a new job and I'd focus on work, with the exception of things that I prefer to manage myself because I'm more organized and less forgetful, i.e. keeping track of the bills, scheduling appointments and doing the laundry since my clothes need an amount of care I don't want to dump on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This didn't work out well from the start. My husband cooks, which is great, but aside from that he does the bare minimum not to be outright unsanitary. He washes the dishes, tosses the trash, uses the robot to vacuum the floor and puts his dirty clothes in the dedicated laundry area. But... that's it. He cleans surfaces (like the sink or the furniture) whenever I beg him to do it, like after a month or two, and constantly leaves stuff on tables etc around the house without putting it away. This creates mess and dust. Initially I kept asking him to do things, but I stopped recently because I thought that maybe I was micro-managing....... and this is an example of what happened: he left a bag with a piece of clothing he needed to take to the mender (10 minutes away on foot) on a chair for two months, up to the point that when I asked him if I should take it instead, he didn't even remember where he had put it (though it's literally in plain view in the living room).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had conversations with him about this, and he insists that he can't focus on anything else while he's stressed out looking for a job. I understand his feelings, so I told him to let me know if he wants to change the division of labor, since I'd rather know upfront that I need to do something (so I can schedule it in my day directly) rather than having the false reassurance that it'll get done just to find out that it's still there weeks or months later. To this, he tells me not to worry and to leave it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has all come to a head recently because my job has suddenly become more demanding. I was usually able to do some more things around the house whether he asked me for help or not, but for the past few months I've barely had any time to exist outside of work. My company's most important client has started multiple lengthy, specialized projects at the same time, with barely meetable deadlines even with a full team. What's worse: we're two people short. My company doesn't want to say no to the client, and I don't want to say no to the company since my job is otherwise great (plus better paid than 90% of jobs in my industry) AND the only money that keeps me and my husband afloat, so I've been literally working for three people nonstop. I regularly go to sleep with a headache, wake up with a headache, and feel back pain. My fingers have started twitching like a pre-industrial revolution factory worker. I've still been managing admin tasks at home, but I honestly haven't had the physical or emotional strength to un-mess the tables and whatnot. I don't even have it in me to talk to friends most days anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time, whenever it's been the weekend or a bank holiday, we've fought. I start it: I wake up without being too busy to care what's going on, so I look around and I still see items and bags that were there weeks before. So I get upset and I ask him why he can't fulfill his end of the bargain as I do. Yesterday he told me, in more or less these words: \"If I did what you do, I'd be able to do more and faster. You just have to sit and type. It's not the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it may seem absurd, but I could divorce over this. I've been feeling so aggressively angry all of last night, but while typing this, I realize that if it were anyone else I'd just calmly tell them to leave. Yes, if I turn my brain off and forget adulting, I still love my husband: he knows a lot, he's interesting to talk to, he's VERY beautiful and I enjoy spending time together. But as soon as I look around at our life, I feel like an ATM. This isn't the first time that he has implied that my job is easier, and I'm tired of hearing it when I KNOW that I'm breaking my back much harder than a dude dusting shelves for an hour every month. He claims that he didn't mean it as a comparison, that he just wanted to say that my job is easier in a vacuum, but even then...... What does it even mean? And why should it be relevant to him NOT doing the stuff we agreed he would, anyway?\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize if this turned midway into a rant. I guess what I want to know is... Does this sound like we're both being unreasonable? Is it a miscommunication issue? Would a couples counsellor help? Should I find another job at the expense of being poorer and even worse off? I don't know what to say anymore, I just feel tired and I want things to work without constantly fighting over something.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Me (29F) and my unemployed husband (31M) always fight due to the division of chores. We agreed on something, but it isn't working out, and I feel led on and used while my husband claims he's just too overwhelmed by his own situation. Meanwhile, I'm resentful as I'm forfeiting my own life and health to keep a well paid job.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: Thank you all for your input! There was a lot to unpack, and I can't reply to every comment because of time constraints or because I genuinely don't have anything smart/useful to add without doing some introspection. However, I appreciate all advice given.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR my husband of 11 years says he has no emotional connection to me anymore, that he can’t tell me anything or talk to me and I’m looking for advice to help repair this. We have a 7 month old baby and I currently do 95% of the work with the baby. \n",
      "\n",
      "The long post:\n",
      "I was recently told by my husband that he has absolutely no emotional connection to me anymore. I will note that I have BPD but have gotten it under control for the most part. I am 7 months postpartum now and feel better about myself than ever after finding a newfound love and happiness in motherhood that I didn’t expect to find. In our relationship in the past, my feelings were always bigger and stronger and took up more space and I take responsibility for the implications of that. It caused him to bottle things up and he grew anxious telling me anything and that put distance there. This was 11 years in the making and we have been married for 3 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a father, he’s been less than ideal, acting like he can go do whatever he wants whenever he wants and only makes cameos throughout the day when I work a full time job and care for our 7 month old. He told me this week that he can’t stop thinking about how much better his life would be if he didn’t get married and have a kid. He’s in a dark place for sure but I didn’t expect it to be this dark. He just wants to go do what he wants, when he wants and he doesn’t want me to judge him for anything. I judge him because he’s a father and husband and signed up for this a bit and he doesn’t want the responsibility of it. He can’t stand that he needs to fix something in the house or take the garbage out. He’d rather just not live by any rules of life. Fly by the seat of his pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought up how he has no emotional connection to me anymore. He doesn’t know what to do with it. Because he doesn’t want to lose seeing our baby every day either. He said I don’t ask how he is (I have plenty but he never shares or says fine) and I am not emotionally supportive. I’m wondering how else I can be emotionally supportive for him since I care about him deeply and don’t want this marriage to end. I’m wondering what the male emotional support looks like or what other ways I can be there for someone who really is just completely shut down and bitter over the last 11 years. I also dont want to hear to throw in the towel because I love this man, I just have a complicated past and it has tainted our relationship in a lot of ways but I want to repair. But I also want to share the mental load with someone since I currently do it ALL with the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just looking for some advice, someone to talk to, maybe someone who went through this and got out the other side. I’m losing it and I’m so anxious and I just need some perspective here. I want this to work out.\n",

      "Body text: Growing up, I (24F) thought my parents had a solid relationship. But at 20, my mom told me she was blindsided into marrying my dad, who stopped her from pursuing a job abroad. Over the years, I realized how emotionally manipulative and neglectful he has been. He never bonded with me or my brother (26M), never supported us emotionally, and left all the financial and parental responsibilities to my mom. She worked abroad and even had to come home when my brother went through depression. Meanwhile, my dad did nothing but spend her hard-earned money on his hobbies.\n",

      "After his accident last year, he stopped trying to find work. My mom, already working full time as a nurse, had to handle all his medical needs and bills.

      "Title: My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage\n",
      "Body text: I (22 F) and my fiancé (24 M) just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that. Since the very beginning of our relationship, it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother (62 F). Now, it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my now fiancé and I began dating, I began to tell my mom about him, since I was obviously excited about this new relationship. Some of her biggest gripes were that he’s nothing more (in her mind) than a backwoods redneck, and essentially that I’m too good for him. But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long-time Jehovah’s Witnesses. Ever since I told her this, she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had. \n",
      "\n",
      "Example A: She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up. I told her no, it really wasn’t his thing, and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork/construction that he does now, and never took much of an interest in sports. She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn’t done any sports, since he couldn’t do anything that would put him around being people that weren’t JW (I know this is true within the religion, but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young). I’ve tried to explain this as not true, but she simply won’t accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example B: I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in. After dating for almost a year, I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living. Ever since I’ve moved, and especially after I told her about our engagement, all she does is say that I’ve been “sucked in”. She’s convinced I’m in a cult. She’s also said she hates my ex boyfriend (who cheated on me) to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example C: Since starting working post-college, I’ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into (fundraising), and I haven’t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before. I’ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life, like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home, since I have learned that cleaning, cooking, and decorating, are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall. She says I’m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I’m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years. She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from, even after I had said many times I didn’t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new, and find a nice boy down there to settle down with.\n",

      "Example D: Since announcing our engagement, she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare. When I told her our initial wedding date, she asked why we were rushing it. I told her we just didn’t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married. She grilled me and said I must be pregnant, and what happened to having a long engagement? \n",
      "\n",
      "She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family, even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family. From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating, she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer (we live 4.5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends) and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up, she told me it was already too late (this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating)\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family. When we weren’t speaking a couple months back, she didn’t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because “I didn’t ask how the dog was”. I never got a chance to say goodbye. Before this she had previously called me at 12:30 am after we hadn’t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent $10,000 at the casino. Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should’ve never asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family. This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself/our relationship as he calls it. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I told my mother the date, she said it was too soon and that she didn’t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn’t help me with the wedding. I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would, and she said yes. I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors. While this was true, after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well. My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where, for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding, and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since, we’ve been arguing pretty consistently. The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement. He’s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing, and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I’m in. But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I’m going to be loyal to him, not to my mom. The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some, and he’s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to, since it is a small town here. My in laws are absolutely incredible, and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom. We often go out to lunch together, and just spend a lot of time together overall. Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard. I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing. My mom is my only family, since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn’t close with any of her siblings, and all my grandparents are gone. I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else. How do I prove myself to my fiancé? How do I stick up to my mother, and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her? Can I salvage a relationship with both of them? My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me, like being the parent that stayed when my dad left. But I also love my fiancé more than anything, and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us. He’s said he’s just been in a down mood in general, he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement, because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness. I’ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it’s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings. Thank you in advance for any advice\n",

      "TLDR: My mom has disrespected my fiancé and our relationship from the start, and her constant interference has led him to postpone our wedding. He wants me to prove I can stand up to her and put our relationship first. I’m torn between my only family and the person I want to spend my life with.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "My (29f) boyfriend (32m) and I have been together for 4 years. We have had issues with him cheating and it’s recently gotten worse but he never takes accountability or admits to his wrongdoing because of a situation that happened before we were together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before we got together, I hooked up with a girl that I was friends with at the time and and didn’t tell him. He went through my phone and found out and was livid and said I was a liar because he inferred based on our texts that I hooked up with her boyfriend at the time as well (as a threesome). I didn’t. He has always been convinced that I did and will literally throw it in my face whenever I call him out on anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I found out that he invited a girl to our apartment when I was out of town, took my car to see another girl while his was getting fixed and it was on the SAME DAY he took me to get my birthday present, he drove two hours away to meet up with a girl he’s been talking to for over a year, lied to me about working an extra overnight shift at work and went to some girls house and spent the night. This was all within the last month. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been dating since January 2025. It’s been smooth sailing and we really care about each other — except for one issue: his girl best friend, we’ll call her Emma. They text constantly and he’s always confided in her about our relationship, since we started seeing each other. In my past relationships, female friendships have never been an issue. But this is different- she texts him like he’s her boyfriend (ex: “ok, boarding my flight right now! Ok just landed safely!”) What makes it worse? They have a history - they’ve kissed, and admitted feelings for each other last year. At the time, they didn’t date, because my boyfriend was hooking up with Emma’s friend and they didn’t want to hurt her. Well, it did - Emma’s friend found out and has since cut her off.\n",

He said he can work on boundaries with her, but he’s not super convincing and I still feel uneasy.

      "Body text: My husband was diagnosed with depression few years ago and takes depression medication. He gets angry easily and lashes out on me when he is stressed. We currently have a newborn baby (1 month old). My husband is willing and shares responsibility with the baby. However when anything goes wrong or out of plan with the baby or when he gets too stressed he takes it out on me. He blames me and my mother who is also here helping with the baby. It is causing me so much stress in addition to taking care of the baby. He is usually very rigid in his beliefs and makes the baby cry while he takes care of him. He patches up with me after a day or so and apologises. However the constant stress of having to deal with his tantrums and blaming is taking a serious toll on me at this already stressful time.His medication seems to be making him angry when he does not get enough sleep. All this conflict is making me very emotional and depressed myself. Despite taking care of the baby for most of the day, he keeps blaming me for any inconvenience he faces with the baby. This repeats every few days. I am not able to understand how I can cope with his behaviour. I’ve contemplated divorce before however he keeps letting me know how much he loves me and takes good care of me when he is not in his stressed. I am so lost and looking for some direction in how I can handle this situation and relationship\n",

His friends were very nice, but after I said a comment to him, he told me “shut the fuck up” and “don’t look at me like that” to which I was shocked by. They were both said in a joking tone, not mean. He has said something like that to me one other time a few months ago and i immediately told him to never speak to me like that. He apologized and hasn’t since then. I think it was him being drunk and with his friends and wanting to impress them or whatever.

      "Body text: Update 1  \n",
      "Last night I tried searching for her favorite blue dress in her size but couldn't find it. I'm not sure they make it anymore. I called my sister as she is a seamstress and asked her to modify my wife's favorite dress. When my wife fell asleep I took the dress and one of her newer dresses to her to see what she could do. When I learn how to put a picture here I will. She added more holes, buttons and this asian belt thing I see the japanese women with the white face make up wear. My sister put it in a nice box for me with pink ribbon on top because my wife loves the color pink.  I brought it home and woke my wife up for a surprise. At first I know the dress put her off. When she tried it, I could hear for just a second a squeak. Her high-pitched squeak when she's happy. She came out twirling and asked where I bought it. When I told her it was her old dress, she ran to the drawer and found it missing. She looked anxious and nervous, not sad. Like she didn't know what to do. I told her how much I love her and how I noticed she doesn't seem to be happy. That there's nothing I won't do to see her happy again. That if she needs ANYTHING to TRULY feel herself,  happy, warm and fuzzy that there is nothing I won't do. We can tailor all her old clothes if she wants to, get a brand new wardrobe if she would like. There are even handheld sewing machines on amazon. Her response was to hug me as tight as she could and asked if we could possibly do a little of both. Her voice was soft like it gets when she's embarrassed and uncomfortable. I felt myself break inside. I love this woman with my whole  being and she feels embarrassed about asking for things, from me, her husband. She's a do it all woman. I just held her as tight as I could without hurting her and had to make her look at me so she could see and understand \"yes, I just want to see you happy again.\" We just held each other for awhile. She looked so tired but that little happy smile is coming back. She played with the bow on her belt. \n",

She recently dropped over 100 lbs in a very short time due to illness. She hates it. All her attempts to dress up or down send her into a quiet spiral she won't tell me about but I see it. I see it when she isn't smiling even when she's concentrating. Her smile is practically glued in place. When she isn't smiling I know something isn't going ok. I caught her pulling on her cheeks, glanced and saw her push her tongue to her cheek to push them out. Lifting and pulling on her cheeks when her skin is firm, tight and there's no sag for her to pull. It looks like a parent pinching their child's cheek but hard. A few times I try to make a little noise in another room, so she doesn't know I saw her. I don't want to make her feel bad. I just don't want my wife to be unhappy anymore. She's never wanted or considered surgery. She supports those who do, but she isn't healthy enough currently for a lot of things, including major surgeries.\n",

I just want her to feel comfortable and happy, I tell her everyday how beautiful she is. No photo i've ever held of her was ever \"not beautiful\" to me. I know she believes me, but am I sending her mixed signals? What can i do? I just want her to be happy again. I want her to smile again and feel comfortable again.\n",

      "For context we had a rough patch at the start of our marriage because I was so insecure about his exes because he told me about them too much when we were dating, he told me they broke up because it was a mutual understanding because they did not love each other anymore, so I was paranoid because we had dated only a short while after they broke up and got married 6 months after fast-forward to now he confessed that he had lied to me about the reason why, it turns out he cheated on both his exes and his recent one with the one prior and then cheated on the recent one with someone he met on a business trip. I asked him why he didn't tell me he said it was because he knew I loathed cheaters and I wouldn't marry him if I knew he was one (My dad cheated on my mom, which my mom still doesn't know about and I don't have the heart to tell her). \n",

I don't really know whether to believe that that was it, but now I'm stuck because he took off to his friends house because he said he couldn't face me. I don't know what to do moving forward, I want to try to mend things but I don't know how we can manage if he keeps running away from me and I just end up feeling like I'm chasing after a dead end. I guess I'm insecure of being divorced because it's frowned upon where I grew up. Sorry this is long I guess I just need to vent because he won't come home and doesn't want to talk to me.

      "I \\[28M\\] have been dating my girlfriend \\[23F\\] for 4 years now. She is amazing, beautiful and probably one of the only people who has given me an ear and supported me throughout some of my toughest days, particularly as my mental health is not the best at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when going into the relationship, I did mention to her that my parents would be an obstacle.

Since young, myself and my siblings know that my parents want us to be with someone from our culture and ethnicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier on in the relationship, I did have a chat with my mum saying that I am with an English girl and I would like her support/blessing but she would not give it to me... I asked if she could at least meet her and she said she did not want to.\n",

      "Fast forward to today, I am ready to move to the next level with my girlfriend, and my hope was that time would make my parents more receptive towards it. Yesterday evening, I had a chat with my mum and she said the same, saying I am too young and to wait until the right person from our culture comes along. I explained to her the amount of time we had spent together, the trips we had taken and all I am looking for is just support from them.\n",

I can't help who I have fallen in love with but at the same time, family is very important in my culture and I feel trapped in the sense that I want to go to the next level but my family would not permit that. If I wanted to get married to this girl, they would not want anything to do with it. I despise it and find it archaic. I am not sure if it matters but I am still living at home also so if people do suggest for me to go against it then I cannot really escape them at this point of time. I am saving for a house deposit but that could still take a while. I guess this is my fault and I am trapped in the middle.\n",

This moment, and the appreciation my colleagues had, led me to reflect on some of my life's achievements (both personal and work) and I felt a strong sense of appreciation for the privilege I've been fortunate enough to come across, the people in my life, and of course, what I've put in to make it all come together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I reflected on this with my wife in the evening, where I told her this story, told her that it's moments like this that make me reflect on our successes (i.e. mine, hers, and our joint successes), and that I'm grateful that I've had the good fortune of having achieved all of these great things by age 30, many of which were achieved alongside her (e.g. university degree, my leadership position at work, owning our own house, having a family...etc. amongst other things). I also pointed out some of the great achievements that she's personally had as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her first reaction was to say \"I think in some sense you fell into this path, it's not your plan or choice from the beginning\", which I strongly disagreed with, because it is certainly my choice to pursue things that have led to where we are today. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I expressed this, she said \"I think (insert friends' names) all achieved these things\", and when I pushed her on the specifics (as I felt she was just trying to undermine my point, which was to reflect on our successes, not to compare tit-for-tat with others) she just started to handball them away. For example, when I would point out specific things that we've achieved, she would say \"oh, I didn't count that\", or \"to me, that's similar to XYZ\", or \"not many people choose to do that\". \n",
      "\n",
      "We then looked up some statistics, after which she agreed that some of those achievements were worthy. At this point, I just felt that the conversation had completely derailed, as I'm not trying to \"size up\" ourselves, and I thought the broader point of appreciating our successes had been lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed this to her - that to me, she is always special, always the best, that when she achieves something, I always celebrate it, encourage it, help push her to achieve more, that I always tell her that she can do great things, that she deserves success. Whereas she always downplays my own success, and tells me it's either nothing special, or other people can also do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "She denied that she did this, and said that she cannot offer what I want, and that she cannot (quote) \"adore you\", to which my response was what I wanted was not adoration, but to have someone in my corner, just like I would for her. I gave her the example of always standing by and supporting your sports team, not blindly, but always being excited for every success. I told her that this is what I've always done for her, for my friends, and for my family - be in their corner, always. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told her that if she doesn't feel that the person she married is \"the best\" and to always support and celebrate them unconditionally, then she is condemning her partner (i.e. me) to a life of always needing to prove that they are worthy of her love (which is how I honestly always feel). \n",
      "\n",
      "Her response was \"it's not in my nature to say you are the best, but I do believe you can achieve whatever you want\", which I felt didn't really address my concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told her that she is the only person who never seems to appreciate the things I do, the successes I want to share, the projects I want to embark on...etc., and that even my parents and my friends show so much appreciation for smaller things. Her response was \"I consider you as a friend, a partner but also a competitor, and I think what you can do I also can\". She asked me what I wanted from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just really lost it at this point, and said the way she's treating me is emotional abuse (which I agree is harsh), because all I want is to be supported, to be appreciated, and to be valued, and that it was completely inappropriate for her to make comparisons between me and other people in the first place. I also said that I have never, ever pointed at someone and told her that what she does or what she has achieved is the same as them and not special, because it's just really insulting to do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "She ended up telling me she's \"sorry that hurts\" (not even sorry for her actions), and that \"I think I'm jealous with you and feel insecure. That's why I downplayed your achievement\", which I understand, but I've always celebrated her achievements, and even in our conversation today, brought up so many of the great things she's done. I just told her that I don't think she's capable of understanding my point of view, so best to just leave it for today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just at my wit's end because this has been happening for years, and I honestly just feel like every moment is me trying to earn some little bit of appreciation or acknowledgement from her. I really, honestly try my very best, and it's not like I expect her to say any grandiose things, just that I'm a good partner, that I make her happy, that she appreciates me, that XYZ is a \"great achievement\". That's all. I'm honestly just tired of having to feel like I need to \"earn\" her appreciation all the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the years, and years this has been going on for, I really feel like I've had enough and I'm just tired of not having someone to be able to share the exciting moments with without it becoming a buzz-kill. This will just come up every few weeks / months. I feel that her behaviour is toxic. I don't know if I should draw a line under this relationship and move on. I don't know what I could say to her to help her understand. \n",

By too long I mean I get worried after 12-16 hours. But every week or so he just disappears for more than 20-24 hours and then says sorry when I bring it up and say he was busy. I made it clear many times that I don't want us to talk for hours everytime we call but just a quick 30 second call or a one lined text are fine. He disappeared again around a week ago and completely ignored the fact that I called him and texted him many times. After that he said sorry and I said that was the last time I was forgiving him for this. The day before yesterday he disappeared again and when I called in the evening at around 19:30 he said his phone was off untill 11:00 and after that he thought I had classes. When he said that I just couldn't hold back my tears and cried for hours. I didn't know how I felt so hurt but I just couldn't stop crying. He sent me a few texts saying sorry and he is calling more often to check on me since then but I just don't want to reciprocate. I don't know how I feel and I just feel broken.

Shortly after this I dropped her off at her house and went home. The next day I asked her if she remembered what happened last night and she said she can’t remember anything (Bear in mind when I picked her up she was almost completely sober and said multiple times how she feels like she sobered up already) is she lying to me and acting like it never happened or being genuine. I’m not sure if I should bring it up or just forget it. I feel so guilty I wished I never kissed her even if she did reciprocate. Do I speak about it with her or leave it alone?\n",

      "Body text: The title is pretty self explanatory but I will provide some more details. I don't know where to start but I guess I can begin by asking my questions. 1) What can I do to feel like my husband actually hears my point of view and understands it? 2) Is the problem with me and I need to either ask for help better or change my expectations? 3) How do we change this dynamic so it works better in the future?\n",
      "\n",
      "Husband (45M) and I (38F) had a discussion (not a fight because it was respectful so more like a disagreement) last night while I was cooking dinner, which started with a comment about when he asked when the last time our (his) dog had a bath. Our dog has chronic skin issues and take multiple daily medicines, medicated baths 3x a week, and a monthly steroid shot to keep everything at bay. I responded with well what do you give your own dog a bath instead of nagging me. This led into a conversation about our division of labor which admittedly is pretty even...he drops of kids in the morning, i pick them up in the afternoon, he cooks dinner, i do the dishes, while he cooks I give kids a bath. You get the idea. The only unevenness comes from the other choices inside and outside the house. The inside of the house I mostly take care of (laundry, bathrooms, general organization and pick up) while he maintains the outside farm animals and make repairs and I take care of the garden. I think he has helped me fold laundry once (unasked) in 15 years. If I ask he will stop and help....but I have to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "So back to the discussion. I told him that if I cant manage to fold the towels (a clean pile has been sitting on the dinning room table) in the last two weeks (added work responsibilities) then when have I had the time to give a dog a bath. He said I just need to ask him to do it. I said if he known it needs to be done then just do it himself, he is capable and has eyeballs and can see what needs to be done. That when he verbalizes the to-do list of what we need to do (which 99.9%) of the time I do on my own, it just feels like nagging and a constant reminder of what I haven't finished yet. That reminders aren't helpful, but what would be helpful would be to just do the task. He then went into a rant about how he isn't a mind reader and he has his other responsibilities and that if he helps me fold the towels then I will just find something else to do instead of relaxing and sitting on the couch with him and the kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like whenever we have these discussions it becomes a circular argument, I don't feel heard, he thinks that I feel like he doesn't contribute and nothing gets resolved. Then our schedules calm down and I get caught up and everything is okay again until I get overwhelmed again. I don't know... when I see him struggling, I will stop what I am doing to help him (unasked) if I can manage it. Which also puts me behind in my task or I give up all my free time. But it feels like it doesn't happen in reverse or it does IF I only ask. And I leave the discussions feeling like it was all me and I need to make adjustments but I never hear from him, your right I can do this or that. So reddit can you answer my 3 questions or give me advice or perspective in how to break this cycle. We need a new dynamics so our house can run more efficiently and both don't feel like we are burning the candle at both ends.\n",

      "Body text: Hi all. So my boyfriend (21m) and I (20f) have flown to a different city this weekend for him to meet my parents for the first time. We’ve been dating for almost a year and are pretty serious- planning to move in together in the fall and talking about other bigger long term plans. \n",
      "\n",
      "My relationship with my parents has always been a bit rocky, the reasons as to why are a lot to get into, but it’s almost like my parents just had kids to fulfil the societal pressures. I think my mom also had a rough childhood and is just starting to go to therapy for it, but aspects of that definitely affected our relationship growing up. The biggest thing tho is that teasing is really common in my family, often to the point where the person being teased gets upset. Especially me in the past as I can be pretty sensitive. My house was also not the one where I could bring friends over at will just to chill- it was an ask ahead, double check, get permission before people come over kind of deal. So bringing my boyfriend to meet my parents was no small thing, not just to me but to my parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was prepared for things to go well- things went great when I met his parents- or maybe for my parents to not be super warm to him at first. When they first met, everything seemed great on the outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when we were alone, he said “I don’t like how your parents talk to you, it’s more than teasing, it’s bullying, they just seem like bad people” etc etc. I cant quite say the right thing on the offence, because I know my parents are a bit hard to get along with, but for me that’s how it’s always been. And it’s been so long since I had someone over to meet them that I really have no clue how to handle this. My mom asked me today if she was doing a good job and I had no clue how to give better feedback. My boyfriend said pretty much the same thing he said yesterday, today. “I dont like how they talk to you at all and that overshadows everything else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He says he’ll just deal with it, and he’ll never say anything bad or go against them to their face. But I want to spend a lifetime with him! And I don’t want to imagine every visit with my family and him together ending with me crying and him saying “I dislike the people who raised you.” But at the same time my parents are like that. \n",

      "\n",
      "Update: thank you everyone for the advice. After my boyfriend and I got ready for bed I told him “hey, you’re right, you don’t have to like my parents, especially since you’re disliking them because you feel like they don’t respect me. But I have to deal with it myself in my own ways.” He said he appreciated hearing that, and it made him feel really relieved. My favourite thing he said though was “I appreciated hearing that, but I didn’t need to hear it. I will support you and stick up for you regardless” which really shows the guy he is. I love him a lot, and of course there’s a reason I live a 14 hour drive away from my parents, so I shouldn’t be totally surprised. I also booked myself a therapy appointment for next Wednesday as per some of the advice here, so that will help too. Overall, thank you everyone for talking me down and respectfully getting me to realize I was in the wrong. \n",

      "I had no problem paying for gas or cigarettes when he needed, it wasn’t everyday and i had a chunk of change saved up from working (I took a break from working to go back to therapy and figure out what career i wanted to do). But after this had happened for a couple months I started to get curious because he hadn’t bought any truck parts for a few weeks but he was still running out of money really quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been through some crappy past relationships and have made a bad habit out of checking phones, so I had decided to go through his phone after not doing so for about 6 months or better. I found he had been sending $50 basically every other day to a friend of his who lives about 5 minutes away from us and i thought it was really strange because he wasn’t doing any work for us and he wasn’t coming home with anything like clothes or tools or such. Well about a week later I had gone through his phone again and found that he had been sending more money and even $100 at a time to this friend. My boyfriend had a past of doing pills and drinking before we got together so my first thought was “maybe he’s back on pills again”. What I didn’t know was that it would turn out to be worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "My curiosity got the better of me one day so when he had gone to work, I went out to his shop that’s behind our house and started looking around for anything that would clue me in on what was going on. What I didn’t intend to find was little straws with white powder in them, a little bowl with this shiny powder in it, and a meth pipe weirdly attached to part of a bong. I couldn’t even begin to grasp that he could be smoking meth, but i had nothing but proof in front of me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I waited until he got home to confront him and at first he denied denied denied. And made up lies saying it was his cousins stuff and that he would never do that or just completely ignoring any question I asked. Well after 10 minutes of complete silence from me he broke down and just started sobbing saying he’s been using meth since before we got together (over 2 years) and that he’s tried to quit but he just can’t. I couldn’t believe that he could hide that for so long behind my back. Almost right under my nose. But finding all this out, it explained so many behaviors he had. Being up all night some nights just working on “projects” that never got finished, going through all of his own stuff just to see what he’s got, feeling all of a sudden sick but blaming it on allergies or the pressure in the air changing. But it all makes sense. Withdrawals, drug usage, constantly thinking any noise outside means someone is outside messing with our stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had a few conversations about it, and he knows I want him to quit, but he doesn’t want to talk about it any. He just wants to sweep it under the rug and I can’t. I feel hurt and betrayed. How can you say you love me but hide this from me since the very beginning. I just want advice on how to handle this all. How do we get through this? How do i help him? At what point should I/do i walk away? How do we begin to rebuild the trust that was broken?\n",

      "TL;DR, I found out my boyfriend has been smoking and snorting meth throughout our entire relationship, and I don’t know how to get through this or if it’s a deal breaker\n",

      "Body text: My (29M) girlfriend (27F) and I have been together for over six years. I love her deeply, and I know she loves me as well - so much so that we fully intended to get married and start a family. I can't say it has always been the smoothest - we've struggled at times with her cleanliness, trust, her ability to follow through with promises/tasks, and her finances in particular. She misjudged how much she could pay for rent when we moved in together four years ago while she was still in school and, combined with a car that I paid for, wound up owing me around $24K. She always told me she intended to pay it back and I fully believe that is true. Recently, she has been lightly pushing for me to get a condo for us. She never pressured, but went out and found places that might be nice and in our budget and she claimed it would be good for our relationship - we would have more space to be less cluttered and could find a place we could grow into with children. I finally found one I liked, that was in budget assuming she could contribute a portion of the mortgage every month, and got it. The deposit is in and we're in escrow. I've had real anxiety the last few weeks about finances - my ability to pay for the condo, her ability to pay the piece of the mortgage, and the fact that almost all my money is going into the down payment. I expressed this to her, and she basically said that her finances are fine and she would be able to pay the mortgage. Yesterday, I learned that wasn't totally true. She has had a spending addiction since the top of the year (she blames it on depression), using over $20K that her aunt gave her to buy all sorts of things, without telling me about any of it. During this time, I had to loan her money occasionally (she always paid it back) for various things when she said her accounts were low. I'm gutted. She took money we could have used to stabilize our lives or to pay me back and threw it away. She's begging me for another chance, to go to therapy and to fix this, but I feel so betrayed - I told her my biggest worry was having our finances in order with this new place and she was spending tens of thousands of dollars behind my back. I still love her and I know she didn't mean to hurt me like this, but I just don't know if this relationship is worth saving at this point. \n",

For example apparently when I put my forks handle up in the dishrack, that was incorrect since the part you eat with touches the bottom, or for example after washing a dish I shouldn’t let it touch the sink again because that was dirty.

I tried to learn all of these rules but ultimately just got so many lectures that I avoid the living room altogether and mostly stay in my room now (we have a 2 bed apartment).

But I’m worried that since we haven’t been able to make home life work, and since we’ve been more distant than ever, this would be a mistake. I’m also worried about her timelines which she’s expressed concern about, and delaying them. I’m also worried talking to her about this wouldn’t be productive… she’ll definitely blame me. I am not sure if it would trouble her to get divorced or live separately after having a child. I’m very worried about this outcome because I’m confident I would be pushed out of my child’s life… like I was out of the living room. I think the cause of this is just that she has a greater capacity for confrontation… she can argue for hours, but I’m exhausted after 30 min of going in circles… she seems entirely unfazed by my complaints.\n",

      "Body text: I (29f) am unsure if I should end things with my (38m) fiancé.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some background, we’ve been together 7 years, and have know each other for 8. We got engaged last April. Our relationship has had been pretty rough from the start with a lot of trust issues sparking from him talking to women to try to have a threesome. I was originally ok with this as we agreed that I would be involved in the conversations so I knew what was happening. That obviously didn’t pan out and he ended up admitting to talking to someone for 6 months behind my back because he didn’t think I would agree to sleep with her. He was right and to put it into context the girl was 18 at the time he was 33. He said they talked only over instagram, from his fake account which I didn’t know existed at the time, and she didn’t know him and they never met up. He also was messaging girls he’s dated previously from his personal instagram behind my back to flirt, not ask for the threesome. Anyways after he admitted this 6 month thing with the 18 year old we agreed to stop trying for a threesome because he taking advantage of the situation. I also want to mention through this time it wasn’t good communication. There was a lot of yelling and him gaslighting me and it took a long time for him to admit anything. He also had a habit of being physical with the space around him in his anger (anger because I was finding things out) and he often times called me crazy and insecure for asking him about these things or to see his phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then hes deleted his fake account but has disrespected me in many other ways whether it was still messaging people he’s been on dates with before (not flirting per say but why is he talking to them still) or has been interested in before. I also found out he had thousands of screenshots of women on his phone ranging from pornographic photos to screenshots of people he knows even if it was just selfies. A lot of these screenshots however were, as I call them, Florida looking girls in their late teens/early 20s that he didn’t know. I’ve talked to him about this and he’s said he’s stopped the behaviour which I can confirm because I’ve seen his photos after this. He did also admit to having a porn addiction and most of the screenshotting was impulsive. He’s been working on that since and I do think it’s gotten better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally jump to this past year we got engaged on a trip and things were really good but there was a huge drop off in our dynamic, I would say over the last 7 months. We started going to therapy because of it and I became very unsure about his ability to be a good partner and eventually father.  Previous feelings of hurt surfaced with respects to all that’s happened in our past because it wasn’t dealt with in a healthy way, again also a reason we started therapy. I kept thinking to myself how can I marry someone who has done these things to me. We decided to postpone the wedding 2 days ago and I found out that he went and message a 22 year old “family friend” asking when she’d be back from school 3 hours after we emailed our venue to postpone. I say family friend loosely because his parent and her parents are friends but he’s only spoken to her 2 occasion in a group setting with the parents there and they weren’t even talking to each other directly (I was there when this happened). He said he reached out to her because his family was going to see her a lot this summer since they’re family friends and because she followed him on instagram. Mind you she’s almost never there when the family’s get together, in the 8 years I’ve known him she’s been there 2 times. I said that a follow isn’t an invitation to talk to her and also she looks exactly like the Florida girls he was screenshotting before so I’m sure there’s more of a sexual interest there. She is really really pretty and he has said he agrees she’s attractive. Either way a 38 year old trying to be friends with a 22year old is weird especially when you’re engaged. He also said he didn’t follow her back because he thought I wouldn’t approve… so he decided to message her behind my back instead. I found out because I noticed he removed some photos of us on his instagram and I asked him why he did that. He didn’t have a reason and so I asked to see his phone. He gave it to me after deleting something which I saw and I had to literally begging him to tell me who he was talking before admitting it. He also said he didn’t want to tell he because I would leave him if I knew… so why do it? He clearly knew it was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the guy and I want to be with him but I feel like he’ll never change. He feels awful for this but I wonder if it’s just cause he was caught and I wonder where their conversation would have gone if I didn’t find out… I’m so hurt, we’re engaged and actively working on mending our relationship and going to therapy and he does this. I’m currently taking a break from him, we’re not talking and I’ve moved in with my dad for space but I don’t know what to do.\n",

      "Body text: My bf (M 25) of 10yrs wanted me to try living with his family. I (F 24) am really hesitant because I grew up independently and I don’t want to be a burden somehow.

      "I have been with my boyfriend for 2+ years. We do not live together because our children from our previous marriages are still at home. We may move in together in a few years after they all leave for college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having met later in life, of course we both come into the relationship with lots of pre-existing friendships. Many of them have melded seamlessly, but there are some obstacles, especially with relationships on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my case, most of my friends were really my friends and not “friends of the marriage” - so he’s pretty much fully integrated into my social life. All of my friends have accepted him warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his case, he has a few friends who are equally good friends with him and his ex-wife and are trying to maintain a relationship with both. There are two women in particular who are slightly closer to his ex-wife than they are to him. They are both still his friends, but have said that they don’t want to hang out with me at all because that feels disloyal to his ex-wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one woman I don’t have so much of a problem with because he only sees her when he is with her entire family, including her husband and kids. I mean, it doesn’t feel great to be excluded, but I understand that it’s about his kids’ relationship with her kids as much as anything else so I can live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other woman really grinds my gears. She wants to hang out with him one on one. They went out for a late dinner at a nice restaurant last year for example, and he said that I couldn’t come because she wouldn’t feel comfortable with it. I told him that was fine, but I don’t feel comfortable with this kind of thing occurring regularly with her unless she is willing to include me at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other nuance to this is that I’ve actually known her for many years because their kids went to grade school in middle school together. She was always very rude and dismissive to me. She is a wealthy, fancy person and really seems to spend a lot of time on her appearance. I am a bit plainer by choice. I always had the impression that she thought I was too frumpy and homely to be in her friend group. Interestingly, I mentioned this to my boyfriend and said that I was maybe mistaken in my impression and reading her signals wrong — and he said probably not; that’s kind of how she is!! \n",
      "\n",
      "When they went out and he told her we were together, she claimed that she had no idea who I was, and had never met me as far as she could remember, that my name didn’t even ring a bell. To me this is either a lie to make me seem unimportant or it’s the truth and she was really so dismissive with me that I made no impression on her despite having met her 30 or 40 times over the course of a decade. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn’t like that when he told her we were dating and showed her a picture of me, she said “oh that doesn’t seem like your type; I thought you would go for someone based on more superficial qualities.” His interpretation was that somehow this was a compliment implying that I was more of a natural beauty and not over processed… given my history with her. I feel like it was more like she wanted to tell him that I’m homely but knew she couldn’t get away with just saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also told him she was disappointed that he was committing himself to a monogamous relationship because in her view, humans aren’t meant to be monogamous and that he would have more fun sleeping around.\n",

      "\n",
      "I will say I don’t think either of them actually have any intention of hooking up. I do believe that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will also say that he has been scrupulously honest. If he wanted to hook up with her, it would be incredibly easy for him to do since we don’t live together or keep tabs on each other. He could have chosen not to mention meeting with her or could have chosen to edit his recap of their dinner in a less incriminating way. I am grateful for the honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what I’m struggling to get him to understand is that even if I 100% trust him not to do anything with her, the whole situation still feels disrespectful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seems to somewhat understand, but we’re kind of an impasse of what to do next. He has agreed that next time she brings up getting together he will try to steer it towards a group situation that includes me. \n",

      "Title: How do I forgive the way our relationship started?\n",
      "Body text: I (25F) met my boyfriend (28M) 4.5 years ago. When we first met, he insisted he didn’t want a relationship, but liked me and wanted to keep seeing me casually. I agreed to this because I wasn’t sure what I wanted, and was happy to take it slow for a while. Increasingly, I found myself wanting a relationship with him, but he stayed firm in not wanting a relationship. Despite not wanting to be official, our ‘relationship’ was progressing as an official relationship would (increasingly we were meeting each others friends and family, and it was clear we both had feelings for each other). Nonetheless, he slept with several other people during this time, and I slept with one other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year, I couldn’t do it any more, and told him I either needed to be in a relationship or needed to break up. He agreed to a relationship, but a short time later said actually he couldn’t do it, and we broke up. We didn’t talk for a couple of months, then slowly started seeing each other again. Our relationship continued to progress, and eventually about four months later, he acknowledged that I was, for all intents and purposes, his girlfriend, and we might as well call a spade a spade. However, I was due to go away for several months that summer, and he asked that we keep it an open relationship, because he thought he’d struggle with me being away. I was okay with this, because I thought it’d be mutual, and I’d sleep with others too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut forward to Summer, once we were apart, and I realised I didn’t want to sleep with anyone else, and the idea of him sleeping with others bothered me. I phoned him and told him. He said he hadn’t yet slept with others but the idea of not being able to was a problem for him and we might need to break up. I said, if the only option was to break up, we’d have to break up. I was sad about that, but genuinely felt that the only options for me were to be exclusive or to break up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed to give each other space and didn’t really talk for a few days, and after a few days he phoned and said he’d like to be exclusive. However, after I arrived home, he told me in person that over those few days he’d slept with someone else. He said sleeping with someone else had made him realise he only wanted me. I was hurt, but felt I could move on if it meant we were going to be in an exclusive relationship moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward 3 years to today, and he’s the most amazing boyfriend. He is gentle, caring, considerate. He goes above and beyond to respond to my needs, as I do his. I can’t fault our relationship as it is now. I’m certain he is who I want to be with forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, I don’t think I’ve ever really gotten over the way our relationship started, and it’s started to really interfere with how I feel about him. I often feel angry at him, and like I’ve never really got a sense of empowerment back after trampling all over my own boundaries by agreeing to proceed with the relationship. I really want to put the past behind me and move on, because I think we have something really good, but I don’t know how to get rid of the anger beneath the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the only way to get past it is if we communicate openly about it, but I don’t really know how to do that, or what I need from him. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for moving on from a past hurt in a relationship, particularly one where you feel like you’ve compromised yourself, and can’t get back a sense of personal power?\n",

      "\n",
      "Long story short, my gf and I have been dating for two and a half years. She is 30 and im 26. We have never had a “good time” in our relationship. In the beginning stages, I was still living with my homophobic family and in nursing school, I let her know it would not be easy and school is a priority, she agreed. However our relationship became so strained she asked me to move in, once I decided to tell my parents and move in, she said she would be scared to cheat on me and wanted to be honest. So we broke up This has happened three times, each time we got back together, i would get incredibly anxious she would do it again I would start fights and need to figure out if she would leave me again. each time we broke up, she would date someone new in a week. I have a huge abandonment wound from this and each time she asked for me back, I would hound her with questions, ask every other second if she loved me, and would accuse her of leaving me again. It caused so many fights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently we have been together and it’s been nothing but fights since December. I feel awful she broke last month and said she feels like a shell of a human, I told her we can still work past this. My brother just recently got diagnosed with cancer, so naturally I feel emotionally vulnerable, yet she has still stayed. It completely wiped away the past of her leaving me when I needed her most. But is now saying I drain her energy, she has no good memories to hold onto, and she wants to break up but has not officially decided yet and waiting to see if the feeling goes away. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the root of the problem was needing to know she would not abandon me again like previous times and she does truly care. I now know she does, how can I reverse it and not drain her energy. I love her more than anything and the pain of the past definitely took a toll on us. \n",

      "Body text: TL;DR: Basically, I have a relationship with a girl that I like a lot; we have a very satisfying romantic life, but sex is almost always a problem. I have to initiate every time, and even when it gets going (once per month or less) the experience we have is kinda passionless and very clunky, for lack of a better word.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s not that we haven’t discussed the problem through the years: the conversation always started from me, and she’s always reluctant to talk about it (she’s not much for difficult psychological and emotional matters and she’s kinds shy). And through the years she gave many different reasons for her apparent disinterest in sex (or in sex with me). Most importantly, that she never was that interested in the thing in the first place (even though in the beginning she was the one pestering me because we weren’t having enough moments of physical intimacy), but also she talked about me not being 100% her type, e.g. she would like for me to have a more athletic, even muscular body, while I’m more of a chubby guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem is (and trust me, I’m not really bragging or anything here, I’m just trying to be as honest as possible) that I’m not at all an ugly dude: I’m very confident, I know how to fascinate a girl and I’ve had many occasions to be flirtatious with others -even unfaithful- but I’ve never been able to act upon them, because I’m just not that kind of person. God knows how hard it has been, with sexual satisfaction coming my way once a month or even less, and always under my solicitation.\n",

      "That is not to say that our feelings for each other aren’t the real deal and that’s what makes me feel so bad about this.

      "\n",
      "It’s just that… having basically no sexual life sometimes really hurts. I’m not at all an hyper-sexual guy, and in my mind it feels at times kinda base and petty to make such a big deal about sex, when everything else works well. But you know, what makes this even more aggravating is the fact that having to always initiate any moment of intimacy, and then seeing her mostly interested in having her needs satisfied, while being kinda not interested, or awkward and detached when it comes to my part of the deal… makes for a very miserable experience.\n",

I cried for hours and feel like my tears upset him, with him saying things like “You cry over the littlest things” or “If you start, I’m leaving.” We've almost broken up one time because he felt torn between me and work, but he later apologised and promised to make both work. I’m struggling because I feel unseen and unsupported, and I’m afraid that my emotions push him away. Has anyone else been in a relationship like this?

And instead of checking in, he replied, \"Please no\" \"Not tonight\" \"Should I call you later?\" At this point my heart broke because I really needed to talk about something we had an argument about earlier this week so I told him I need space instead and I didn't think a call would help me right now. To which he replies: Ok, don't overthink things.\n",
      "* **Hours of tears.** That response crushed me. I cried for almost two hours straight and I’m terrified that if he *does* see me crying, he’ll pull back even further.\n",
      "* **“You cry over the littlest things.”** When I do cry, he tells me I need to stop—“you cry over the smallest stuff.” My own mom has said that I do that, and it leaves me feeling invalidated and ashamed. Not that I don't think I should cry but I know that's how I process my emotions but if two people have said the same thing, I was willing to put in the effort to control my tears if that meant I was hurting him because he said every time I cried, he'd feel like a piece of shit.\n",
      "* **Dinner meltdown.** One evening I started crying at the table, and he literally walked away mid-meal. I sat there crying alone while he left, took a shower, and went to his room. He didn't even have dinner even though he said he was hungry before everything happened.\n",
      "* **Hurtful ultimatums.** Sometimes when I tear up, he says things like, “If you start, I’m leaving,” which makes me feel so horrible.\n",
      "* **The almost-breakup.** He once said he needed to choose between me and his work and suggested a break—*he* initiated it. But an hour later he came back, apologised, and said he’d been wrong to choose. He promised he wants both of me and his work so he'd try to make things work. I *do* see him trying in moments like that, and I appreciate it.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "Hi everyone, I (24F) really need some support or advice on this. I apologize to dump on everyone but I am genuinely concerned about my husband (27M). \n",
      "\n",
      "He has always been drinking, since around 14 years old he started and pretty heavily. \n",
      "I have noticed his eyes have a yellowish hue, he doesn’t want to leave the house anymore and the only reason he does leave the house is to buy a 6 pack of beer. On weekdays after work, he stays 1-2 hours drinking and smoking with coworkers. He has admitted drunkenly to me that he can’t go a shift at the restaurant without a beer, or various for that matter. It also affects him financially, he saves little to no money but is responsible with his bills. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t just want to leave him, I’m honestly afraid he will either die drinking or do it on purpose, he has threatened that before. \n",
      "but my options are becoming ever more slim, and I am seeing a rapid decline in interest to go out and do much of anything. Today was a beautiful day and he decided to sit inside, exhausted and just went out for a pack of beer. \n",
      "I am honestly at a breaking point myself, mentally and physically. Chores, planning schedules etc are done by me, since he is normally exhausted or hungover. We both work the same amount of hours every week but I still am able to pull through and manage the house/bills/errands/appointments and go and play with our children. \n",
      "Please no rude comments, I just need some clarity or advice about what to do in this situation. I feel lost, stuck and upset about it all. I have commented he needs professional help but has denied it. Thanks for reading and your time. \n",

      "\n",
      "Today has been hard, and a bit scary. \n",
      "I am currently on maternity leave and so have pretty much 24/7 caring responsibilities for baby apart from the 3 hours a week that I insist on to going to local gym classes (I need this space/time to myself and I’m actively losing baby weight to feel better about myself). I sort all the baby clothes, general health, food prep/ensuring we have formula in and pretty much everything that comes with parenthood. I also make sure our dog is walked everyday and has everything she needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the household chores have fallen to me, he reluctantly does things if I ask him…however he will say that I’m nagging him to do things. In the entirety of our relationship he has cleaned the bathroom maybe 5 times, hoovered/mopped 10 times and generally cleaned the house pretty much never without prompting. Same with clothes washing, I asked him the other day to bring the washing in from the line and he put it in a bag onto the sofa as if the magic clothes fairy was going to whisk it upstairs and put it away.\n",
      "Now, I love him he is a caring guy and is great with our son. But his input is playing with him for an hour or two after work, sometimes he will get up whilst I have an extra 30 mins in bed in the morning to feed baby when he wakes up…but I have to ask him to dress him for the day. He doesn’t think to give him breakfast an hour or so after the first bottle, he’s ’waiting for him to get hungry’ and doesn’t realise you can pre-empt that, I’m not sure he’s ever visited a parenting website or read any books for background knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess what I’m getting at is he doesn’t appreciate the amount I do and the mental load it is to care for another human, I appreciate I am on maternity leave and so have an extra 40 hours but it’s not like this is chill out time for me, I have an 9 month crawler (nearly walker) to keep safe and happy, and a very active dog to keep happy and settled.\n",

      "A slightly biased background but true all the same.\n",

      "The aspects of the situation at the moment is his Gran sadly died and we are potentially buying her house, although we had a survey done and there is a lot more money that needs to make it safe and modernised- money that is coming from my parents and the sale of my house (he is not on the mortgage) both my parents and I are dubious on affordability and he is adamant he wants this house for us despite being able to contribute very little to the purchase.\n",
      "Also, to get a mortgage he has taken on a job recently where his colleagues are lazy and clueless and he feels he is picking up the slack. \n",
      "He has also had a car insurance claim on an  incident that happened a year or so ago come through, it’s clear he is not liable but as he is on business insurance with his Dad it might increase his payments.\n",
      "All these things are stressing him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today he was sorting out stuff to make the house we are in saleable (he is finishing a project in the garden that he started 3 years ago) and was driving here and there to get supplies. We met at a pub whilst I was walking the dog, and it was somewhat strained - I could tell he was stressed but he didn’t say anything so we were just having a reasonably pleasant drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to this evening when he said he would make our evening meal, but instead cleaned the BBQ whilst I bathed and our baby to bed and didn’t make the meal. I questioned him whether he was going to cook, and also brought up the way he had spoken to me regarding taking out a subscription to Disney, as if it was unacceptable for me to sign up to this out of my own money. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got annoyed with each other and I said ‘fuck this I’m done, I don’t want to talk about it’ and went upstairs. He lost his shit, screaming and shouting, punching the wall and broke 2 TV remotes. I think he was also drinking most of the day, although I wasn’t in some of the day so I don’t know how much he had. Anyways, I was upstairs and took my bedding into baby’s room as well as the dog who he let upstairs whilst shouting - poor thing was shaking and cuddled up to me.\n",
      "After about 15 minutes of hearing him from upstairs I went down to make sure he wasn’t going to hurt himself or anything. He has tears in his eyes but when we spoke he said it was my fault and my actions bringing up how he spoke to me that tipped him over the edge, he has never flipped out like that since I met him. Sure we had had the odd (rare) falling out and arguing, but what relationship hasn’t,\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I was insensitive but he didn’t express to me how stressed he felt or how I could help before he blew his top. I don’t know whether it was my fault, and more importantly whether I should accept this behaviour in our relationship. He has made me feel uncomfortable, so much so that I had to go into our sons room and whilst I type this I kind of want to bring our son into the bed with me. \n",

      "Body text: I (F39) have been with my husband (M44) for nearly 13 years. We met at work, and during a team night out, he mentioned that he would always love his ex, who broke up with him years ago. A few years later, after a drunken night, we ended up hooking up and quickly developed feelings for each other. However, on a date, he stated that he will always have some feelings for his ex and felt it was refreshing that he can openly talk to me about them, which raised some red flags for me, but I pushed them aside because I really liked him.  \n",

      "After many happy years together - we got engaged, bought a house, and had our first child. Initially, I didn’t mind him being connected to his ex on Facebook, but things changed when his cousin found boxes of his ex’s belongings in his mother’s garage and returned them to her. His anger over that surprised me, revealing he had clearly been hoarding those items. Months later, while planning our wedding, he received an invite to his ex’s wedding. I told him it felt uncomfortable for him to attend, so he ultimately declined the invitation.  \n",

      "A few weeks later, while he was showing me something on his phone, I saw her name as a recent contact. I don’t usually check his phone, but I felt had to the next morning.

We’ve since married, and while I know I should talk to him about this, I’m ashamed that I went through his phone and it may break the trust between us. \n",

She of course just sits in bed most of the day, watching YouTube, sleeping, or playing Minecraft, and not much else. When I told her I wanted to see where the possibility of the new girl went, she said she was going to write some notes and end her life.

      "Title: My (35F) husband (56M) struggles with trust issues when he is triggered. This serves to trigger my own personal sensitivities which creates a painful cycle of reactivity. HELP!\n",
      "Body text: I (35F) have been married to my husband (56M) a little under 6 months after dating for 3 years. Our relationship is largely a great one and we love each other deeply. We are both living together, financially stable, highly educated and at the tops of our careers. No kids. However, there have been several moments in the past (and now, the present) where he experiences emotional triggers due to past trauma borne from his neglectful parents and emotionally abusive previous partners. He is particularly sensitive to not being listened to or neglected, not being taken seriously or being laughed at/demeaned. Generally, in an argument, he perceives that I engage in these imagined instances of attack to personally hurt him and then goes on the defense as a response. He reacts very immediately (super quick break-neck micro-second emotional changes from being happy to being upset or hurt), is quite harsh in his emotional defensive strikes and is slow to return to reason and regain control. Unfortunately, my partner's reactive tendencies trigger my own past issues with false accusations/emotional projections from family members, feeling intense pressure to defend myself or perform perfection as a way of protecting myself and experiencing chronic low self esteem and helplessness in the face of a now cold and detached loved one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture of our arguments looks roughly like this (I call it the Belt and Snake Trigger Cycle):\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Says or does something not meant AT ALL to be malicious or done/said by mistake (Like as if he has seen a Belt on the road in his path).\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Perceives this as something intentionally and personally done to hurt him to bring him down or belittle him. Goes on the attack and accuses me of being neglectful, distrustful, manipulative and/or hostile (Based on the fact that he has had many negative experiences with Snakes in the past that have bitten him, he erroneously believes the Belt is a Snake and reacts with strong defensive violence).\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Spends hours or even days explaining how my behavior was not at all meant in a way to hurt him. He is often very resistant to my pleas so it takes so long to make him see reason and fact. My defense always hinges on how after 3 years, he MUST know by now that I am not the person he paints me to be and how my very good track record as a girlfriend and wife (which he agrees is very good) should be proof that I have never engaged in that behavior and would never DREAM of not taking him seriously or whatever he has accused me of. In my defense, I do my very best to reason with him with logic by emphasizing the facts surrounding the argument but by the end, I always end up in a torrent of tears, frustration and pain because the process of defending myself is so energy-consuming and reminds me of the many MANY years my family misunderstood and mistreated me for really no reason other than being a punching bag for their projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Eventually, he relents and understands where he misunderstood, sincerely apologizes and vows to work on his emotional triggers. He is very thankful for \"showing him how much I care about him\" and for fighting so hard for our relationship. But the damage is done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: After the argument is resolved, I'm a broken, emotionally exhausted, deeply distressed and triggered mess who feels aggrieved at being accused at all, given how hard I try to support him towards his goal of being more open and trusting of others. I withdraw completely, twice having seismic panic attacks, reliving memories (and sometimes vivid nightmares) of past traumatic incidences where everyone tells me, \"It's all your fault. You were never good enough...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Tries his best to comfort me but honestly, fails at reassuring me that this won't happen again. As far as he is concerned, the matter is resolved and we should move on. To him, this is a totally normal way of dealing with relationship issues (apparently he's had it worse with past partners) and the fact that he is improving over the last two years means things are actually moving in a positive direction overall! \\*thumbs up\\* He has no plans to leave the relationship and I am the love of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I don't think I have it in me to normalize and continue down this painful cycle of reactivity. I have done a lot of emotional shadow work to address my own personal sensitivities (been in therapy since I was 19) so I am able to extend a lot of empathy, patience and understanding when he acts like this. It's the only way I have been able to be rational and not join him while he is spinning off his axis during a triggered episode. I completely concede and celebrate with him on how he has genuinely made big strides of progress in the last 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a recent argument has left me absolutely broken. Yet another miscommunication led him to level the worst accusation against me yet-- he regrets ever trusting me and that I have been lying to him about who I truly am since the day I met him. To me, this is beyond the pale. I cannot accept that, even in his most irrational state, he can believe in that I am truly The Enemy and that I am a grand manipulator here to destroy him. While he regrets saying it now and says I am actually the only one he trusts, I am still devastated. I don't think I can continue with someone who thinks a mistake or misunderstanding should open a trap door to Hell under someone they love. How do I get out of this vicious cycle?\n",

She was emotionally abusive and at one point physically abusive to the point she got arrested during our separation and divorce.

We live together in the house that I lived in for less than a year with my ex wife before I found out about the affair and the divorce process started and she keeps referring to it as \"the house you two bought\".  I wanted the house.  I went had to convince my ex to get it and go out on a limb to get it.  I wanted it.  She never did.

      "The way his employer treated him was, in our view (and our lawyers' view) clearly disability discrimination -- that's a whole other story. But he has engaged lawyers to act on his behalf to sue his employers and hasn't worked since, meaning he hasn't been paid since his breakdown. He also hasn't sought out any other work (which I understand is in his best interests both from a legal and health perspective).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the problems I'm currently facing:\n",
      "1) I hate to say it, but my husband doesn't contribute much around the house. He might tidy the kitchen in the mornings and feeds our cats, but that's about it. So not only am I the only one working, and therefore paying for everything, but I'm also doing most of the chores as well. I also have a physical disability, so this extra workload is wreaking havoc on my body. I already had the majority of the mental load, as I'm the \"household manager\". My husband says he is unable to contribute more due to his mental health issues, and neither is he able to discuss chores or chores allocation for the same reason. He has basically spent the last 6 months playing video games, and doing little else (except the odd meeting with lawyers).\n",
      "2) We can just about scrape by on my salary alone (which I'm extremely grateful for), if we were to budget carefully. I have extreme money anxiety due to previous trauma, but have made steps to organise our finances better. Again, my husband refuses to have a serious talk about money because it's triggering for him. This unfortunately also means that he puts off telling me about the latest legal bill until they've made a final demand for payment. He also withdraws money from our bank account used for handling bills, and often buys cigarettes and snacks, and doesn't tell me, leading to more than one occasion where our mortgage provider has sent threatening messages because there's not enough money in the account for that month's mortgage payment. I've asked my husband to tell me when he makes such withdrawals, and/or to keep an itemised list of when he makes such withdrawals, but he says he doesn't want to stress me out. He also says he feels shame and anxiety at the thought of keeping a list. I offered to give him \"pocket money\", but such idea disgusts him.\n",
      "3) We've previously been excellent at communicating with each other, but any attempts to communicate about serious topics now results in him getting depressed and hiding away, refusing to talk. I'm trying to be as compassionate and supportive as possible, but it often feels like nothing is working, and there is no improvement on his end. Whilst he has just started therapy (yay), he seeks me out for immediate support when he's feeling low or having a panic attack, including when I'm supposed to be working.\n",
      "4) Whenever he comes across any issues in his day-to-day, he will delegate it to me. At one point he tried to \"sign away\" all responsibility to handle his legal matters to me, but I simply could not feasibly do this and handle my day job at the same time. Otherwise, I am responsible for his medical appointments, filling out paperwork, etc. I'm exhausted, but if I don't do these things, he accuses me of not being supportive.\n",
      "5) Things just aren't fun anymore. I think I've laughed 5 times in the last 6 months. My husband gets panic attacks or gets irritable if I suggest we do something together, so I've stopped making plans for the weekend or beyond. Quite frankly, I'm too exhausted to do anything anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do. I can feel myself slipping, mentally. Outside my husband and the limited roles of my therapist, doctor, and social services, I don't have a support network. Whilst I completely sympathise with my husband's mental health issues, it often feels like his mental health is taking absolute priority over mine, but he's also not doing anything to help improve his mental health. I kinda feel like that \"This is fine\" cartoon dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do? How do we address these issues without him running away, having an autistic meltdown, or other unpleasant reaction? How do I stand my ground on the fact that I simply cannot do everything alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My husband has been in a pit of despair for the last 6 months and is sapping our finances. He assigns almost all responsibility (regarding financial and household maintenance, his emotional and physical needs, etc) to solely me. This is unsustainable and we desperately need to discuss, but any attempts to have a serious conversation are shut down because they're too difficult for him.\n",

      "Title: I overshared about my relationship and now I deeply regret it — how do I fix this?\n",
      "Body text: So I (19F) started seeing this guy (21M) a little over a year ago. For both of us, it was the first time something felt this deep and meaningful. In the beginning, I had a habit of talking to my close friends and family about almost everything that was happening in the relationship — good, bad, and in-between. I didn't really see anything wrong with it at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, on the other hand, was much more private. He only talked about us with people he deeply trusted — mostly just his close friends and relatives. He used to say things like, “I’ve realized from past experiences that if you have something beautiful, people are bound to ruin it, so I’d rather keep it to myself.” Back then, I didn’t really understand where he was coming from.\n",

      "But now, after everything we've been through, I do. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, and recently I’ve started to feel like way too many people know things that I wish I had kept between just us. Some of the intimacy feels lost. And what makes it worse is that now people have a bad image of him in their heads — based on moments I vented about, not the full picture. I’ve realized I subconsciously overshared — maybe out of needing support or validation — but now I really regret it.\n",

      "Title: Feel like my (31M) girlfriend (28F) has given up on her appearance\n",
      "Body text: I feel bad even posting this, but I'm nearing my wits end, and I worry about the possible repercussions of asking friends for advice - I don't want what I'm saying to change anyone's perception of my girlfriend or me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been going out for 4 years now, living together for 2. Shortly after moving in together, I started to notice a slow, steady change in our relationship. We used to get dressed up and go out together once or twice a week, we used to go to the gym together 2 or 3 times a week, and we used to have great sex a couple times a week. My girlfriend was also in a running club, did pole fitness, and was into doing big weird expressive makeup looks as a hobby, all of which I loved about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then my girlfriend has given up on the gym completely, mostly can't be bothered going out, and usually makes minimal effort when we do. She also rarely wants to have sex (maybe a couple times a month at most) and doesn't seem all that present or enthusiastic when we do - I don't think she's been the one to initiate in over a year now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's also really given up on wearing makeup, dressing nice, or even really looking after her appearance generally. It's sweatpants and cargos with a hoodie every day, and she's gained a noticeable amount of weight over the last two years. I still think she's beautiful, but I miss seeing her all dressed up - once or twice a year we're invited to a wedding or a posh meal and she really makes a go of it, and I'm completely blown away by how gorgeous she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, I still go to the gym at least four times a week (it was her that really got me into going), I've really developed my sense of style, gotten pretty consistent with my diet and grooming, and without wanting to sound conceited, right now I'm easily the best-looking I've ever been. I'm getting attention and flirtatious comments from strangers in a way that has really never happened to me before, and family and friends have remarked on how much I've \"glowed up\", but if anything it makes me feel even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love her so much, and there are so many things about our relationship that I cherish, but the longer this goes on the more I worry it will never change. The lack of effort she makes with herself makes me feel rejected and taken for granted, and her lack of enthusiasm around sex makes me worry if she's still physically attracted to me at all. I've tried to gently broach the topic, and I really try to encourage her when she does make an effort, but it hasn't made any difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "To preempt some obvious comments: I don't think this is a mental health thing - by all accounts she's doing better now than she was when we first started going out. She has a less stressful and better paid job, we have a better circle of friends, and we have a beautiful home together. I remember having to regularly support her emotionally around work and friendship/flatmate drama in the first year or so of dating, and I still happily would, of course, but it seems like things are just a lot better in that respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hoping this doesn't all sound shallow and superficial. She deserves someone who makes the effort for her, and so do I. We're coming up on our 5 year anniversary in a few month's time, and I'm honestly starting to get really scared. I don't want to break up with her, but truthfully it makes me feel so unappreciated, and it hurts.\n",

      "How do I get her to understand that this is damaging our relationship without hurting her feelings?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tldr; I love my girlfriend but I feel like she's given up on her appearance, and stopped appreciating mine too.\n",

      "Body text: Thank you for reading if you’re here 🥲\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background: I’m 26F, living with my fiancé (28M) about an hour north of my mom. We recently bought a 3-bedroom house we’ve been remodeling ourselves. It’s still a work in progress—one room doesn’t even have drywall or flooring yet and is currently being used to store our tools and paint. Our bedroom is finished, but the guest room doesn’t even have a door yet (we still need to buy them) and is also doubling as a storage space. We live with our three cats. My little sister is 14F, and is about to graduate from 8th grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto my mom. She’s a pathological liar. It’s something I’ve tolerated for years because most of her lies are small and don’t cause major harm. But it still bothers everyone who knows her—she lies constantly, doubles down when questioned, and ends conversations instead of owning up to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, her lying became a serious issue. She was kicked out of the house where my sisters and I grew up, but she told everyone she had sold it voluntarily. She assured us she had somewhere to go. She didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I called her to check in during her “move,” she was panicked and said she needed help moving a U-Haul and her car. I rushed over after work and found the house in a terrible state—completely unprepared, dirty, and filled with trash bags. There was grime all over the floor, a fridge that looked like it hadn’t worked in years, and everything that couldn’t be moved alone was simply left behind: her bedroom set, my childhood room, my sister’s belongings—years of memories just abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She admitted she had nowhere to go. I did the only thing I could think of: I got her into one of the apartments owned by the company I worked for. I signed the lease myself, put it under my name, and paid the full deposit and rent out of pocket, knowing I wouldn’t see that money again. I even risked my job to get her off the street. She had just $40K coming in from the sale of the house but wouldn’t receive it for a few more days. She was in her car with my 12-year-old sister and their two dogs (a 5 lb chihuahua and a 200 lb mastiff), with nowhere to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister didn’t even know they were moving. When I picked her up, she was confused and asked if they were just going to check out a new place. My mom lied directly to her face and said they had just bought a new house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, my mom repaid me for the apartment, but she then moved into a rental house for $2,600/month—completely unaffordable. I begged her not to. I hated watching her spend what little money she had furnishing the entire place from scratch, but she ignored me. She bought everything new—beds, couches, TVs, pillows, blankets—all to replace the things she left behind. I hoped she could stabilize in 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to yesterday: I get a call from my mom. She has to be out of her rental by midnight. She claims she’s been paying rent but her landlord wasn’t paying the mortgage and the house is being reclaimed. She’s scrambling to move everything into a U-Haul. Once again, my sister knows nothing. My mom told my sister (WHILE SHE WAS MOVING HER SHIT INTO A UHAUL) that she would  leave the apartment unlocked so my sister and I could grab clothes for her dad’s house over the weekend. I ended up having to be the one to break the news: “Mom got kicked out. Everything is in a storage unit now.” My sister was devastated, unsure why my mom couldn’t be honest with her. My sister asked me if my mom had bothered to pack her bed. It makes me cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have the resources to help this time. I can’t house her, especially with the mastiff. We’re financially stretched thin from the remodel. My fiancé and I both work full-time and aren’t home during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister is heartbroken. She’s supposed to go on a weeklong school trip to DC on Tuesday. My mom promised to drive her and her friend to the school that day. Now we’re not even sure if her things were packed or left behind again. Had we known what was happening, we could’ve at least made sure she brought her essentials to her dad’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just at a complete loss. My mom lies so much I never know what’s real. I know the obvious answer is “don’t believe anything,” but how am I supposed to help someone like that? I have nothing left to give, but I hate watching my sister go through this. I’m heartbroken and disappointed beyond words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to be honest, refuses to take accountability, and seems to believe that if she ignores her problems long enough, a miracle will fix them. But no miracle comes. And now my little sister, once again, is the one suffering the consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR my mom has lied about her situation until she’s literally in dire need of help, losing all of her possessions and living in her car. My little sister is losing everything she owns, and my mom will not have a rational conversation or come to terms with her situation. Can I do anything to help? \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT TO ADD: my sister stays with me every other weekend, just to hang out and spend time together. She’s sleeping in my guest room right now, and I’m meeting her dad tonight so she can spend the rest of the week at his house. \n",

Then I jokingly asked “Did you do something funny with that girl?” And man…in that moment I’ve seen the life getting out of her and I knew it. She then confessed everything..that they were just friends and at the start of march she started to have feelings for her and they were intimate from the first days (this started before our 5th anniversary) and it kept going until she came back home. On the last night there she got herself drunk just because she was leaving that place. Also, she told me that when I proposed to her that she was scared and she started to think if she has attachment issues because she feels she couldn’t be with anyone forever because maybe that’s how she is as a person. \n",

      "At this moment I’m a complete mess..she suggesed to go to therapy together and we did our first session and she said that she forgot half of what it was discussed there and even if we are scheduled for the 2nd I don’t know what to say. After I found out she started to be cold in my presence. We are talking, maybe even laughing a little but not touching, kissing, anything. She started a little bit to get touchy like holding hands outside or a little hug, but a kiss maybe a veery very small one. \n",
      "\n",
      "The breakdown? Yesterday evening before bed I heard her phone pop up and it was that girl. She said they were not talking anymore but here we are. The most f’up part? She told me that she misses her and she’s thinking daily about her and what she’s doing. How can you tell your fiancee and bf of 5 years that you miss the person you cheated with? Because she cheated also emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to sleep but I couldn’t. I went to the kitchen to smoke (4months without ciggarettes until she told me) and I started to feel my heart pounding out of my chest like I was going to have a heart attack. It hurt so much and I don’t know if it also hurt physically but I don’t know if I ever felt that pain. In the end I managed to fall asleep trying to calm myself to understand that the pain is not real and it’s just mentally. \n",

I loved and love this girl with all my heart and she made me feel something that no one else could and I want to make things fine, but I’m not so sure about her. She looks like at a point she would try with baby-steps and in another that ca’t get past what happened. \n",

      "\n",
      "He's 30s M, I'm 30s F. Together over 10 years. One teenager. Dogs/cats in home. He's an on call worker. He is supposed to be on call Sunday night to Friday night, unless coverage is needed on weekends. Sometimes he gets multiple calls a day, rarely none in a week. Sometimes he is out of the house all day, sometimes just an hour. I do a regular 40 hour work week, plus do his job with him casually on the evenings and weekends if coverage is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week he was gone for a work retreat all week. Lots of fun and dicking around and lots of planning/paperwork stuff. I held the fort. He'd been on call before this for about 10 days straight. He came back, and I went on call with him for the weekend. We spent a lot of time together that weekend both working and at home. He is on call until this Friday. He has basically been on call for 3 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he is home, he spends a lot of time on the computer. When he is off call, he does not really want to do anything other than get groceries. He does not really want to leave the house to go for walks. He likes doing his in-house hobbies, which are mostly either solitary or are things that don't rock my world. To be vague, he likes playing music, gaming, watching TV. I don't like watching TV but I do it to be with him. I watched sports with him all weekend to hang out. Our gaming interests are pretty opposite. I really like walking and being outside. I am the primary person who works with our dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like going and playing board games in a group too. I go maybe every 3 weeks, or less. This is pretty much the only outside-the-house \"my friend\" stuff that I'm doing currently. I wanted to go tomorrow. He got pretty upset today when I told him I was going. He wanted to spend time together now that he is off work for the first time in forever. I feel like we have spent the whole week together and it's been mostly me sitting around and feeling burned out while he games. I went to work with him last weekend specifically because I missed him when he was gone. I tried to express that to him but he says I'm ignoring and invalidating his feelings basically, and maybe I am. He is very upset with me and says I should just go to the game night, but also that he is hurt, disappointed, angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so burned out from my stressful job and doing the same old 65% of the around the house duties that I always do and that he tells me doesn't have to be done. I do 3miles a day walking AT LEAST with all these dogs, who I love, but who were his choice, then I hit the gym because it's one of the only things I know -I- like doing. The kid, his choice. The things we do together, his choice/his hobbies. I don't know who \"me\" is sometimes. I don't know how to express this in a way that isn't hurtful to him. I don't know if I'm rational, I don't know if I'm right or wrong. I'm burned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot to our relationship, I love him, it's been many years. I'm just expressing the bad stuff now. I guess - feelings aren't wrong - I'm not looking for everyone to say he's wrong. I don't think he's wrong for feeling this way. But it doesn't feel fair to hold it against me. I just wanted to have fun. The guy hates board games, lol. I want to have fun and do something I like... \n",

      "Body text: **TL;DR (33M) with (35F) girlfriend of 4 years. Gave up PhD for our relationship. Still jobless 8 months later. She’s emotionally drained and gave me an ultimatum: get a job offer this week or move out. Unsure if this relationship is still salvageable. We share the same long-term goals, but I’m currently unable to give her the short-term stability she needs. Looking for advice on whether to stay or go when love is there but timing feels off.**\n",
      "\n",
      "My (33M) girlfriend (35F) and I have reached a critical point after 4 years together. We met when I was a Master's student and continued as I began a PhD in statistics. During my second year, she gave me an ultimatum—either her or the PhD. She was tired of being a successful healthcare provider earning a good income while I was a 30-year-old grad student surviving on $30k a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I truly believed in our relationship and had doubts about pursuing an academic career, given today’s job market. So, I left with a Master's degree. I felt confident about transitioning to industry after speaking with friends in tech, who convinced me I'd easily secure an entry-level data role. Unfortunately, that turned out to be incorrect, and after eight months of job searching, I'm still unemployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time, my partner has expressed dissatisfaction watching her friends marry, buy houses, and have children while we couldn't move forward. Our love has sustained us through these struggles, but her unhappiness gradually intensified. Over the past months, it became clear she was deeply depressed. I encouraged her to seek professional help, and although she initially seemed open, she ultimately declined due to the cost, despite being able to afford it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month, things worsened significantly. She struggled to sleep and frequently burst into tears. Neither of us fully understood if our relationship was causing her depression or if the relationship issues were symptoms of it. Our good times became less frequent as her depressive episodes grew closer and more intense.\n",
      "\n",

      "I genuinely understand her perspective and don't judge her, but maybe reaching this point means a fresh start is best. However, we rarely fought aside from issues surrounding my inability to contribute financially toward our future.\n",

      "Currently, I tutor part-time, making about $1500-2000/month. I have a friend looking for an apartment, but two-bedroom rentals here start at $2000/month, which might be unaffordable. Alternatively, I could move back with my parents several hours away, but I'd lose my tutoring income, which requires me to be local.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have an interview for a promising government job in early June, but it could be months before that materializes, if at all.

      "Body text: I ‘35M’ find myself in a tough spot. I’ve been seeing this woman ‘33F’ for about 7 months. We had both had come out of long term relationships and we both agreed to take things slow and not to label anything. Inevitably we both caught feelings and while I’ve asked her to make things official she’s told me on several occasions that while she enjoys spending time with me she does not want to commit because of my communication skills. To her credit I did have some problematic behaviors that I have since addressed and made major improvements. I’ve been in therapy, have learned how to communicate, such as not making assumptions, asking clarifying questions, not raising my voice, giving each other space when things get heated. I’ve also learned how to regulate my emotions and so on. While my behavior isn’t perfect, I’ve come a very long way. She on the other had had a difficult time accepting that she has resorted to some problematic behaviors such as defensiveness, deflection, resorting to sarcasm and teasing when I’m trying to have serious conversions. I’ve tried to address this with her and it hasn’t been very easy. She also lacks accountability a lot of the time. So when she puts it on me as for the reason being my lack of communication skills that she doesn’t want to commit it feels like a slap in the face. I told her I was heart broken but that I accepted it and thanked her for the honesty and told her I can no longer continue things and wished her the best. The next day she texts me trying to explain herself that she didn’t appreciate that I’ve called her avoidant and cruel (although I stop doing so months ago after she voiced that out). She also said that she always felt like she could never meet the level of affection that I wanted. I responded by letting her know that her level of affection was never an issue, I validated her feeling and the position I put her in while navigating my previous toxic behaviors but that I could not longer stay in this and keep hiding our relationship. She kept saying that I wanted to go from 0 to 100, it honestly felt like I was being gaslit. She was bothered that I wasn’t telling ppl that I was seeing someone but I explained to her that I didn’t want to because she was always very hot and cold with me and that I didn’t want to ruin her image before we even commit to each other. She then tells me she’s sick and like a dumbass I offer to come over and take care of her which she agreed to. And now it’s back to how things were before. The reality is that I cannot do this anymore. I feel like a placeholder and just plain being used. I just don’t know what to do. Can someone please give me some advice on how to leave this toxic situation. Thank you.\n",

      "Body text: I guess I am one of the new fencers and would love to get your thoughts, maybe a help to think in some direction. To give you a context: Me, F(32) and my BF (33) have been together for 2 years, in a very committed relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A bit about my bf:** He is an amazing person, very kind, calm and caring, especially to me. He is an introvert and never was into parties/crazy lifestyle. I'm also introvert, but more active and social. Since he moved in with me, he has become even more thoughtful and considerate. Sometimes I think that every day he learns something new, observes me so he can make me happier in what he does. He is a very chill person though and he wants to continue having this kind of lifestyle: work, his hobby (investments, learning) and traveling with me. BTW, he has become a bit more active after meeting me: started going to gym, doing more outdoors activities or cultural events. Things that he said about. that he would never do, he actually he quite enjoys now with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember on our first date, he mentioned that he would discuss having a kind even adopting with his partner - this quite stuck in my mind as I thought he was happy to have kids. On our first year, I brought the topic of having kids and he said he didn't know, at that moment he wasn't ready and maybe in the future this would change. We spoke about it again after some time, the answer was the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons he mentions are: I never thought about it, I had never had a pressure from my family to have kids. I want to have flexibility and time to do things whenever we want to - eg simple things (Walking, brunch, traveling etc). He would come a bit defensive if I'd push - I've noticed that he is defensive or gets a bit emotional, when he discusses the topics about religion, or the things that in his society people would prescribe to everyone as a written rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked him what is the purpose of your life, he said that it's me. That felt good, but on the other side, I felt extremely anxious when he said that he doesn't want to give me a fake hope and he wants me to be happy. So, I should do whatever I feel it right to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, I am torn because up until 2 years ago, I was living with the mindset - work, family and having kids. Never in my 20s any woman said to me that they didn't want to have kids. Maybe only oce I heard it and I was shocked - \"how a woman would not want to have kids?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was never considering this to be an option, and now when I see that as a possibility it confuses even more. I do have a social pressure from my culture, friends there but also, if you'd give me a kid now, I would obviously do anything for them, but I think I have become too lazy or always tired even to take care of myself.. Although I have a fear that in 40s I would lose interest in things, resent my partner and regret not having kids as I would not have this experience of being a mum.\n",

      "**TL;DR:** My boyfriend wants chill life, doesn't want to complicate it with having kids. He wants to keep enjoying it with me. I am baffled and not sure what to do - breaking up with him is the worst nightmare I could have. I sometimes think, maybe it's not a bad idea to have the life for yourself, but the social pressure and the way I was raised impacts my thought process a lot. Also, sometimes I am stuck of not having a purpose in life (I don't want to have kids just for that sake though). Anyone to share anything to help me with this dilemma?

      "Body text: Hi, I 19f, and my bf 20m have been dating for three years, we moved in together around a year ago. Before that we were mostly long distance. About a year into the relationship he told me that he didn't love me anymore, he said \"you get in my way of living the life I want to have\" so we broke up for a few months. Eventually we got back together and talked it out. He claims that he was being emotional and he didn't mean what he said, and things went back to normal for the most part. But ever since then I've had this nagging feeling in my gut that he really doesn't love, and this year I feel really proved my point. \n",
      "\n",
      "we argue almost daily now, I'm usually the one starting them because he would go against my wishes constantly, for example he loves hanging out with his friend, perfectly normal, I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is the way that he'll say \"I'll be back in an hour\" then drive across the city, for hours. No texts, no calls, nothing. Then he'll get back home, ignore me for at least a couple more hours to play video games, then finally get into bed and ignore me once again to turn into the corner and just watch Instagram till he falls asleep. Mind you this is almost every single night, and every single day he would ignore me at least once.\n",
      "\n",
      "his from of ignoring me is, 1. No reply when I say something or ask a question. I can ask over and over and there won't be a response, I can get closer or louder and it's the same thing. i know he hears me because this man can hear a spoon drop from the other side of the apartment, so I don't know why he won't respond to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. We will constantly go over my boundaries, I'm talking, multiple times a day where I have to remind him to be nice to me, it's like I have to re teach him that I'm a human with human emotions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know a little more about me and him I'll tell you about what made me write here. We had an argument a day or 2 ago, in this argument after he left for his family's place for a few days. I told him I was upset because he would play games with this family member, he would make jokes with him, he would cry on his shoulder, he would constantly talk to him for hours when he can only talk to me for 20 minutes before he just starts to ignore me again. I told him this and after a few minutes of me trying to tell him how much it hurt to see him act the way I've been begging him to act for the past year, and see him do it so easily too, I laughed and said something along the lines of \"I beg you to talk to me and you act like it's impossible for you\" I laughed a little and he mocked my laugh (something I have repeatedly told him not to do, I had an abusive father that would do that to taunt me the majority of my life, he's heard me cry over it so he knows how It would make me feel)\n",
      "\n",

      "Body text: I’m 29M.. my girlfriend is 38F. We’ve been together for two and a half years and honestly, it’s been amazing. Peaceful, grounded, mature. I’ve never felt more comfortable in a relationship. We don’t live together.. we have our own spaces, our own lives, and when we’re together, we’re fully present. I’m focused on growing my business, she’s independent, and there’s a really healthy balance. No drama… just genuinely a lot of love and a great time.\n",

      "But here’s the thing: she doesn’t want kids. She made that clear early on, but at the time, I didn’t take it too seriously.

So tonight my boyfriend (of two years) got really sad out of nowhere and after I asked some questions, he admitted that he doesn’t feel like we’re as connected as he wants us to be.

      "Title: Wife choosing hobbies over family\n",
      "Body text: My wife(36 woman) and I(37 male) started running 3 nights a week for like 15 minutes. We would run together so it was a fun, healthy hobby to do together. She then got real good and started running 30 minutes. She would leave me in the dust. I tried to keep up, but can only go for about 20 minutes because of my knee and back problems. Then she joined a running club and now she runs every night, an hour or more after work. She runs way faster then me, so it isn't really together. We work opposite schedules, so the only time we really get together is after one of us gets off work. She spends an hour to 2 of that running. She then runs \"long runs\" while I am at work, like 7 miles. We have a 3 yr old and a 10 year old that I take care of 4 days a week. I feel like she is kinda neglecting the kids because of this hobbie. I don't want to leave the kids to run every night, as I feel there is more important things we could be doing with them. Running gets super boring and I'd like to do more fun things as a family. Anytime I ask her to try to limit her runs, when we are together, to 30 minutes, she pretty much screams in my face about how I'm trying to control her. Brutal fights where I feel beat down and pathetic for asking for her attention. This happens in front of the kids. I try to explain that she has 2 kids and a husband that need her. She also crochets when she isn't running, so that takes up a lot of her time. She does that for an hour every night too. I'm so fed up and upset that she doesn't care about my emotions. We have been together for 18 years and I feel so alone in life. I am growing resentful and depressed. I am afraid it is going to hurt our children. What the heck do I do? \n",

      "Body text: I wouldn't know for sure if I should label my girlfriend (22F) as \"emotionally dependent,\" but I don’t have a better term, so I apologize. She’s a very jealous person, and her constant phrases like “I couldn’t live without you” have me genuinely worried. She’s gone through very difficult situations in her life, and I partly understand why she is the way she is.

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been together for a while (4 years), and we usually spend weekends together. He’s the go-to handyman in his family, so it’s common for them to ask him to do things on weekends. Normally, he tells them he’ll check with me first, then calls to see if we have any plans. I almost always say it’s fine unless we’ve got something already set. I do the same with him when things come up on my side (things just don’t come up as often).

      "2.\t⁠Since moving in together, it almost feels like the relationship has declined. We have a generally productive routine together but we feel disconnected. We both take care of her dog together and generally share the load on home duties and financial needs. We share some hobbies but not all.\n",
      "3.\t⁠We almost called it quits a few times in the past 8 months. We decided to start couples counselling and as of 3 months ago. It’s been going well for the most part and helping us to unpack some of our bigger issues. However I think we both still feel disconnected. Doing things together now almost feels strained and less enjoyable than it used to be. I’m hopeful things will improve.\n",
      "4.\t⁠There has been considerable emotional stress and strain in the relationship. Of both of us not having their needs met and a lot of heavy life transitions.\n",
      "5.\t⁠We’re both now at great spots in our lives in terms of financial freedom. Either of us could live on our own and be fine. You would think this would be a recipe for success.\n",
      "6.\t⁠We know each others families well, and generally are accepted by each others families.\n",
      "7.\t⁠I am a white man and she is a black Caribbean woman so there are definitely cultural differences.\n",
      "8.\t⁠I proposed to her 6 months ago to which she explained she didn’t feel we were ready. I respected her decision and here we are. We both come from divorced parents so marriage does not come lightly to us. \n",
      "9.\t⁠At age 31, I do feel a time pressure here. I’d like to have a family in the next 2-5 years and so I’m stressed about whether this relationship will work or not or if I’m wasting time.\n",
      "10.\t⁠I’m hopeful this rough patch with only bring us closer together. Alas, only time will tell.\n",
      "11. The sex life has been non existent for about 6 months now. I raise it as a concern and try to initiate but she continues to refrain saying she’s not feeling it. To me this is a big red flag. \n",

      "Title: My [26F] relationship with my boyfriend [26M] is not getting anywhere. It’s been 6 years. How do I move forward either with or without him?\n",
      "Body text: TDLR: I’ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years. I wrote a list of pros and cons but I’m just so scared of failing this relationship. I need advice on how to move forward or how to better encourage him to change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, longtime lurker. Just reaching out because I need advice. I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost 6 years now. We both work in the same field, which is demanding of our bodies, time, and effort. We met in college and started dating sophomore year. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re at the stage now where everyone asks us every five minutes when we are getting engaged. Since I’m the girl, I get asked often why he’s not committing and “where’s your ring?” etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I want it. I want the whole life with him. But I’m not ready for it. I’m trying to protect myself. I think I’m rambling, but here is a list: \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: He’s a good guy. He has strong values. We like similar things like working out, trying new foods, etc. He has a nice family. They seem to like me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "- Im significantly more outgoing than he is. I’m always trying to accomplish something. He could spend his entire life at home after work doing nothing and be satisfied with the way things are. I want to achieve. \n",
      "- He does not defend me against other people. I have 4 separate examples where 4 different people disrespected me, and he did not have my back. We talked about each instance and he acknowledged it and said it wouldn’t happen again, but it seems like each instance was like a completely new experience for him. Like, just have my back man. \n",
      "- He always farts on or around me. I know farting is natural and all, but he thinks it’s funny to just keep letting them out around me even though I have very clearly told him that it is not for me. \n",
      "- He has anger issues. He gets road rage easier than anyone else I know. It’s scary because it makes me feel like he will rage and then get us into a car accident. If he stubs his toe, he shouts really loud and swears a lot and it’s scary. \n",
      "- He doesn’t plan anything. We started dating in October, and even before then 6 years ago, I planned to get him a watch that he wanted for awhile. For my Christmas present, he got me some chocolate and forgot to buy the “main thing” (a bobble head), and placed the order on Christmas Eve. He’s never planned a date. Or anything. \n",
      "- He wants to get married but does LITERALLY NOTHING to get there?\n",
      "- He only does things when prompted. We get into an argument every 2 weeks because I’m just begging him to plan something. He plans a date that’s almost exactly the same as anything I’ve ever planned before, so really there’s no planning involved. So he doesn’t plan anything for our relationship. He doesn’t plan out the future for us either. He says that he only sees it with me, which I believe he does, but that’s because I’m a go-getter and he can sit back and have a good life. \n",
      "- I don’t trust him. His word means nothing to him and I tell him this often. He just becomes mute, nods, or says he understands why I don’t. He lies to me a lot. We were at a baseball game and he went to go grab a beer. I asked him to ask the bartender for a glass of water if it was free. He came back without water and I asked if they had it and he said no, they didn’t. I had a gut feeling, so I asked him if he even asked. He admitted that he didn’t. I know this is a small lie, but one of the big issues for us right now is that I can’t trust him. Another previous example was when he was in a class, and a girl who is really mean to me was actually sitting pretty much right next to him. I knew she was in his class. Every thing he said about the class, he just omitted that key detail. I finally figured it out and asked him, and he admitted to purposefully leaving her out of his class stories. \n",
      "- His older brother just got married at a really expensive resort overseas. I was so excited to go. His parents offered to pay for the room, so I only had to pay for the plane ticket (that was still $800 which to me is still a lot). I decided I didn’t want to go based on principal that I didn’t trust him, but I wanted to go so badly. We fought a lot and he said he really didn’t want to go alone. I ended up going and I had a great time, but I keep regretting going. \n",
      "- He’s inconsistent. We have an argument pretty much every 2 weeks where I tell him exactly what I need: more effort in planning for us, meetings each month to discuss US and our budget, time, plans, whatever. He does not ever follow through. \n",
      "- He has no goals. I have to push him so hard to branch out. He just says broad things like “yeah I want to go into project management” like what have you done to get there? What does that even mean to you? He has no hobbies. \n",
      "- He and I graduated from a pretty good college. I know he’s smart. But he spends all his free time brain rotting on instagram. \n",
      "- He doesn’t take care of me on his own. He only does that when I ask him to or when he knows he’s done something wrong. And then he makes these large declarations about how he doesn’t deserve me and how I’m so great, and it’s like ?? Why can’t you treat me that way though?\n",
      "- He gives me absolute BS all the time. He can’t critically think for himself even though his job requires it and he thinks he can. He likes to brute force his way through things. I tell him not to BS me. And he just continues to do so.\n",
      "- We’re in the same profession, but I do my best not to make it my life. I have a ton of other hobbies, but all he does is talk about his job. And from the sound of it (we get paid the exact same), he’s not very good at it. It’s male dominated, so I feel like he wants to be better, but I would not want to work with him based on his description of how he works. \n",
      "- I’ve asked him to go to therapy. Again, he’s not consistent. He just said he would talk to a pastor from home too which is fine, but I’m 100% sure that never happened. \n",
      "- He has really bad stomach problems, likely due to IBS, but he doesn’t do anything about it. We are in a job profession that requires us to be physically fit and he’s not unfit, but he eats unhealthy. He’s not consistent with a diet. He uses so many condiments on his food that (from his words, growing up as a fat kid) are crushing his cholesterol and making his stomach problems worse. But his stomach problems always seem to be exacerbated when we’re about to do something together that he doesn’t want to do but I do, like going to garage sales together. \n",
      "- He keeps claiming that our problems only arise because we have different love languages. his only love language is physical touch. Maybe words of affirmation. But I feel disgusted when he touches me and why would I affirm his actions if he’s always lying to me and being inconsistent? \n",
      "- He has a bad attitude all the time. And when I point it out, he says “no, I don’t!”. Like ok, what do I do with that? He’s a Debbie downer on everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, it’s almost been 6 years. I feel like I’ve suffered through heartbreak for 4/6 of these years. But I feel like I can’t leave because my whole family (and his) would be so disappointed/mad at me and also I would feel like such a failure. I take really good care of him. I’m always thinking about him, and us, and our future. I feel let down all the time. I don’t even know what I’m asking for, but I just need help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other details:\n",
      "- we live together with another roommate\n",
      "- I own the house and bought it a few years ago by myself. He pays me rent and has his own room \n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months now, but we’ve been essentially\n",
      "living together for a good portion of that so i’d say we’re a lot closer than most people at this timeframe. About a month ago, i talked to her about how I was uncomfortable with her conversations with one of her guy friends, since they always primarily revolved around sex. Things like how he wanted to hookup with her friends, talking about girls he had had sex with, and how horny he was. Even as far as sharing details like that he just shaved down there. I thought this was crossing a line, and she got a bit defensive about it saying that that’s just what they talked about, but did agree to talk to him to tone it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week ago, i discover that nothing changed, at all. We have a fight about it, and she basically said that she didn’t want to ‘start a thing’ by bringing it up to him again or shutting it down. She did agree with me that it was crossing a line and was disrespectful, she talked to him again, and that was that. Today, she had a dinner planned with him and her two best friends (girls). Before this, me and her had plans to hangout or go study or just do something together. Instead of this, she decides to take a nap in my room and sets an alarm, not to spend time with me, but to wake up for the dinner. When her alarm goes off, she doesn’t respond so I wake her up and tell her, she turns it off and goes back to sleep. I wake her up again after 20 minutes, and she seems visibly upset on the way there. She says that she’s a bit upset she’s late, but I can tell that’s not all of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why, when she’s feeling this upset about something and won’t talk to me, she instead wants to go have dinner with a guy who she knows i’m uncomfortable with and is an active point of argument in our relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t even want to bring up that this made me upset because I don’t want to start a fight, and i’m not sure if there’s a good way to talk about it without starting one.\n",

      "Body text: I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 5 years — we started dating in high school. I’ve stayed because I really loved him and kept hoping things would get better. But honestly, he’s never been caring, supportive, or thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I got a great internship that I worked really hard for. It starts in a week, and when I brought it up again, he said, “Doesn’t it start next month?” and didn’t even remember the name of the company. That was a big moment for me, and he treated it like it was nothing. It really hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just one example. He rarely shows any genuine interest in my life or emotions. When he’s in a good mood, he can be nice — but that version of him only shows up about 15–20% of the time. The rest of the time, I feel emotionally alone in the relationship.\n",

      "Title: Father doesn't financially support me, yet wants my time and attention\n",
      "Body text: I (20F) am going into my senior year of college next semester and haven't really talked to my father(M58) in about a year. Because last summer, I found out he gave my cat to the neighbors, who proceeded to neglect him, but it was really just the final nail in the coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wasn't around much when I was very young since he was in the military, but I at least looked forward to seeing him. We've been growing apart since he remarried when I was around 10 when we kind of just stopped doing things together, DnD was no longer fun if we even did it because my step mother(F38) went to bed earlier or was a sore player and he insisted on her playing, we never went to the creek anymore, lots of broken promises abut doing stuff together, he started making fun of me for how I walk, being a no it all (what kid doesn't like sharing fun facts they learned) sided with my step mother when she asked if the reason my nose had a bump was because it was broken and I got mad at her, even their roommate sided with me when he accused me of faking being sick (she worked in health care I forget as what), made fun of me for not shaving my legs, let his friends kid destroy my legos when I wasn't there, you get it, he wasn't there for me emotionally or physically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other finishing move, which I wonder if I'm wrong for, occurred last summer before the cat. My mother lost her job, and I asked him to pay for just my food, and asked for $200 a week. If that seems like a lot for a college student, I am 5'9\", do manual labour at work, where I volunteer, and on my off days, go to the gym. I am also trying to gain weight to join the military, as I am underweight. He said no. I was not eligible for food stamps where I live, as you need to work 20 hours a week, and I have a substantial amount of savings for medical school, $100,000. I was working off the books as a dog walker, on the books in the school greenhouse, and as a lice technician. I was also taking organic chem and two other easier classes, along with volunteering in hospice, errand services, the ER, and a cat cafe by my school over the summer. I am pre-med, and NEED to get good grades in my classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, at this point I thought back on if my father had financially supported me at all and realized he hadn't, my mother pays all my bills currently, and he didn't even like feeding me when I visited him and said we would have to discuss rent if I lived with him or in my grandmothers, empty house. He doesn't pay my tuition, but he did help me get a no-interest loan, cosigned my other loan with interest, and helped me get a scholarship. However, I consider the scholarship a wash since he took so long to get me his taxes, and I missed out on other scholarships. He makes $300,000 a year. We are in family therapy now, and he wants me to talk with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I am no longer speaking to my father for a variety of reasons; he wasn't there for me emotionally, physically, or financially. The final nail in the coffin was him saying no to feeding me and giving away my cat. How do I get him to financially support me? Or if not possible, leave me alone? \n",

      "However over the past 3 years, I think the stress of kids and also geo political issues which are hard to see in the news constantly have had a real effect on my wife. It's like the light in her life is gone. She'll openly admit that she sees the world differently and just isn't the same anymore. I find this really sad. The worst thing about it though is that I really feel she's taking it out on me. As I said before, i'm no angel- but i'm a good husband and a good dad, but I just feel like I can't do anything right.

The problem is I have been open from fairly early in our relationship about my insecurities about my physical appearance. Growing up a chubby kid in public school in Arkansas had its challenges.

      "TLDR: My partner (28F) and I (28M) have been together for eight years, lived together for seven years. I am having serious doubts about the relationship but am very avoidant and don't know how to bring this up with her. She seems content despite our ongoing issues and would be completely blindsided.\n",

      "I love my partner so much but have recently been having serious doubts about the future of our relationship, I feel so guilty for feeling this way and don't know what to do. Most of the things I'm feeling doubt over have been issues for a while but recently it feels like a switch has been flipped and I'm suddenly very aware of them all and worried:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We still get along but feel more like roommates than lovers. I have never been the most romantic person but lately it feels like we act more like roommates than partners in a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I have been chronically depressed for about three years, I have no real drive or ambition and feeling pretty checked out of life most of the time. I have been in treatment for my mental health but things aren't improving. I know that my low mood and lack of motivation bothers my partner (she has always been much more driven and ambitious than me, even before my mental health took a hit). \n",
      "\n",
      "3. When I think about the future I feel uncertain and anxious. Throughout my 20s I have been really unsure about whether I'd eventually want children. Now that im approaching 30 I still feel really uncertain (in part because I feel like my mental health struggles would make an unstable parent). I guess I assumed I wouod eventually find clarity on this but it hasn't happened yet. My partner is not in a rush to start a family soon, but I know that she is much more confident that this is something she wants, and I keep thinking that she deserves a partner definitely on the same page about that. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. We have had a dead bedroom for over a year. This is definitely my fault. I have always had a low libido and throughout our relationship we've probably on average had sex about once a month. Again, maybe due to depression but for the last year or so my sex drive has been completely non-existent. I know this is another thing which bothers my partner and makes her feel ugly and undesirable. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. I worry about my partner a lot in ways which feel unhealthy. I sometimes feel like I have an overly protective or patronizing attitude towards her. She has struggled a lot with her health both mental and physically over the years, her family are not great and did a lot traumatize her as she was growing up. She can be very anxious and gets overwhelmed easily. I have spent a lot of time over the years taking on the role of protector or caretaker for her when she has been struggling. I worry that this has led me to treat her like she can't take care of herself at all and I'm holding her back from growth by always jumping in to take care of things for her. When I think about the relationship ending I am very sad but also I get really anxious at the thought of her having to fend for herself. I know this is a really patronizing way to feel but I can't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess overall I am realizing that my relationship has a lot of flaws which have gone unaddressed for a long time. I think about the future and I feel really uncertain and worry that we've stayed together more due to inertia than anything else. I don't know how to even begin to bring any of this up with my partner. I don't want to break up with her but I worry that some of these issues may not be fixable.\n",

      "Body text: We are college students and have been in a relationship for about 14 months now. about 6 months ago, my girlfriend made a new friend and they grew pretty close decently fast. they used to hang out a lot together, and do multiple projects together etc etc. I figured out the dude had a crush on her, but i trusted my girl 100% i brought this up to her in the past twice or thrice, but more or less she sort of disregarded it usually and gave her own reasons for it which sort of made sense, but to me things were clear that the dude was down bad.\n",

      "Title: My Girlfriend (F/22) cant seem to forgive me (M/22) for abandonment.\n",
      "Body text: Hey all, Having some deep issues within my relationship with my girlfriend of over 3 years. Our relationship had begun spiraling down within the second-year mark. Both of us noticed a slight shift in how we interacted, with me pulling back instinctively because I felt a shift. We didn't end up talking about it; she didn't bring it up, and I didn't either. I have a tendency to avoid conflict and sweep things under the rug when it comes to conflicts in all my relationships. I get an internship opportunity in a different state on the opposite side of the country. I ended up saying I would bring her out to see me while I was out there, but I was strapped for cash due to being lied to about pay for the internship. I never fulfilled what I said I was going to do, and during those 3 months that I left, she felt abandoned. She specifically let me know that she felt like she never had my attention and that she's always trying to catch me. We never started having these conversations until I came back home after the summer. I've been able to get back into my regular routine with my job and school while keeping my word and have more time for things. Since then, she's let me know that she no longer feels like she has to hunt me down, and things are looking better. However, she says she still has not forgiven me and is not sure if she can forgive me for the abandonment she felt. Due to that, she herself has kind of stepped back, but she is open to solutions and seeking professional help. Booked a session to see a therapist via Zoom next week.\n",

Besides him being borderline delusional that every dude who looks at me is someone I've dated, which is irritating and ruins the mood. He'll always make jokes that feel more serious than a joke until I call it out about me having a side dude and he'll even have me screenshare my messages on everything and screen record it to read back on them and see everything I say, which I have just completely given up talking to most people besides him due to this breach of privacy. Yes, I've talked to him about it and he limits doing it now, but still does it. He's very insecure from his past relationships. To top it off, he almost constantly asks me to buy him food or lyfts. In which he barley reciprocates doing the same for me as he spends all of his money typically on silly stuff. Not to mention, I've been through bad stuff sexually in the past and sometimes due to being triggered, he will be salty if I say I'm not in the mood for sexual stuff. He'll typically guilt trip me saying I don't find him attractive anymore, etc. I don't even look forward to calls anymore because it feels like a booty call or him wanting me to spend money on him. I love him a lot, but I'm becoming unsure of that. He wants me to wait 2 years until we live together too. It feels like too long.\n",

      "The problem is my father always need a billion explanations whenever we turn down one of his invitations. 2 years ago my brother turned him down and was buried with questions asking why he didn't want to come.

      "A few days ago, I hit my head on the pavement after taking a fall. This is right in the middle of finals, whereas I am supposed to be graduating this semester. I finally decide to go to the doctor today because I have a headache and my vision is a little blurry. I go to the school doctor, which then tells me to go to the ER because symptoms are worrisome. The school doctor doesn’t let me leave the building without somebody coming to get me. Obviously, I call my boyfriend who lives with me, to come and get me. The only problem with that is that he was blacked out drunk so I had to call my other friend. This friend gets my boyfriend in his car and takes us to the hospital. All three of us are waiting in the waiting room and my boyfriend leaves. Apparently he went in the parking lot and threw up a bunch. I’m waiting to get a CT scan and cannot deal with him. After I get my CT scan done and everything he gets back inside my other friend at this point has to leave, leaving me alone with my boyfriend. While we’re waiting, he starts getting aggressive calling me a beach, saying that this is a waste of his time, and generally just being rude to me. At this point I’m frustrated because he’s asking me the same questions over and over and my headache is not going away. I tell him to leave if he’s going to do that, but he says “no frick you I’m not gonna do that.” We finally get discharged, and on the way back he’s asking me the same questions again. When we get out of the Uber, I walk across the street to our apartment, and he just stays there. He leaves to go drink with his fraternity friends. And now I’m here alone at home with a huge headache and a concussion. \n",
      "The thing about this is that things like this I have happened before. I hit my head because I was trying to pick him off of the floor after he was blacked out and he left the apartment. He’s called me weak when I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression because he doesn’t believe in it. I’m just starting to hate him. I don’t want to. But it’s hard when somebody treats you like this, especially if you love them, and especially when they say they love you. \n",
      "I’m just tired and my head hurts. I don’t know what to do. He’s just hurt me so much and it’s obvious he doesn’t care about me. I guess I can’t beg him to love me, but I do still love him. When he’s sober, he treats me like a queen but when he’s drunk, his behavior is inexcusable. \n",

She wants to visit from her country with her new boyfriend, before our baby comes and everyone can meet each other before we're busy with a newborn. Partner considers it the right and kind thing to do to host them. I feel uncomfortable with it and suggest staying at hotel. He says that's rude and unacceptable for them to do that and instead would visit them in their country if that's the case. Visiting them in their country would be unfair for me seeing as we had to cancel a trip because of money \n",

      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'm (47 F) and am dating a new person (57 M). I've been alcohol free for 2yrs after a painful and contentious separation from my kid's dad that I tried to escape with alcohol  (I never had a good relationship with alcohol to begin with). I started dating someone 4 months ago who's in the process of a divorce and has been separated for 2 years. He's great. In therapy, really mindful, caring etc.. We've spent all of our free time together since our first date. He knows I don't drink and hasn't really ever asked me about it, but I did offer that I have a family history of addiction and don't want to pass it on to my son and he didn't have a ton of questions about that. When we hang out he'll have 1-2 beers at dinner which is not a big deal for me. He seems to be able to stop which is something I couldn't do.   \n",

Since then I've talked to him at night a few times where it sounds like he's had too much to drink. \n",

      "Even though I don't think he is remotely where I was when I drank, it's a trigger for me and I worry about someone numbing or avoiding real issues in the beginning of a relationship. Not sure if I should keep observing or say something and if I say something how do I approach it. \n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "TL;DR - feel like my bf (25M) is becoming too immature for me (20F) due to his lack of healthy habits, frivolous spending, lack of ambition and energy to do anything. He is a nice guy and can be generous, but is this enough when I’m becoming frustrated by his actions overall?\n",
      "\n",
      "My 25M bf and I 20F have been together for 2 years. He works full time and I am a full time law student who works part time (25-30 hours a week) and interns 8 hours a week at a firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for about two years, and whilst I do care about him, a number of ongoing issues have been weighing heavily on me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are justified.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start with, I have asthma, and he vapes — even after I’ve shared how concerned I am, both for my own health and his. Early on I expressed my concerns and he really limited it, and would go outside instead of sitting with me and vaping constantly. However, he doesn’t seem to be understanding how much it affects me, even at one point earlier in the relationship, my boyfriend actually joined in with my friends, encouraging me to try it, despite knowing my health issues. That moment stuck with me and has made me question how seriously he takes my health in general ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hygiene and attitude towards health also really frustrate me. I’m someone who goes to the dentist every six months, brushes twice a day, and sees a doctor when needed. He avoids the doctor entirely because he can’t be bothered, doesn’t brush his teeth regularly (which grosses me out), and laughs off my concerns when I bring it up. Since being with him, I’ve had recurring yeast infections that have made me dread intimacy, but he just thinks I’m being dramatic or overly anxious about health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, the relationship feels very one-sided. He lives 20 minutes away, but we rarely actually do anything together unless I initiate it. I invite him to family dinners every week, which he attends, but he never invites me to his, and we don’t do much socially. When we went on holiday with my family last year, I hoped he’d at least help with cooking or cleaning as my parents said he didn’t have to pay his share for the cabin we booked— but he didn’t, instead opting to spend 30 minutes in the car vaping before dinner was ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I buy gifts for his parents, yet he’s never done the same for mine, and last Christmas he asked me to buy my parents gifts on his behalf because he \"always forgets.\" This really annoys me because I feel guilty that my parents always make sure to invite him out and cook for him, but he can’t simply make effort in buying them a gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a well-paid job but poor financial habits — buying new, more expensive cars every year because he gets bored, and not handling his own bills or responsibilities. He still lives at home (which is fine as I do too) but has been quite sheltered; his parents do everything for him (cooking, cleaning, appointments, food shop) so it’s clear he hasn’t developed much independence. Meanwhile, I’m balancing my own adult responsibilities, exams, work, and life. I’m five years younger than him, yet I constantly feel like I’m lecturing someone who should be more mature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, even the small things he does just irritate me. He used to make a lot of empty promises and I addressed this with him, saying we couldn’t continue this way, which he listened to, but it’s hard to ignore how imbalanced things feel now with all these other things piling up. I feel like I’m really starting to check out of this relationship the more I see these behaviours.\n",

      "Body text: I (22F) have been dating my 1st yr med student bf (23M) for like 7 months and I am graduating soon and applying to medical school. I know I am not nearly as smart as he is and didn’t score as high on my MCAT but I am still applying and he has been aware of that since we met: he has been aware that I am graduating, applying to med school and have dreams of being a primary care physician and none of that has changed since we’ve been dating no matter how much he tries to convince me to give up or become an NP. Now that I’m graduating this has become a serious point of contention: where am I gonna be next year? For my gap year I can either live in the same city as him where I have no friends and no family except my younger sister who will be in university. I will probably have to work a job that pays less and find a new apartment unless I live with him. Or I can live at home (5 hr away by car) with my parents, work a job that pays much more and be with my family.\n",

He is here for his md for 4 years so he doesn’t have to give up anything but I do. I hesitate to live with him during my application cycle because he is not supportive of my application. He thinks I am too optimistic of medicine, that I am applying too early with a poor MCAT and weak application and because I want to do primary care I should “just become a PA or an NP” and because I don’t want to do that I am “brainwashed.” \n",

      "Help! What should I do? Is there a way to compromise if he doesn’t want to do long distance?

He’s the only man who has ever treated me with respect and kindness. The problem is there is no more spark. It feels like I’m living with my best friend. To be completely honest I don’t find him attractive anymore and I’m left very unsatisfied in the bedroom. So much so that it’s become a routine thing I do just to get it over with and please him.

      "Body text: I (31M) really like this woman (27F) I've been dating for a little over two months - she's incredibly blunt and funny and creative and I always enjoy our time together, we share values on religion and politics and even future family plans, and I'm unbelievably attracted to her. When we first started dating, our first kiss or two was a little awkward and I think we both wrote it off due to nerves, and it felt like our kisses/makeout sessions in the dates that followed improved and we were really feeling each other. Around our fourth or fifth date, we had a great night out with drinks and dinner and a show and we ended up back at her place, and things progressed to the bedroom not too long afterwards. It had been around a year since the last time I slept with anyone, and while we tipsily fooled around I couldn't keep my erection because I was too in my head about performance anxiety and the spontaneity of the moment and not using protection, and we ended up cuddling for a long time before I went home.\n",

In the past two weeks or so, I've noticed that our kissing just hasn't included tongue (despite me trying to get it involved like it had been in the past), and she hasn't reciprocated as much like straddling me or putting her hands on my chest or around my neck; last week she nervously mentioned something she didn't like about how we were kissing and I took it to note and tried to address it, but it kind of killed the mood and I went home not too long afterwards. I haven't had complaints about kissing or anything else bedroom-related in the past, and it really seemed like we were both enjoying ourselves earlier on in the first month or so we were dating, so I'm struggling to figure out how or where things went wrong and how to fix it. I'm not so egotistical to discard the idea that maybe I'm still just rusty as far as making out or physical escalation, but outside of that one moment she hasn't made any adjustments on her end or mentioned anything that's bugging her as far as us connecting physically and I obviously can't address any issues that I don't know exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't been particularly outspoken about these issues or made many overt moves to escalate things physically because our first time in the bedroom she shared that she has a medical condition(s) that would make intimacy difficult and even potentially one-sided, and even though I'm a little sexually frustrated and would love to really explore that aspect of our relationship a lot more, I don't want to put additional pressure on her for that specifically for something that's basically outside of her control. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think there's anything really significantly off about our relationship outside of the physical aspects - we text all the time sharing little details about our daily lives, the creative projects she's working on, my hobbies and the food I'm cooking, and anime we're watching; our conversations in person are lively and don't really have many dull moments and we've continued having fun on dates. Even though she's said she's not really a \"romantic\" person and tends to operate more on logic than emotions, I think the feeling is pretty mutual from her end because even if things are far as our relationship are kind of in a holding pattern (from my perspective) we keep scheduling time for each other in her limited time off from work and we've both talked about how we're dating with the intention of finding our life partner and having kids and stuff. I really like her and think we could have a great future if we can move past this issue with physical intimacy/chemistry, and that's partially why I've been so patient about the situation. One thing that does concern me is when I first broached a kind of \"defining the relationship\" talk about a week after we attempted to have sex, she kind of freaked out that we \"barely knew each other\", and since then I decided to put a pin in that conversation until there's a little bit more clarity about where we stand with each other in terms of physical chemistry and not just the companionship/emotional compatibility aspects of seeing each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "I see her in a few days and if things are still \"off\" as far as us kissing or making out or any kind of physical escalation past that, I definitely plan on bringing it up because even though I hate confrontation and kind of dread the idea that things could be off for a reason I/we can't really address, I really want to figure out what's going on and how we can get back on track because I think there's a ton of potential in our relationship and I don't want to date anyone else in the near future because I think they'd pale in comparison to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S.: To head off any comments, I don't believe she's seeing anyone else because of her previously mentioned busy work schedule, and the fact that she said she wasn't seeing anyone else when I tried to bring up defining the relationship for that exact reason. If she is, I obviously wouldn't be thrilled and would honestly be a little gutted, but because we haven't talked about exclusivity or labels there wouldn't be anything morally wrong in my eyes about it so much as just emotionally painful for me.\n",

I’ve always been emotionally self-sufficient but bad at supporting other people through their emotions— especially when it comes to grief. Growing up, funerals were messy.

      "I (33F) have a friend, let’s call her Lisa (33F). I’ve known her since I was 15 years old, now in our 30s. Lisa is a specimen. She is sweet and always there to help, but there’s a lot to deal with. She’s pretty insecure and not super confident so she overcompensates with very annoying stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she lies. She lies about dumb stuff to make herself interesting. It can be from « having royal blood » to telling something that happened in the past that I know is not true, either because I was there or because people who where there told me what really happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, she is a « know-it-all ». She will argue about the most unimportant things, alllll the time. She’s confidently incorrect a bunch, and she doesn’t let it go. It’s especially frustrating when it’s about a subject you know more about and she won’t admit she’s wrong. She’s like that with everyone, even people she just met. I have introduced a LOT of people to her over the years, and I cannot count how many times my friends, acquaintances, family etc said they didn’t have a good impression of her because of that. \n",

      "\n",
      "On top of that, when I was younger, I had my « wild days ». Going out, dating, drinking, having fun. She was always kind on the sides, following us, a little shy. When our friends and I started to settle down, to go on with our lives, partners, careers, she kind of started a « rebellious » phase where she drinks a lot and does blow with her aunt. She keeps bragging about that, which I honestly think is kind of lame? I don’t mind her being a party girl, it’s really the bragging part that annoys me. It doesn’t impress me or whatever so I don’t know why she keeps bringing that up. \n",

      "\n",
      "Last part - she borrowed money from me last year and never gave it back, never mentioned it again. 150$ while I was on mat leave so not nothing. She also borrowed a pair of white shoes and gave them back messed up, never offered to compensate me in any way. It it was me, I would have offered to pay for them, or take her out to dinner in exchange. Little things like that, that adds up to the list of annoyances. \n",

The thing is, we have a bunch of mutual friends and next week, we’re invited to the same event. Knowing her, she will see that I’m pregnant (I haven’t tell her, oops), and I know that when she’ll be a little drunk, she will try to confront me or talk to me about how her feelings are hurt and blablabla. \n",

      "Where maybe I messed up is: I haven’t seen her since last summer, always finding an excuse hoping she would get the message and then I was truly busy with work, school, baby, life, so I never addressed the situation really. Now, I don’t know how to navigate that. I don’t want to hurt her, and I feel like saying « we’re just not at the same place anymore » is kind of cliché? \n",

      "So here’s the deal, I attended a friend’s baby shower (we’ll call her Sarah) and my other friend (we’ll call her Julia) seems to be mad at me about it. We’re all in our 30s. I was invited to the shower and Julia wasn’t, but she said she didn’t care that she wasn’t invited because she didn’t want to go anyways. I was there for Sarah when she went through a tough time a few years ago and we’ve stayed in touch so I assume that’s why I got an invite. I had a really nice time seeing people I hadn’t seen in a while. People that are mutual friends/acquaintances with Julia. I’ve been dealing with health issues for over a year and it’s honestly been horrible, so anytime I can get out to socialize and enjoy myself it’s a good thing for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Julia texted me bringing up someone at the shower and negatively commenting on their appearance (I assume she saw a photo someone posted). I told Julia that it was nice to see everyone at the shower, and that a couple of our mutual friends/acquaintances had said how much they miss Julia. That’s all I said and rather than being gracious and glad that I had a nice time she responded by saying repeatedly that all those people are fake. I changed the subject and really didn’t think much of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Until the next day when she sent me a text apologizing for being rude and saying she was just mad because all those people are fake and she’s known Sarah longer but wasn’t invited, but made sure to emphasize she does not care that she was invited. And came up with a bunch of other excuses for being mad (she was tired etc.) I was confused because I didn’t realize there was an issue or that this was a huge deal and I texted back saying oh I didn’t think you were being rude at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been thinking about it though and the whole thing just really rubbed me the wrong way. I had a nice time at a baby shower and somehow it became all about her and her feelings. When it’s quite literally an event that had absolutely nothing to do with her and was about celebrating Sarah. I think she’s actually just angry she wasn’t invited but doesn’t want to admit it. And somehow I’m guilty by association for attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more context Julia seems to have an issue anytime I hang out with other friends, to the point where I do not mention it when I have plans with other friends and almost never post on social media about it. Anytime I have plans with other friends it somehow becomes about how I hurt her feelings. Meanwhile she posts everything and anytime she’s with another friend she makes sure to post a selfie with them. Which is fine because I’m an adult and know that people are allowed to have other friends besides just me! But despite all this posting she then will complain to me that she has no friends. I think it’s because she’s insecure and wants to make sure everyone knows how many friends she has. That’s just not really my thing, I prefer to spend time with friends when I’m with them rather than worrying about posting pictures. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just don’t know why she has an issue anytime I hang out with other friends, when she has other friends as well. It also feels weird that I have to hide my plans with other friends because I don’t want her to get mad at me. It just really left a bad taste in my mouth that she somehow made me attending a baby shower about her and her feelings. I don’t even know why she would need to make me aware of those feelings, I’m not the one who didn’t invite her! \n",
      "\n",
      "I think she’s obviously just mad she wasn’t invited but I was. I think it’s kind of immature and petty, and I feel like her going on about the people being fake is just something she could have kept to herself instead of going on about it when all I said was I had a nice time. And now I’m mad but don’t want to just fire off an angry text without thinking. What do I say in the text to get my point across and stand up for myself without completely ruining the friendship?\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "\n",
      "Im feeling exhausted and a bit lost in my 4 year relationship with my girlfriend, and would appreciate advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some context: \n",
      "For the first three years of our relationship, she struggled with a severe eating disorder that nearly killed her. She was physically healthy in the first year but quickly declined and ended up in hospital for some months. In addition she suffers with a general anxiety disorder. This put our relationship under consideral pressure, with me considering leaving multiple times, but feeling too guilty or scared to actually leave. However, we stayed together and I helped her through her recovery. We now live together and do most normal things in a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have been steady for a little over a year, im starting to find things difficult again. It feels like she is very dependent on me, she wont push herself, or do any hobbies or try to make friends without strong encouragement from me. She doesnt have any friends at the moment, which makes me feel like im her sole supporter. Because she doesnt have interests or friends of her own, it feels like she is very strongly reliant on me to occupy her free time. She wants to do everything with me and when I tell her I need some free time she will find reasons to interrupt it. When I am spending time with her, im constantly having to reassure her anxieties, and to keep telling her I love her. She clings to me and this can make me feel claustrophobic.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dont really share any interests but we get on despite that. All she wants to do is talk about things she is anxious about or to talk about food, as the eating disorder is still pretty strong. She has gotten better with this with time, but I dont have much energy to talk as much anymore, we dont have deep conversations much at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the above points, im feeling smothered keep losing my patience with her, im short with her and it feels like I am distancing myself from her. I find that I cant deal with her constant anxiety and questions. I just feel exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have explained this to her before, and she tries really hard to make an effort to try and give me space but I never feel it is enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have started counselling due to loss in my immediate family, and she gets anxious when I ask for privacy when I speak to my therapist. She thinks that I am talking about her and it makes her anxiety worse.\n",

      "She is a lovely person and so thoughtful and kind, she tries so hard to make me happy and I love her for it. I really dont want to hurt her, but I dont feel like I have much else to give. \n",

      "My friends and family have shown concern and I pushed it down because I believed I was fine. I think that they are good with it now. \n",

      "Body text: My (27f) boyfriend (33m) of 6 years has within the last year developed very serious depression and more recently has started very heavy drinking habits. This culminated a few months ago with an involuntary stay in a psychiatric facility after a frightening withdrawal episode. After that, we moved states to a less stressful job for him and I thought everything would be okay from then on. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the depression and drinking has started up with a vengeance and he is drinking more than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "He will not move except to pace around nervously and go to buy more alcohol. He refuses to come into the living room or leave the house unless he is going to the liquor store. And believe me, he has plenty of reasons to be depressed- he never fully grieved the loss of his brother a few years ago and has undiagnosed PTSD from a deployment. He also has sustained multiple head injuries, which he doesn't care to go to the doctor for. The issue is that he absolutely refuses to seek out any treatment; rehab, counseling, therapy, psychiatry, nothing. Even my suggestions of having me drive him to appointments is like me talking to a brick wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship that he has been neglecting and I've been desperately trying to shield her from the reality, but the few times he manages to come to the dinner table he is visibly drunk and will start being a dickhead to both of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reading I've done on this subject suggests that unless the affected person is willing to take their treatment into their own hands, the relationship is almost certainly doomed. He doesn't even seem to fully understand that I won't put up with this for much longer. Every thing I say to him goes in one ear out the other. And then when I try to leave the room to work or to grieve quietly by myself, he follows me because he refuses to be alone while also not wanting help. He blames me for his drinking and depression (I have had issues myself, but I was always functional and was never that severe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Is my instinct right that this relationship is doomed? This is my worst nightmare come true, I have been with him for so long and he used to be so wonderful. But now I can't see a future in this relationship if he legitimately has no interest in bettering myself.\n",

      "Body text: A bit of context. I met my girlfriend while we were both backpackers in Australia about 5 years ago. I'm from Canada, she and her sister are from taiwan. We lived together in Australia for 4 years with the sister living with us off and on. A little over a year ago, our Australian visas were going to expire so we decided to move back to my hometown and her sister joined us. They were on the same sort of youth backpacker visa we both had in Australia, but they're only valid for one year. My gf got approved for a permanent visa, while her sister got a sketchy, slightly fraudulent visa that expires in 3 years. With this sketchy visa, she needs to work at the same grocery store in my hometown for the entire 3 years. \n",

She told me her parents didn't want to get her formally diagnosed, but teachers suspected it growing up. She also got spoiled a lot and her maturity got stunted. In the entire 5 year relationship, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with her sister despite efforts on my part. She only started saying hello to me when I complained to my gf. She's very entitled, not thanking me for cooking, or including her as the constant 3rd wheel in any activities I have with my gf. She doesnt even appreciate my GF subsidizing her. The only relationship she's ever had was with a married guy in Australia and continued it even after the guy's family arrived in Australia.\n",

My GF's sister says she will figure something out if we leave, but we both know for damn sure she can't afford a place to live on her own. She's holding on to hope she can get a permanent visa, but with her education and changes in the immigration system she doesn't have a hope. I just feel stuck. My GF is frustrated but won't leave her sister, and her sister won't make up her mind.

      "he has jealousy issues around other men in my life. before we met, i had a neighbor (40m) a few doors down that i would sleep with on occassion over a span of maybe 6 months. we never hung out, we didn't talk much, it was purely physical. i am not attracted to this man, and i honestly think he's kind of a joke of a person. we were both basically using each other for a night of brief sex (he rarely even ever spent the night).\n",

(this is not due to any truth or credence to my sexual history or character, he just believes that about any female, as i don't have the sordid sexual past that he assumes/believes i've had, no matter how many times i tell him). i know this is part of his emotional baggage, and we both admit it is something he is working on fixing for him/us.\n",

      "Body text: Some background:  \n",
      "My (31M) girlfriend (25F) and I have been together for about a year and a half. It's been one of the easiest relationships of my life — basically no stress, we get on really well, have the same interests, and she really makes an effort to find ways to connect with me. She even went as far as asking me to help her build a PC and desk so we could be together while I'm gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll highlight that I think I was reaching anyway — she’s kind, generous, good-looking, and really thoughtful. I thought we got on great and assumed we had the same plans in life: a couple of dogs, a house, marriage, and we were both very excited about our future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family doesn’t like me. They are polite and always very friendly to me, but I have heard that they kind of badmouth me behind my back, saying I’m not good enough for their daughter, etc. Her family is important to her, so I never made a big deal about it. When she gets upset about it, I tell her, \"No one likes everyone, and they are entitled to their opinion. At the end of the day, they’re simply looking out for their daughter, but what she does in life is up to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We were recently looking into getting a house together. Unfortunately, the sale of one she was set on fell through, and it left her very upset. I consoled her and did what I could to calm her, but it understandably left her stressed. She currently lives with me in my rented house about an hour from her family, and I know she wants to live closer (the place we looked at was much closer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, along with a slight change at work making her job harder, she’s been having panic attacks and, in her words, \"doubts\" and some anxiety.  \n",
      "I've always comforted her and told her I’m not mad if she wants to cry or vent to me about what's stressing her out in life, but she’s always been adamant that no matter her thoughts, her \"one constant is that she loves me and wants to be with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, today at work she had an anxiety attack and was again talking about doubts. I told her to take some time, maybe call her parents and talk with them — that talking would help — and that I’m always here if she wants to talk to me.  \n",
      "She did just that and came home today to say she wants to break up. She said she was unable to give a good reason — she loves me, she can’t stand the thought of losing me — but feels the doubts won't go away, and she’d hate to buy a house, have dogs or kids, and still have these lingering doubts.\n",

Recently, after a house purchase fell through and her job became more stressful, she's been experiencing anxiety and doubts.

      "Body text: Hello, I’m posting this on here to get some advice because I’m lost on what I should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been dating my gf for 5 months now and we’ve had a great relationship. We have had no issues apart from a reoccurring problem which is her behaviour while drunk. Whenever she would go out with her friends she would get too drunk and I’d have to carry her home. We don’t live together but when she drinks she insists she comes back to mine which I don’t mind because I can easily take care of her and don’t have to worry about if her friends can look after her and get her home safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "However the problem starts with her behaviour whilst drunk. Firstly, she can’t stand so I literally have to drag her to the bus and some times uber us home because I can’t make it to the nearest bus stop. Secondly, she becomes a bit physical when she’s drunk. For example she would hit me while I’m trying to drag her or hit me if I get annoyed at her behaviour. Although when she’s sober she would never do anything like that. Also she gets also a bit verbally abusive, calling me names and insults when I do things like tell her she can’t go back to the club or that she should limit her drinking. Lastly she constantly asks me if I’m cheating on her and says that “I’m probably messaging other girls”. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve always found it weird that she does this as I’d never cheat on her or given her a reason to suspect that I’m cheating. She never remembers what happened the next day and apologises for her behaviour when I mention it. I didn’t rly have an issue with it as I’ve looked online and it does seem like girls do get a bit emotional when they drink. The next day she tells me that she’ll do better next time but the same thing just happens again. \n",
      "\n",
      "However after what happened a few days ago I’m not sure what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was at a party and decided to come back to mine (drunk) afterwards. While together I got her some water to sober up and I got into bed to fall asleep because the time was around 2am but she insisted that we should have sex. When I said no because she was drunk, she tried to force herself on me but I was able to push her away. When I did this she hit me. After that I got angry at her and called her unbearable and a pain to deal with when drunk and she got upset that I said that and went to bed. The next day I spoke about what happened and she was very apologetic and she didn’t remember what happened. I suggested that we should take a break for a couple days just for her to reflect on what happened hoping that it would lead to a change in her behaviour. \n",
      "\n",
      "However the same day she went out drinking again with her friends. She had messaged me at the club and I pointed out how I don’t think her drinking again the very next day was a good idea and she just stated that “I don’t want her to have fun”. I just said that maybe we should take a longer break and haven’t spoke to her since \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure what to do as I love her so much and she’s completely different when she’s sober but i don’t know if I can handle her behaviour when she’s like that anymore and it doesn’t seem like she’s going to change. Any advice on what I should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; Gf acts very bad while drunk and doesn’t change her behaviour even though she said she will. \n",

Our honeymoon phase ended about 6 months ago and we've been learning how to speak through differences that we have. It's been really challenging and my biggest concerns have been the topics of cats, dancing, and children. \n",

When he first used to come over, my cat would be doing his thing: cuddling in bed at night and such. That made my boyfriend break out on a rash that was so itchy that he scratched until he bled. Now my cat isn't allowed on the bed, or even in the bedroom when he comes over. \n",

My boyfriend says that he feels angry and jealous at the idea of me dancing with anybody else other than him. But we've not danced with each other and he would only want to take private lessons (which I cannot afford right now). Since he can afford lessons, he did propose that we do 2 private lessons a month. However, this has not come to fruition for two reasons: both of our cars have needed major repairs, and I also think that dancing is an extremely low priority for him. It's been 3 months since the lessons were brought up the first time. I am now forcing myself to go out dancing alone this month regardless of how he feels because I felt depressed not dancing. My boyfriend has said that he will not impose his feelings of anger and jealously on me and I must do what is right for me, but he will not work on those feelings.

      "His stance on having children has changed. I am passionate about having a child in my future. I want to be a parent. When we started dating, he wanted children too. Now he says he will take responsibility for a child of he has too, but he is unsure because the right things need to be in place: financial stability; a stable home; and emotional stability. He's elaborated that he worries that I'm not emotionally stable (I have been actively working through my own childhood trauma and seen results). I believe working through trauma is a lifelong process, but that I'll make the strides necessary to heal before I have a child. However, this change in his stance has me concerned. \n",

      "I realize that everybody's boundaries regarding what they tolerate in their life versus where they draw the line and move on from a relationship is different. How can I address this? I keep wondering if I should break up with him. But we both are putting in a kind and concerted effort into the relationship and we have huge respect for each other, so I'm caught between wanting to have my cat near me, and having to imagine a life without him ever being in my bed again. Always having to tread gently around my passion for dancing around him. And wondering if he's going to embrace fatherhood, or just accept responsibility for it and not jump into it with me. Is it worthwhile to pursue a relationship with this man, who is worthwhile, at the risk of parts of myself not being able to express themselves fully and comfortably? \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I've been dating my boyfriend for a year, and while we respect and care deeply for each other, key differences are creating tension. He's highly allergic to my cat, which now isn't allowed in my bedroom. He feels angry and jealous about me dancing with others but isn't prioritizing dancing with me, which has affected my mental health. Most significantly, his views on having children have shifted from wanting them to being unsure and questioning my emotional readiness due to my trauma work. I'm feeling anxious and torn between honoring my passions and future goals or staying in a relationship where I'm unsure if my core desires will be met.\n",

      "Body text: I’m 25F and I’ve been engaged to my 25M fiancé for the past 6 months. We were in a relationship in our early 20s, broke up, and then got reconnected through our families a few years later. We decided to give it another chance and eventually got engaged. While there’s been an emotional connection, there’s also been a recurring imbalance in how we show up for each other.\n",

      "Over the past year, I’ve been managing fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and recently got diagnosed with depression.

That said, the emotional distance and avoidance were present even before his job loss.\n",

      "When I shared my depression diagnosis and said I’d appreciate him checking in around my doctor appointments, he said I was “acting like a kid.” I stepped back briefly to process things, and in that time, his parents called me to say they wanted to end the engagement. He didn’t contact me directly—not even to check on my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I later called him out on how emotionally unavailable he’d been, he lashed out, called me “stupid,” said I made everything about myself, and that I was emotionally too much. He also said he wanted a “soft and peaceful” partner and that I made him feel unsettled.\n",

It’s not that we don’t see each other often and that he’s jealous that I’m spending time with my friends instead of him but he says he can’t help but feel bad because he doesn’t have that connection with others.

He saved 1000s of bikini pictures or even normal pictures of hot girls. And what shocked me the most was the comments he made on those girls posts especially one influencer where he would commennt about marrying her, dating her, dreaming of banging her, loving her!!! There were so many comments like \"she always leaves me horny\" \"fine ass\" \"would you go on date with me\" \"comeeeonnmn letss get married\" \"bow to me\" \"damnn I need her\" \"I can't stop 🥵\" \"kya thighs hai yaar\" \"kya maal hai\" hot, pretty, beautiful, cutie, sexy and  what not!! And all this while being in a serious long term committed relationship with me! Even I never received so many compliments from him as much as I found on this account! He also used to never say love you to because he thought it was a special thing to say on special occasions only but here I found him commenting I love you on random girls pictures! \n",

He would make small gestures to keep me happy. Give me time and attention. He also said he wanted to marry me and that I am his bride. But recently very suddenly he brokeup with me saying he wants to explore, have casual relationships with women, hookup and post that phase we can maybe get back together to get married, or not - God's wish. Also, he was virgin before dating me but I was not. I was in a long term relationship before (3 years old) where I lost my virginity. But he always knew this since day 1 and still he begged me to date him. \n",

      "Body text: So we're dating for 1.5 months and every time we're away she's being negative constantly and i want to cheer her up but not only does it not affect at all she says that nobody will understand her and that she's better off alone and that people and everything is temporary. We've made quite an argument about this and when i say anything critical about her she returns it with how it made her feel instead of actually listening and trying to be emphatic about me. She's super self-centered and I'm literally yearning for her to understand me but when i mention this she says sorry for being toxic, negative, bad and stuff but doesn't wanna understand that venting isn't this this is just puking poison into the other person. I want to be there for her i can be her rock bottom when shit is rough but like she just doesn't wanna change her attitude about this and I don't know how to deal with it. I'm listening to her 7/24 and be there for her but the shit she's putting me through with her negativity is just really something else I'm not responsible for her own negativity but still cause I'm caring about her her negative outlet towards life affects me immensely as well. What should i do i already said to her to go see a therapist she said she already seeing one but can't go there cause of time/money problems. The therapist lives outside of the city and she insisted that she trusts only this therapist and no one else is also troubling.

      "Body text: I (26F) and my boyfriend(27M) have been together for the past two years. We’ve known each other since we were kids and even dated briefly in high school, but it didn’t work out back then. A few years ago, we reconnected and started dating again, and since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before him, I did go on dates but most of the guys I met were either disrespectful, only interested in sex, or emotionally unavailable. My boyfriend is genuinely the sweetest, most affectionate, and loyal person I’ve ever met. He’s supported me through tough times like when I was jobless or sick and I’m deeply grateful for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s a side to him that’s becoming harder and harder to handle. He has always been a bit jealous and possessive and I knew that when we got back together. But in the past few months, it’s gotten worse. He tries to control almost every aspect of my life from my social media activity to my job choices. He gets upset over small things and often becomes emotional or cries over trivial issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to forget, whenever he gets mad, he screams at me very loudly. This is extremely triggering for me because I grew up in an abusive household where my mom used to yell at me the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that maybe he’s afraid of losing me, but his behavior is becoming very frustrating. I'm not allowed to have male friends or even speak casually with male colleagues. He doesn’t talk to girls or follow any women on social media, so he expects me to be the same. But I’m a naturally social person, and meeting his demands is exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few days ago, we had a big fight because a male colleague added me on social media and I accepted the request. This turned into a huge argument and as always, he started crying and said he’ll never change, and that if I can’t deal with it, I should leave. In a fit of anger, I told him I wanted to end the relationship. We haven’t spoken since, but I know either he’ll come back or I’ll go to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, I love him so much. I can’t imagine my life without him. We’re currently in a long distance relationship and had even planned to get married in six months. The thought of leaving him or being with someone else breaks my heart. He’s the first and only person I’ve ever been intimate with. I don’t want to lose him but I also can’t keep living like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him all the time. When I get job offers that require me to move, he straight up tells me not to take them and gets mad. His need to control everything is suffocating me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And honestly, one of my biggest fears is that if I leave, I’ll never find someone who loves me this deeply again. He truly is devoted and loyal to me, and that makes it even harder to let go.\n",

Lately I’ve been so selfish and focused on fixing myself and changing things that don’t need changed. We openly discussed this. I’m aware of the problem I’ve caused and I want to fix it. During this period of selfishness I’ve stopped showing my love to her. I stopped kissing, never say I love you until it’s said to me first, never come up with date ideas, I just wasn’t there. But I love this woman so much, she has saved my life and loves me unconditionally. I can never see that look of sadness again when I said that I haven’t been loving her. She said she won’t leave though, because she has to enough love for the both of us. So fuck me and my endeavors, I need to live for this woman again. I need to uncover my love that I buried underneath everything. I know it’s still there, how do I dig it out? How do I re-wire my brain?

      "Title: I 22M found out that my gf 22F was still in contact with a weird online situationship\n",
      "Body text: So, I come from a family of cheaters unfortunately, never got instilled in me that perception of true love when growing up, especially when I found out my dad and mom were constantly cheating to each other - and found out that when I was 11. I'd say that left on me an intangible scar that would follow me to adulthood. So I'm 22 now, and I'm on an ongoing relationship with this girl, which I adore and treasure a lot. I sacrificed so much for her, and celebrated her birthday when I came back (I had to leave temporarily) - and this is mostly a me thing, but I don't have many girl friends that I speak, literally zero, my group of friends is mostly guys. And my girlfriend in that aspect is more open, she has a handful of guy friends, and I never impose to her some restrictions or limits to who she can talk to. Sure there was one time I saw a message that put me on edge back then, because I had no idea of the context nor what kind of friendship they hold - and that was none of my business during that time. She saw my reaction and tried to ease the situation which I deeply appreciate it, so all good back then. But still in me, i had unresolved feelings, so we met and had a chat just to explain my background and where I was coming from, I just wanted transparency on this, and apparently; a guy who she was talking to was an online situationship she had (before me) that lasted a month because the guy blocked her or ghost her, I don't remember the details anymore. And she was really sad and had panic attacks about it until I came, I don't know, made me feel like a rebound or placeholder for her emotions. I appreciate her showing the chat they were having but I don't know there was a message I didn’t like, and it was from her. The guy reconnected with her, and she scolded him because of how he treated her and then she had her closure with him, she asked if he still had feelings for her and he said no. Then the guy asked her if I should know about them which she replied no. When I saw that I was shaking, I don't know. Part of me saw it like a betrayal, because I sacrificed so much to get back, sacrificed time with my family, friends, money and my own time. I was completely devoted to her for 8 months. Part of me was trying to calm down, but the other part of me the paranoic of being cheated was edging more in my mind, seeing all this very very bad. And I know it's funny because they never met physically but still, emotionally speaking I don't know what is going on her mind. Speaking of that, there was this game she played with me called Xp maker, where you can create your own character, and now that I remember she created just 1 character for me and 2 for that guy. She did proceeded to block him, but only because I found out and was not having it all. She knows me all, she knows who I follow on ig and it's mostly sport pages, and that I only chat with guys. I don't know perhaps I'm over thinking because of my problematic family but I was not having it at all\n",

      "Body text: I (22M) recently (4 months) got into a relationship with a girl (23F) and I ran into some issues, in which I don't know if I'm the one who is at fault or if the relationship is toxic. I find my girlfriend a bit controlling and that's bothering me bit, she made me break off a friendship with a friend that I gamed with, because she thinks he hits on me, he is gay but I disagree with her about him hitting on me, regardless I trusted her judgement so no questions asked, I had to cut my hair a certain way to not look \"flamboyant\", I also disagree but did so anyway, I had to go to the gym less because I didn't give her enough attention while I was working out, I also disagree but conceded, maybe she's right, I do zone out when I work out. I have to play videogames less because I now have to work more to provide for her needs, she didn't like our old house and we had to move to higher rent, but I said all right because the house was indeed too small, she also said we needed to change our car, I didn't think necessary but my car was quite old, she was right about that. The last part is she talked to her ex on instagram and said I didn't trust her when I complained about it saying I had to break off my friendships but she keeps her ex around.

      "I (28M) am experiencing relationship issues with my partner (28F). We have been together for three years. I’m looking for advice and/or an objective opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were colleagues for several years first (minimal interaction - different departments). As mentioned above, we’ve now been in a relationship for three years - first year living separately and second & third year living together. We are not married or engaged. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning we had issues with her texting/interacting with several male colleagues who were clearly hitting on her. This stuff happens, no big deal. I was more upset with her reaction to it - i.e. not putting a stop to it. No cheating (that I’m aware of). This upset me because I’m fiercely loyal and refuse to maintain any inappropriate relationships with females that may upset my partner. My trust in her was impacted, but I’ve since forgiven her and we worked/moved past it. There have been no further instances of this that I’m aware of. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, our main issue has been this - I contribute heavily to the relationship and our future, yet feel as if her efforts and contributions are subpar. Let me be clear, she’s very pleasant to be around. Super chill, low maintenance, rarely gets upset or angry, and texts me frequently, etc. This is all great, and I appreciate these qualities; however, I feel as if relationships require work. To provide context:\n",
      "\n",
      "- I’d say I perform 70% of the household chores, to her 30%. \n",

      "- I have now booked and planned two seperate overseas holidays, with absolutely no assistance from her whatsoever. All she was required to do was transfer me half her share ($). \n",
      "\n",
      "- I have worked my ass off to purchase two investment properties in the last two years. This was done to secure/provide a better future for us. In terms of funding, I’d say I’ve contributed 60% to her 40%. That doesn’t matter to me though, the properties are both of ours and split equally. As I’m sure you’re aware, a lot of time, effort, and planning goes into a property purchase and ongoing management, etc. I have done this by myself with absolutely no assistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "- I’d say that I plan 90% of our dates/time together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both work full-time and often have conflicting work schedules, so we have very little time off together - usually only in the evenings for a couple of hours. It’s quite rare for us to have a full day off together. I noticed that during the small amount of time we did spend together, it would be spent on the lounge on our phones watching TV ‘together’. I was just as guilty of this and I initiated a chat about removing/being off our phones whilst spending time together. Whilst I maintained my end of the bargain, her phone usage began to creep back in - we had an argument about this and she later apologised, etc. and we moved on. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for our sex-life, it’s verging on being non-existent at this point. At the moment, we’d sleep together maybe once every three-four weeks. Whilst I understand some married couples go months - we’re still in our twenties, not married, and don’t have kids. I initiated a very polite and respectful sit-down chat about this. To simplify, I explained my needs and wants and she explained hers, which were practically nothing. We agreed once or twice a week was reasonable. However, it’s still every three-four weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months back we had a big argument, about her lack of effort (that’s usually the only thing we argue about). She had also been in a mood for several weeks by that point. Over the coming days it came out that she had been experiencing doubts about our relationship, wasn’t sure if she wanted to be with me anymore, and generally felt lost and confused about everything - work, friendships, relationships etc. After much probing from my end, she explained that there were parts of my personality that she no longer found attractive. She felt that my line of work had made me somewhat cold, unapproachable, cranky at times, and most importantly - lacking/rejecting affection. I acknowledged this and took responsibility for it. Without boring you with all the details, I put a huge amount of effort into myself and resolved all of these issues. To be fair, I can’t blame work for all of these issues, a lot of them were probably due to pent up resentment I had towards my partner because of her past behaviour and lack of effort. We had a respectful chat about this and moved forward. However, whilst I’m now on my best behaviour, deep down I’m becoming more frustrated. The reason being, not only am I working just as hard/contributing to the relationship as I was before, I’ve also addressed all of her concerns and worked on myself, yet her effort has not improved. \n",
      "\n",
      "During and shortly after our chat - the one in which she voiced that she was having doubts - she explained that she had been feeling depressed. I empathised with her and explained that all she does is work and study. I’m quite an introvert and enjoy time to myself, only catching up with mates once or twice a week (because I’m lucky enough to work with people I love everyday at work). My concerns were that she had adapted to my introverted lifestyle, which isn’t suited to her, so no wonder she was a little depressed and isolated. For years I had been encouraging her to play sport and catch-up with her friends/family more, etc. During out chat, I told her that I would pay for her to see a psychologist, which she has - two or three times so far. I also told her to see her friends and family more, which she has - she’s already been on a couple of weekends away with her girlfriends and organised a couple of holidays with them coming up. I gave her spending money for this so she can enjoy her time away. I also practically forced her into returning to netball, paid for registration, and bought her netball shoes. Would you believe it - she now loves playing netball again. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is great; however, I still feel as if she isn’t contributing to our relationship enough. We have had so many chats where I have clearly and politely explained my needs and wants. She previously mentioned that she lacked effort in the past because she was having doubts, but is now 100% committed. This is how every argument ends - she apologises, takes responsibility, say’s what she will do to improve, and says she’s committed. But, over the coming weeks I experience no change in behaviour or effort. I’m still doing most of the housework, book all the holidays, manage our properties, organise dates/time together, etc. Another ongoing issue, which we’ve spoken about, is how I feel incredibly unappreciated and unrecognised. There has never been any appreciation, genuine thanks, or recognition from her for all the effort I have put in, and continue to put into, our relationship and future, including holidays, housing, finances, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had another chat about our sex-life, during which time she once again explained that it’s not me, that she simply doesn’t have a sex drive or any sexual fantasies. For context, it’s still only every three-four weeks. Sometimes she’ll initiate, but it feels forced to me. We had a discussion about her coming off the pill and she’s going to the GP to discuss other contraceptive options - I offered, but she doesn’t want me to come. She’s still open to discussing it with me though. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, our sex-life was much better. It was once or twice a week and she’d frequently send me photos/texts, but now it’s nothing. I always had a slightly higher sex-drive, nothing crazy, but hers has seemed to have vanished. We’re both in great shape and really take care of our health and appearance. \n",

      "To be honest, it feels as if I’m in a parent-child relationship, or a relationship of a couple that have been married for twenty years. I’m tired of having to take the lead in everything. I’ve suggested seeing a couples-therapist, and she’s open to it, but it won’t get done unless I do it. She tells me that I over analyse everything and need to chill. It can be hard to get a grasp on what’s reasonable and what isn’t - I haven’t spoken with anyone about this and embarrassingly have only used the super agreeable ChatGPT. Apologies for the lengthy post, I tried to keep it as short as possible, believe it or not. \n",

      "\n",
      "We moved in together 3 months ago, after doing long distance throughout college. About 2 years ago, he started dealing with extreme anxiety. I encouraged him to see a therapist (I also deal with awful anxiety and therapy has helped me tremendously) and I expressed to him how much it can help. One of the first instances of an anxiety attack occurred when I was with him. He fell to the floor and was screaming, he scared me and I didn’t know what to do and broke down crying. I’ve never seen him like that and didn’t know how to help. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he is feeling anxious, he says he feels like he needs to “get out” and will go and drive aimlessly. I used to go with him because I feared his safety but he drives recklessly and speeds, even when I am screaming out and begging for him to stop and pull over. The last time this happened he grabbed my finger so tightly that it bruised. I told him he was making me feel very unsafe and that I was scared of him in that moment. He was very apologetic and does not let me ride with him on his drives now (and I don’t let myself go either). \n",
      "\n",
      "He would struggle with anxiety every once in a while (like a bad day once or twice every other week) but recently it’s been very consistent and he is constantly struggling. I told him I need him to go get help and I cannot see him struggle like this so often. He agrees but then doesn’t reach out to anyone, even after I told him i’d help him find a therapist and help with all of the paperwork if needed, drive him to the appointment, etc. He doesn’t act on it and then will have a period of time where he feels stable and then will say “I think I’m fine”. But then it’s just a matter of time until he has an anxiety spell again and the cycle repeats. I get frustrated with him. I can only deal with so much when he is not reaching out for help and seems to just wallow in his feelings. \n",

      "Body text: Okay so the backstory here is that we are both college students who work at the same summer camp. We started dating early last summer (9+ months ago) and everything was great. During the school year we go to colleges in different parts of the country which means long distance for those times. Despite this, the first semester was great! We had very good communication (calling 4-5 times a week, sometimes for 10 mins, sometimes 3 hours), but nothing suffocating and both support each other's ventures. We have also flown to see each other throughout school to shorten the time apart in addition to winter and spring break when we were at home and close distance. \n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, starting second semester and ramping up to now, she has begun to communicate less and less when we are apart. I will usually tell her times in the day I am free and suggest calling 3-4 times per week, and she routinely responds that she has a lot going on, or answers calls but seems disinterested. She claims that she is independent which is something that I know and love about her, but it has gotten to the point where she only wants to call maybe once or twice a week and the disinterested demeanor on these calls often leaves me feeling down. Despite this, she texts me and sends reels normally and our time together in person is relatively normal (except when she feels bad about the problems discussed in the rest of the text), and she both shows and insists that she loves me very dearly and has no interest in breaking up. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our conversations she has expressed having more mental health struggles recently, and to her credit, has begun therapy for this reason. The other day she told me about a conversation with her therapist about me, where she and her therapist agreed that she has a tendency to push away even if partners are not acting codependent. She expressed that she knows this is true and is regretful that I have to experience the effects. She also said that this is something she wants to work on because she wants our relationship to work for both of us. We talked about this and agreed that we should try a setup where she initiates calls so that we can talk when she is feeling up to it, since I am almost always engaged regardless of when we call. \n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this was a good solution, but since the day that we agreed on this (8 days ago), she has only initiated one call which lasted 7 minutes. \n",

      "I don't want to break up either, and starting in a few weeks we will be short distance for the whole summer so maybe things will change, but over these past 8 days I have been feeling very lonely. I understand her feelings are real, and unrelated to me but I need a bit more from her to make it through this until she can feel normal again.

We have never had any emotional intimacy and I cannot get myself to be physically intimate with him either. We want to separate but we can't till we have our green card process completed as well as the medical needs of our child are extensive enough that single parenting will impact that. This will settle down in near future but at the moment it's taking our complete involvement. \n",

To her, not having sex meant feeling undesirable and unwanted.\n",

We like holding hands, kissing, and hugging although at times she cringes from getting an ick? On one hand, I feel like circumstances like having a busy day, opting for a different fun activity, or just being tired at the end of the day were contributors. I consider myself decently attractive - I have dated around before this relationship. I have gone to the gym everyday for years. She told me what bothers her might be my style including hair and clothing. However, I feel that I put a lot of time into fixing my hair and received compliments growing up. Clothing-wise, I enjoy wearing gym clothing and relaxed fit. Why? Because at professional setting for work, I have to wear business casual, white coat, or whatever. She tried to change me, to consider certain barbers by sending some barber haircut videos. Men influencers who try on trendy clothes. I was told that I am attractive even in those gym and relaxed clothings by others. She argues that she doesn't see me in work clothes most times on the other hand.\n",

I guess I still found her to be perfect in her own way and thought this is just a part of growing old together. It was about being understanding that only sex is not what defines the relationship but other small things in it. Other than this sex thing, I've been fairly happy in the relationship. This is my longest relationship while it is the first serious relationship for her. Perhaps I thought she is her whole self with raw emotions and feelings with honesty as she tells me things like \"I don't find you sexually attractive.\" I still feel butterflies when I see her.

But my boyfriend says that he thinks it’s starting to affect me and I don’t agree. I’ve talked to friends and my siblings about this and they don’t think I do either. One of my siblings (29F) I’ve spoken to is sober and I tell her everything, so she would be the first person to tell me if I had a drinking problem. \n",
      "Every time we speak about this (which is often) I feel like he doesn’t listen to me when I disagree with him and it makes me feel so bad about myself. I’m already very stressed out with exams coming up and these conversations make it worse. I really struggle with academic anxiety so being able to spend time with my friends is like an escape for me. He’s admitted before that he can be too critical, but I don’t know how to get him to stop talking about it all the time. Some other things he mentions is that I skip class too much and that I’m too messy. How do I tell him that him criticizing me so much is making me feel bad?\n",

      "Title: Best friend always drops me for her partner\n",
      "Body text: A. was my best friend from 2010 to 2023. Every day, she came to my house (couldn't go to hers because of her family). We did EVERYTHING together. We told each other everything. We were like siblings. The only exception was when she was in a relationship. Then, she would disappear. She would replace me with her partner, and the only time she would reach out to me was when they had an argument or when she got dumped. This could go on for months without me hearing from her at all. I’ll admit, I only realized this pattern in recent years. I should add that I always took her back without hesitation, no questions asked. I was always happy whenever she came back into my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had always been single until 2021-2022. When she was single, and I had a relationship for the first time, she becamevery toxic and hostile. I still saw her twice a week during that period, but when I couldn’t meet a third day because I had plans with another friend OR partner, she would get angry and manipulate me. She’d make me feel guilty, as if I was neglecting her. To be fair, I think meeting twice a week is still a lot for best friends when in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she’s been in a stable relationship for two years, and it feels like she doesn’t even know me. She can’t make plans with me because \"she’s bad at planning.\" When I ask her to hang out, I hear she has something planned with her partner. She would only be available last minute when her partner is busy. And when I tried to make plans, it was always, \"It can only be between this time and this time, because before and after, I’m with my partner.\" Eventually, the schedule would be rearranged five times, all to accommodate her partner. I’ve also noticed that she doesn't share anything with me, but shares everything with him. It’s like I don’t even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This whole situation has hurt me. I feel discarded, replaced, like all those years of friendship we shared don't matter. I've tried to talk to her about it, but when I express how I feel, she always blames external factors—work stress, financial problems, etc. To me, that feels like an excuse. It’s obvious her priorities have shifted, She can’t seem to divide her attention between people. She either gives everything to her partner or to her best friend, and now it’s all about him. I miss her so much, but I don’t think of her as a friend anymore. I grieve the friendship we once had. It feels like she’s completely adapting to her partner and losing her own identity in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment of anger, I told her that I didn’t want to see her anymore. She responded in a sweet way, but her excuses still don’t sit right with me, and I just didn’t respond. So now, I’m left wondering: *What should I do? I honestly don't think this will ever change, and I don't want to be a \"half friend\" only when her partner is unavailable.*\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr My best friend for over a decade now only gives attention to her partner and doesn’t have time for me. I'm left wondering what to do, as I don’t want to be a “half friend” when her partner’s not available.\n",

      "Body text: I (22F) have been in an on-and-off relationship with a guy (23M) since October 2023. We’re not officially together, so I call him my “lover.” We took a two-month break and started seeing each other again in October 2024. I told him I’d need time before considering an official relationship to ensure we’re in a good place, so his not asking me to be his girlfriend hasn’t been an issue.\n",

      "Our main problem is communication, especially over text. In the past month, he’s been taking days to respond to simple messages and often ignores my questions or statements, shifting to unrelated topics. This wasn’t always the case—things were better before. We’ve discussed this multiple times, and while he seems to understand and briefly improves, he reverts to the same pattern within a week. Three weeks ago, I brought it up again and he listened and took action, but looking back, his responses feel like he’s just trying to appease me. He struggles to express his emotions and often needs prompting to share how he feels.\n",

      "I make time to check in on him because I love him, and he says he loves me too, but his actions—outside of when we’re together in person—don’t reflect that.

One of my friends has a partner with multiple businesses, yet she never feels excluded or like he is too busy for her.

      "\n",
      "I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for around 2 years now. Just after the 1 year mark (mid year 2024) we moved in together. It was hard to adjust to but we really wanted this so we tried really hard to make it work. It was really hard and some weeks we fought every day and nearly called it quits multiple times. I felt very sad and very lonely. At the worst of it he decided we needed to break up (end of 2024) we decided we wouldn’t end the lease and just stay until it was finished. we had different rooms and our scheduled didn’t align so we didn’t really see each other that much. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time I was obviously devastated and depressed and extremely lonely. He treated me like he didn’t know me and like I was trash when we were out in public or with friends but at home he would try to be nice and friendly with me. It really messed with my head ALOT. I was so up and down not knowing what was going on. He started going out a lot and I felt even more lonely because he didn’t invite me to anything or want me around his friends really, I also tried to make plans with him but he was always “busy”. It was heartbreaking to feel rejected like that. Eventually I started going out with my friends more and having fun and I felt so alive again. Obviously I yearned for that comfortability and safeness that he gave me but I was having fun. I started talking to someone I used to talk to again and a guy I had randomly met had started talking to me. It was all going fine until one nice he came across the messages and was really really upset. In my head I believed he shouldn’t have been upset because he broke up with me but he felt as though it was wrong and I was leading him on? We had a big fight and I messaged those two guys saying sorry I can’t do this I’m just not in the right headspace at the moment which they both understood and respected. I tried really hard to win my ex boyfriend back over so he didn’t hate me. After a while of just putting my feelings last and just prioritising stability between us he finally stopped hating me. He felt that we were better and asked me if we could give things another go which I agreed to because I felt that we were better and I felt loved and appreciated. I felt that we could make things work and I felt safe and comfortable with him. But I’ve been thinking about some of the people I talked to and how free I felt therefore questioning if we should take a break or breakup or do I just stay with him and just keep having these thoughts forever? But I’m also worried that the grass isn’t green on the other side and that I’m going to loose such a lovely person in my life who I love dearly. My family also loves him and he is so lovely to my friends and is just a great guy. Because I know if we end he probably wouldn’t want to be friends with me again. \n",

I don’t know what to do. I’m dying to go on holidays or move to another country and meet new people but I just can’t afford it. And I feel like I’m missing out on being in my 20s I feel like I need to do silly things and meet new people have flings etc. I feel like I don’t even know who I am at all and the days are just flying past me. \n",

You’re craving freedom, self-discovery, and new experiences, but you’re scared of losing someone you still love. You’re feeling stuck between comfort and growth.\n",

      "For example, I view our current financial situation as something many young adults go through—we’re learning and figuring things out. I try to give us grace.

I’ve been through some really traumatic things—like being stalked at a previous job and getting no help from HR or the police. That led to losing my job and racking up credit card debt while I tried to stay afloat. Eventually, I worked 60-hour weeks at Amazon to pay off that debt. I did it—but now I’m completely burnt out.

      "I want us to grow together, but our priorities don’t align. At the beginning of the month, he swapped a work shift to drive an hour to a friend’s birthday party (it was BYOB, so he budgeted for that), and I just assumed he had already paid rent. I didn’t even want to ask. Then on the 9th, he tells me he doesn’t really have money for rent and might need help. I haven’t told him about my savings because I’m afraid he’ll think, “Oh, she’s got it.” I wanted to share it with him out of pride, not obligation.\n",

      "He also got a kitten early on in our relationship—even though I didn’t think it was a good idea financially, especially since we were discussing moving in together to save money.

      "Then there’s how he treats the things I give him. Over the course of our relationship, I’ve given him thoughtful gifts for birthdays and holidays. Our first Christmas together, I got him a PS5 and a full setup—headset, extra controller, a gaming chair, everything. He let his little brother play with the headset, and it got broken. The PS5 is all scuffed now. I gave him an expensive extended storage device I used to use, and he treats it like it’s disposable.\n",

      "But now? He just tosses it on the floor, lets the cat lay on it, and even dropped it on the floor at work without caring. It drives me crazy to watch how carelessly he treats things I’ve worked so hard to give him. And when I ask him to take better care of them, he gets annoyed—like I’m nagging or being overdramatic.

      "Body text: I need opinions about my dilemma. Me and my girlfriend love playing games as a hobby together, but honestly it's her more. And last year she found this open world game where you can fight people which you can also have chat or voice on. I knew my girlfriend has anger issues before (it's the way she grew up with) and seeing her play that game just makes it worse (game's really filled with toxic people). So I talked to her about it, making her realize her actions and she eventually stopped playing the game. But here's the thing, she really loved that game and been dropping hints to me that she wanted to go back and play. Part of me wanted to say no but at the same time, I don't want to be controlling because I just want what's best for her, especially her mental health. So now, I told her that you can play it again, but I did express how much I hate seeing her out of the mood just because of a petty argument in a game (she once have projected that anger towards me after playing the game). She said she'll prove it to me that she has changed but I don't know. I'm just hurt because I feel like she's not considering my concern here but again at the same time I don't want to force her out from playing because it feels like I'm taking a part out from her. Can anyone help me? Thank you. \n",
