I.e, we can pass our actual existing reddit posts' data into an LLM to give it some ideas and show it some inspiration, and use that to get it to generate more reddit stories that are likely to be viral within a specific chosen niche of our choice.\n",
    "    - Additionally, instead of just passing good known stories into a general-purpose LLM (like Gemini or GPT-based LLMs) like we are right now, we could train or fine-tune a domain-specific LLM that is dedicated for this task (generating reddit posts within a specific niche that are likely to go viral).\n",

    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

         "My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n\nThey started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n\nThey are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.\n\nTL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.",

         "TLDR: My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer care for him. I’m scared because I don’t think I can\n\nI 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.\n\nFor context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.\n\nMy bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.\n\n\nThere’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.\n\n\n",

         "I (39M) have been with my GF (35F) for about 5 years. I love her. The idea of breaking her heart kills me. We live together, have animals together, and have discussed buying a house. She pushes more and more for a ring. The issue is, every time these \"forever\" events get discussed, my mind goes to all the things she does that drive me insane or make me insecure about the relationship.\n\nFor instance, I am very extroverted. I need to be social and hang out with friends or I get very withdrawn and short with people. However, she does not want to go out and do those things regularly. She needs a week to get enough social energy for a few hours out. The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.\n\nI NEED this social stimulation and I understand that she NEEDS to not feel pressured to be social. She has suggested on occasion joining me at some of my events but she wants to get there at the start time and leave either before or as soon as things wrap up because her battery is spent. That cuts into the social aspect for me because its the socialization before and after that really make the events enjoyable.\n\nI cannot imagine starting over again without her, but I also cannot picture a future where I am stuck at home for fear of being nagged about going out again.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My GF is an introvert and I am an extrovert. She wants me at home with her and I want to go out and be social. There does not seem to be a happy medium.",

         "For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself?

         "I’m 30 now, but when I was in my 20’s I was diagnosed with hormone-positive breast cancer. It was an incredibly tough experience, and I went through chemotherapy, surgery, and now I’m on long-term hormone therapy that’s put me into medically induced menopause. \n\nI’ve been with my fiancé for 10 years, and for most of that time, the relationship has been abusive. It’s taken me a long time to even admit that to myself. I know deep down I need to leave. But I’m terrified.\n\nCancer and the treatment have changed my body and my life in ways I never expected. One of the hardest parts is that my vagina doesn’t work the way it used to.  (I can’t go on hormones to help with my issues) I have no libido, painful dryness, and sex has been impossible for years. I’m sure some of this is emotional, being in a relationship where I feel unsafe and unloved,but the menopause meds make it worse.\n\nI’m afraid that if I leave him, no one will ever want me. I’m scared I’ll be alone forever. I don’t feel desirable. I don’t feel whole. The idea of dating again,of having to explain all of this to someone, is overwhelming. Who would want to be with someone who’s been through all this and whose body is still dealing with the aftermath?\nI think I’m also terrified to leave in case god forbid I have a cancer reoccurrence. \n\nBut at the same time… I know I can’t stay in a relationship that’s slowly killing my spirit.\n\nIf anyone out there has been through something similar,leaving an abusive relationship, dating after cancer, dealing with menopause, I would be so grateful to hear your story. I just need to know it’s possible to start over. That there are people out there who will love me as I am.\n\nTL;DR: I’m 30, had breast cancer in my 20s, and I’m in a long-term abusive relationship. Treatment put me into menopause, and I’ve had sexual health issues for years. I’m terrified to leave because I feel like no one will want me — but I know I can’t stay.",

         "I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n\nTo add more insight, I had schedule this trip at a specific time frame that worked best for her and her friends. This time frame pretty inconvenient for me since I go back to work the following day I come back from the trip. I've had to plan dates around her friends schedule since I met her. Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people. I am at a point where I am constantly thinking about ending things but worried this is trivial or non-issue thing to complain about. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore.\n\ntl;dr: Is it worth continuing a relationship if you aren't the priority? I personally couldn't marry someone doing this to me. Or do I try other forms of communication to salvage it?",

However, I have serious reservations which is putting me off the idea. \n\nHer Dad is obbessed with conspiracy theories, Anti Medicine, screams, shouts and swears when confronted. He never calls her unless she calls him; he never visits her, only her visiting him even though he lives doors away. He has threatened every member of family. He does not take responsibility for anything that has happened in his life and goes crazy if challenged on any of his views. Blaming his aggression as out of his control, followed by a sob story and crying.\n\nHer Mum treats her like a child, she is very immature and loves family drama and gossip. \n\nHer mum and dad are not together but still obsessively stay in touch. They point score and can often be insufferable, the roles are reversed. Dad living with sister due to dad not being able manage his finances as wastes all money on Cigerettes and Cannabis. Mum is every emotional and demands children's attention. \n\nMy GF is submissive to them both, can never challenge their views, so let's dad fall deeper in to his views and his behaviour is widely accepted within the family. Same cycle of dad being abusive, apologies, crys they all hug him.\n\nI cannot bring a child in to this environment. I need her to prove to me that she can stand up to them and do what's best for her and our future child. Right now I don't believe she can. \n\nIs this too much for to ask of her? \n\nAny tips on what she can do? \n\nShe is planning a 30th girls night out, even this she felt compelled to invite her dad to avoid upsetting him. Whenever I try to talk to her about standing up she runs away in to another room\n\nAnother example of something really wrong is that last year her nan passed away, her dad during his daughters grieving keeps saying she was murdered by the NHS and trying show weird autopsy videos. When she asked him stop he kicked off.\n\nPlease help\n\nTL;DR Dad & Parents controlling, GF is scared confrontation. Putting me off children. Need advice.",

         "Middle aged divorced woman with ADHD dating middle aged man with ADHD who has two young adult sons with ADHD. Whew! We've been together almost 4 years. \n\nI love learning about ADHD, find lots of value in getting ideas from others, discussing, etc. My partner was diagnosed with ADHD and takes medication, but is very triggered by the topic in a way that I'm not completely clear on. He does not like it when I bring up the topic.\n\nHe is living in another house that I own (not living with me) with his 2 young adult sons. I am trying to sell the house. I realize this is an imposition on them and we've all discussed it a lot. I always give them 24 hours if someone wants to look at the house. My ask is that it is clean and in order, but not that it look spotless. My partner has struggled big time with his boys around cleanliness in general (regardless of me). He doesn't know how to set and/or hold boundaries with them around this. He had said that he thought the house being on the market would help him to hold them more accountable for keeping the house clean.\n\nI now have an offer for the house. The realtor said that one of the reasons why I should take the offer (even though it is low) because the house isn't showing well. The feedback I've now received from both him and someone who cleaned the house professionally are \"unkempt\", \"filthy\", \"disrespected\"...and the litter box has been described as not being taken care of. My partner, his kids, and I have already had one hard conversation about this. I am messy. I'm often a hot mess! But my place is mostly clean. My partner says that he checks the house before it is shown and that it is relatively clean. I guess i'm just not sure what's happening. Hearing about this feedback and seeing how dirty it was the day it was photographed, makes me feel uncared about. \n\nAny insight would be appreciated. What should I do? He is sweet and values helping me and his family. He helps me out all the time with different things, he helps his mom, he helps his uncle, he helps his kids, he actually spends most of his time helping other people. He’s sounding like a complete jerk, but he is someone who is very well liked. \n\n\n\nTLDR My partner and his kids have different standards of cleanliness from me. It's impacting the sale of my house as well as our relationship. What do I do? \n\nHe is paying rent. I could be charging someone else more, but I'm not giving him some amazing deal. I will not be living with his sons. If I try to sell it vacant, I could lose months or more in rent. \n\nUpvote1Downvote1Go to comments  \n",

         "Two friends (28F) visited me (28F) after years and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — how do I fix things or know if it’s time to let go?",
         "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n\nT lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n\nThere were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n\nT also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n\nThe night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n\nAfter she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n\nThere was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.\n\nTo be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.\n\n# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nTwo old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I’m wondering how to fix things — or if I should just move on. How do I handle this?",

         "I (F23) had a breakdown and now I’m scared I’m ruining my relationship with my boyfriend",
         "Hi Reddit. I don’t really post, but I need to vent and maybe get some advice because I feel completely lost right now.\n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost two years. We’ve talked about moving in together soon, and while I’m excited, I’m also nervous. I have anxiety, and it really affects how I process emotions and interact with the world. I overthink *everything*. I also tend to cry a lot when I’m overwhelmed, which makes it hard to communicate clearly and it makes me feel ashamed.\n\nOver the long weekend, I went to visit my boyfriend. He lives one town over. He was playing video games, and I didn’t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead. About 30 minutes later, he came out and (in what felt like an aggressive tone) said:  \n“Can you stop having an attitude?”\n\nThat completely threw me off. I didn’t even realize anything was wrong. When I tried to ask what he meant, I got overwhelmed and started crying as I genuinely didn’t know what I had done. He apologized, but I still felt hurt and confused.\n\nThen, as all this was going on, his parents walked in (they had just come in from out of town), and I had to immediately act like nothing was wrong. Internally, I was falling apart. I ended up crying nonstop sunday and monday.\n\nI eventually left early and went back to my apartment. When I got home, I called him and tried to explain what I was feeling. I said something like: “Hey, I’ve been sitting with a lot from this weekend. I know you’re stressed with work stuff, and I really do get that. I just ended up feeling really shut out, and when things got tense, I didn’t feel emotionally okay staying. I also know I shut down around your parents  I just felt exhausted and didn’t know how to talk about it.\"\n\nHis immediate response was: “I think you need to go back to therapy.”\n\nThat hurt. I know he’s stressed, but I felt dismissed. It made me question everything. Since then, we’ve been distant. I love him a lot, but now I’m wondering… is it over? Did I mess this all up?\n\nTLDR: I (23F) visited my boyfriend (26M) over the weekend. He got upset and told me to “stop having an attitude” when I was just watching TV alone. I got overwhelmed, started crying, and felt really dismissed. His parents walked in mid-breakdown, and I had to pretend I was fine. I left early and tried to calmly explain my feelings later, but he just told me I “need to go back to therapy.” Now we’re distant, and I feel confused, ashamed, and wondering if this relationship is right or if I messed it all up.

         "I [18F] don't know how to tell my [18M] boyfriend that I need him to be more attentive.",
         "TL,DR: I don't think my boyfriend is showing me enough attention and isn't picking up any hints, and I always have to tell him everything in order for him to actually do something for me. How do I bring it up without whining/complaining too much, since we had a pretty similar conversation about the same topic not too long ago?\n\n\n\n\nI have a loving boyfriend. We've been friends for a few years before getting together, and he was so much better than my other friends at the time because we could bond over shared bad/traumatic experiences, but also general taste, opinions, thoughts and so on. \nWe got together 7 months ago, and while we had a few problems here and there, we worked through them as we promised to communicate calmly. However, I may he holding a grudge still and I'm here for opinions and advice.\n\nFor our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all), I made him a nice present and bought him a book - nothing fancy but still personal and I did put in effort. He bought me nothing. He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either, but I was fine with both as I enjoyed his company and I don't really need material things or gifts from him to feel loved, and besides, he already got me nice gifts for our first month together. But then again, is it that difficult to get/make a small thing? Or make/buy a small, spontaneous gift without me always having to ask? He's awkward and somewhat insecure, afraid of making mistakes or \"driving me away\" (despite me repeatedly telling him that I genuinely couldn't care less about what gift he gets me/makes me as long it's not something I openly hate. I love him to death). I told him how I felt hurt about some stuff and needed him to pick up hints and notice behaviours or patterns that I do when I'm, for example, upset (which are very obvious and we've discussed them thoroughly a few times, even before we got together). He apologised and said he'd try and notice more and be there for me in the future, so we soothed that out - or so I thought, I guess.\n\nI've had a urinary infection not too long ago and I've only recently recovered from it, but I got sick a few days ago (a somewhat serious cold but nothing dangerous) which is making me exhausted and irritable. I've been having check-ups and talks with the doctors at least twice a week these past few weeks because of both the urinary infection and now the cold, and not once has he offered on his own to even keep me company. Which I find hurtful.\n\nI understand that he's busy with his school and that maybe he's not in the mood to get out of the house or something, but it still hurts that he doesn't even offer help or to visit me. A few times he just outright forgot or ignored that I'm sick, until I reminded him. He hasn't gotten me anything to eat/drink when I invited him to come over (and only because it was also convenient for him, and he used to get me stuff, especially sweets and food like that before). \nBut whatever, that's fine. But he also seems.. uncaring, or disinterested. Is it really that hard to just reply to my message telling him I'm going to the hospital because I feel like shit and my health isn't improving with more than \"owww, rest up\"? Is saying something like \"I'm busy/tired/whatever today but if I could, I'd keep you company\" really that difficult, even if it's a lie? \nIt's literally the same aforementioned talk about attention and spontaneous acts of kindness (whether physical, verbal, in terms of gifts) that we had. And I'm tired of always asking things of people, especially of him. When he's sick, I make sure to buy him his favourite snacks, to cuddle with him, to offer to take care of him and try to do it should the circumstances allow. But he just doesn't return the favour despite me telling him, more than once, that I'd appreciate such things, even if just an attempt or offer. I don't get why, and if I'm just an asshole or seeking attention. I don't know how to tell him all of this without sounding like I'm whining/complaining too much. How do I tell him, what do I do? How do I communicate properly with him and let him know?\nAny help/advice is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post.\n",

         "On and off relationship for 8 years. Don't know what to do next, advice?",
         "I [22F] and my [M25] boyfriend have been together officially for 7 years. We took a break last year, I broke up with him because I felt as though my needs weren't being met and I felt neglected and like I wasn't important to him. \n\nWe've been seeing each other regularly for the last year but he doesn't want to put a label on anything yet. He's currently in school and his family basically hates me for leaving him for someone else. \n\nFor some background information to better understand, his family is very emotionally unavailable and I came from a very emotional family and have learned its best to talk things out and express emotions and feelings instead of sweeping them under the rug. \n\nHis mother would make fun of me for not knowing basic things in front of their family members and make fun of personal problems I have with sensory things and he would never say anything in my defense after expressing that it hurt my feelings.They would bash my family and judge me if I ever came to them for guidance as I do not stay in contact with my own family anymore and don't have many friends thinking I could come to her as she'd call me the daughter she never had.\n\nOver the years I felt like I did most of the sacrificing in our relationship, driving every weekend to see him after he refused to leave his apartment with his roommates to spend the weekend at my apartment where I lived alone because he didn't have his PC with him or he didn't have his rig. \n\nWe spent a limited amount of time together alone without videogames or getting high, mainly when we'd run errands or be waiting for his friends to get home, from work, or watching tiktoks. When his friends got home I'd basically be sitting around bored for hours and sometimes crying because I felt left out and unwanted. His friend is very disrespectful to women and would subject him to grossly inappropriate content and games where he'd be playing as an unrealistic nude girl with unlimited customization options. \n\nWhen we would be intimate together, he'd always ask me to dress up and basically be something that I'm not, it got to the point where he'd be watching porn while we were doing things and there was a few times that I would cry or break down during it and it was just awful and extremely unhealthy for my already existing insecurities from being body shamed my whole life by my family, I weigh 230lbs and have a nice figure for my weight and height. \n\nI was very verbal through the entirety of our relationship with how he made me feel, making me be something I'm not, never complimenting me after basically asking in every way possible, never emotionally being there for me when I was going through personal and family problems. Sometimes I feel like we're incompatible but I love him very deeply and part of me feels that way because he was my first intimate partner but Im in love with him.\n\nOver they years I discovered his porn addiction and him micro cheating in private chat rooms. I've also found a post on hook up pages on Reddit which he swore he never followed through with in person. His social media algorithms are so personalized that even on Facebook he can't scroll for like two minutes without seeing boobs or something inappropriate. On tiktok is ads for sexy outfits, girls thrist trapping like every 10 to 15 videos. He's now asking about me wearing more specific things which im not entirely comfortable with.. I love him so I want to make him happy but I'm also afraid that I'm disrespecting myself and if I say no he'll find it somewhere else or resort back to chat rooms if he ever stopped that to begin with.. we're not even officially together but we're exclusive according to him, even though he won't tell anyone about us and we aren't living together.. \n\nI've talked to my friends about this many many times over the years and they all say the same thing, that it's not a good match, he isn't treating me the way a boyfriend should, that I deserve better. In my heart I think I  know that but I don't know what I'd do without him. He understands me so well but at the same time not in the ways I need him to understand me. We've talked about doing relationship counseling but even if we do, I'm scared his family will still hate me and be unkind to me and I'm worried that I'll still feel this way. \n\nTl;dr - what to do? Am I in the wrong, should I be more understanding and supportive? Am I allowing myself to be mistreated? Advice ",

         "How did you feel when she said “I love you” first ?",
         "So I(25F)’ve been in a relationship with my partner (25M) for a few weeks. We dated for about two months before making it official, but we’ve known each other for over 8 months (we actually lived together as housemates for 6 of those months).\n\nToday, after he came to see me, I couldn’t hold it in any longer and told him that I love him. He didn’t really react, and now I’m not sure what to think. I did tell him beforehand that he shouldn’t feel pressured to say it back or to say anything at all tho. just wanted him to know how I felt.\n\nStill, I have to admit I was a bit surprised. The morning after he asked me to be his girlfriend, as he was leaving my place, he kissed me and said “love you.” It caught me off guard. I kissed him back and ended up saying it too, kind of instinctively. But since then, I’ve been wondering whether he truly meant it as “I’m in love with you,” or if it was just a casual way of expressing affection.\n\nOver the weekend, after thinking a lot, I realized that I really am in love with him. That led to our conversation today. I first asked him what he meant when he said “love you” that morning, and he said it meant he has “a lot of love” for me. I’m not entirely sure what that means, to be honest.\n\nThen I told him that I was in love with him. He stayed calm, kissed me, smiled—and that was it. No words.\n\nSo now I’m feeling a bit confused. I don’t want him to feel pressured in any way, but I also can’t help wondering if he felt uncomfortable, or if it was just too soon for him. Could I have scared him off? Should I have kept that to myself a little longer? Does that silence mean something?\n\nOr maybe a part of me is just trying to find reassurance from complete strangers on the eventuality that he loves me back but is just not ready to say it.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in this situation—how did you feel when she said “I love you” first?\n\nTL;DR: I (25F) told my boyfriend (27M) I love him after a few weeks of being official (but knowing each other for 8 months). He didn’t say it back, just smiled and kissed me. He once said “love you” before but explained it meant he had “a lot of love” for me. Did I say it too soon? Should I be worried?\n\n",

         "Cutting ties with family member who is hosting an important family function - what should I do?",
         "Throwaway bc I don’t want family to find this. \n\nThere’s a lot of necessary backstory so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n\nA couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n\nFast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n\nWe recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n\nI have decided to explicitly say I can’t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n\nNow the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nTLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can’t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don’t want to be two-faced but also don’t want to cause more family drama and tension. \n\n",

         "\nMy girlfriend (20F) and my parents don’t get along, and now I (20M) feel stuck in the middle\n\nBody:\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend since high school — about 2 years now. We’re both 19 and currently sophomores in college. Things between us have been great, but there’s a serious issue with how she and my family (especially my parents and brother) get along — or rather, don’t get along.\n\nThe latest problem started on Easter. She came over to my parents’ house, brought a gift, dressed nicely, and made conversation during dinner. After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother. They said she rolled her eyes every time he spoke and that she’s done this for years (though I honestly haven’t noticed that). They also said she came off as cold and dismissive toward them.\n\nMy girlfriend was shocked to hear that. From her perspective, she’s always tried to be polite, and she feels like my parents never really liked her and are constantly looking for reasons to dislike her. Because of that, she no longer feels comfortable coming over. She thinks anything she does will be twisted into something negative.\n\nNow my parents are asking for an apology from her. It’s been about a month and she hasn’t apologized, because she doesn’t feel like she did anything wrong. Meanwhile, my parents say they’re losing what little respect they had for her, and it’s clear they don’t want her around until she “makes things right.”\n\nSo now I’m stuck. I love her and want this relationship to work, but I also want peace with my family. I hate this tension, and it’s hard feeling like I have to pick a side. I’ve tried talking to both sides, but neither is budging. I don’t even know what a “solution” looks like anymore.\n\nIf anyone’s been through something like this or has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, but she and my parents don’t get along. After Easter dinner, my parents said she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my brother. She says they’ve never liked her and now refuses to go over. My parents want an apology, she refuses, and I’m stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace. Not sure what to do.\n",

         "I'm starting to think I'm crazy, need honest input about possible cheating",
         "I'm a 40 (f) and my partner 38 (f).\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nMy partner and I together for over 5 years. When we met she told me about an online friendship we had with a man she was interested in. They met online and started talking. He's a \"public figure\" of sorts and asked her to meet up and go for a walk. She never met up with him, but I could tell by the way she told the story that she was very impressed with him and somewhat shocked he wanted to meet up.\n\nFast forward, I know she still has a friendship with this person. She mentions him once in a blue moon (a project he's working on or something like that.) One time, she mentions that he would like to meet me. I find this a bit strange, because I've never had a conversation with him or any connection. I know that while they've had this online relationship, they've never met in person.\n\nFast forward a few months ago, she flies to LA for a work event. I pick her up from the airport and notice she is DMing someone. I notice she's DMing for quite a while. I only read on the screen \"did you get home?\" And I see the name. This person is this man's ex partner. They still coparent and live together (strange I know). I get a very weird feeling in my gut. I'm thinking to myself, did she meet this person and his coparent? I can't get it off my mind, so the next day I ask \"did you see (persons name) when you were in LA?\" Immediately she answers \"yes.\" I ask her where and she says she went to their house and played with their kid. I ask her why she didn't tell me. I am at this point feeling very confused and upset. My ex has social anxiety and drove over 40 minutes to these people's house. It's unlike her.\n\nI start asking her questions, specifically why she wasn't honest about going there. She gets highly defensive. She starts yelling and telling me I'm crazy. Her reaction makes my stomach sink. I tell her something is going on here, and I have never had a feeling like this before. Specifically with this man. The next day, he DM's me and basically tells me that nothing at all happened, and that he doesn't appreciate me making an assumption. I found out my ex told him private parts of our conversation. I feel completely betrayed. And I'm made to look crazy.\n\nA few months ago, I'm going through financial records. I recognize a bunch of charges from 2023-present to this one company. I come to find out this is this man's company. He hosts webinars and you only need to pay a donation fee. I don't want to share the exact amount, but it comes to my attention that my ex has spent over $5,000 going to these webinars and I was not aware. She never told me this. Each charge is around $500 with a few for $1000. Now I'm really feeling betrayed. Especially because our shared funds were paying for his events, and he was outright accusatory towards me. She never once told me she was attending these events, let alone making such large donations. She had filed them with our bookkeeper as \"charity.\"\n\nThis makes me go through her phone records and I see that she is still having a few phone calls with him. Even after I'm upset about her going to his house. I was under the impression that after she violated my boundaries and shared personal information with him, that she didn't speak with him anymore. But she did, after he was rude towards me.\n\nAdvice is much needed and appreciated\n\nTLDR: Partner was caught going to a home of someone she was interested in the past. I know his coparent was there, but it still felt weird because she lied about it. She then told him I suspected something was going on and he (somewhat) told me off on DM. I also came to find out she spent $5,000 over a year and a half on his webinars that she never mentioned to me.",

         "My (30F) boyfriend (40M) doesn’t want to be intimate with me",
         "My boyfriend and I have dated for 7 months. We started out with me pretty avoidant and recently single after dating a sociopath that really screwed me up. Slowly he made me open up and was extremely caring- more caring than anyone I’ve ever been with. \n\nHe understood my slowness and avoidant nature and was patient. Eventually we became physical and we were completely attached at the hip- to the point where he has lived with me since the first time we had sex. We were intimate constantly sometimes 6 times a day and he couldn’t keep his hands off me. Of note, he is also on testosterone and other supplements that increase his libido. \n\nWe started having some arguments and major issues from them. All our issues came out and he was under major stress- a new job, worse pay, injured himself so he couldn’t work out (he was working out daily before that), pressure from his second job, and then there were rumors about him and a coworker who was known to sleep around with married men. I’m the kind of person who wants to talk things out and voice issues and I’m highly emotional and he’s more of the shut down avoid and think about things- he self isolated and blames himself for being “dysfunctional” and states he “can’t feel his feelings because they’re wrong” and it’s always his fault. He says these things not in a passive aggressive way but truly things he’s just not meant to be with someone because of his inner issues. \n\nWhen all of these issues started coming up we he stopped being intimidate with me. It was like it completely ended. In the last two and a half months we have had sex once and I almost felt like I forced him because he had a “I guess I’ll do this” attitude the entire time. \n\nWhen I talked to him about it he says it’s because of our issues and he just isn’t sexually aroused when we have underlining issues going on. Then recently he also said he feels like he doesn’t turn me off. I’ve always had difficultly orgasming and he feels like it’s him. I literally have had one orgasm before that was not caused by me so it’s not like it’s a him thing- which he knows all of this. I also have been more dry lately- I’m not sure why, I’m still attracted to him but I have been on increased antidepressants which have dried my mouth out so maybe that’s a reason? But he said that doesn’t make him feel good either. \n\nI’m having a hard time not feeling unwanted and undesired with all of this. Tonight I tried to put moves on him again and he just didn’t do anything. I cannot have a sexless relationship. Has anyone dealt with this before? How to I navigate this? Do I give him more time as things seem to be getting better in our relationship? \n\nTLDR: fighting has caused my boyfriend not to have sex with me for 2+ months and I’m going insane thinking I’m unwanted and unattractive",

         "Is my partner [20 F] cheating on me [20 F] or am I overreacting?",
         "My partner \\[20 F\\] and I \\[20 F\\] have been dating for about 4 years in total now. We dated for around 2 years at age 16 and broke up due to differences and emotional cheating which she admitted too. We were separated for about 9 months to a year and then have got back together.\n\nThings were going well until a couple of weeks ago, when we were hanging out and i opened her phone to find she had been snapping a guy who I'd never heard her mention before. I knew that nothing would be going on as she let me have free access to her phone, however when I looked at what was actually being said he had sent a a screenshot of a map of how far away his house was from hers. When i asked about it she said she was only going to answer a couple more messages and then block him.\n\nThen I discovered recently that while she was away on a work trip she had been in a guys hotel room, cuddling on his bed and watching TV. This guy I knew was her friend, however in the period that we were broken up he made it clear that he wanted to sleep with my partner. Furthermore, there is another different guy that she works with who she keeps meeting up with one on one to go on night time drives with. This guy has a girlfriend but I feel the distance between us and can't help thinking all of this is playing into it all. \n\nWhat doesn't help is that I go to university in a different city so we already have physical distance. So reddit, is there a chance my partner is cheating on me, or am I reading too far into this?\n\nTL;DR - My girlfriend (both 20F) and I have been together 4 years, with a 9-month breakup due to her emotional cheating. Lately, I found out she was Snapchatting a guy who sent her his location, cuddled with another guy (who once said he wanted to sleep with her) during a work trip, and goes on late-night drives with a male coworker. We're long-distance, and it's making me question if she's cheating or if I'm just overthinking",

         "My (21F) boyfriend's (23M) grandmother recently passed away and I don't know how best to support him",
         "Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.\n\nVery recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. \n\nHe's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like \"I'm alright\" or \"Yeah, thanks for being here\". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.\n\nHis friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. \n\nBut, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?\n\nI know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. \n\nSorry that it came out so long and massive apologies if a lot of it sounded like one, big whine. I just thought it relevant to show why and how I've been feeling helpless alongside some other contexts. I'm also not a big poster so sorry if some things are not right!\n\nTL;DR My long-time boyfriend's grandmother passed away very recently and I've felt useless in being there for him as I'm not sure how to. Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do. ",

         "Do I (18F) cut my friend(18F) off ?",
         "I had a friend group last year. This year I wasn't in their class. I had trouble including myself in convos at lunch but tried making efforts. Once I asked to come to a party and they invented an excuse so i didnt come because they didn't want the friend I was bringing. I let that pass and then they were planning a hang out to the skating rink. I couldnt come but nobody asked me. I told them why I couldnt but they didn't care and I didn't think much of it it wasn't a big deal.\nBut then some days later I learned that one girl was saying that if I came she wouldnt come. I confronted her, and asked my closest friends about it. She told me she was here if I wanted to talk, but didn't it was late at night so she stopped responding. But she never responded to my messages after that. It hurted me but I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward last month I learned that I wasn't invited to a big hang out because I distanced myself too much and the mean girl said that if I was coming she wouldn't come again even though i thought she would stop after talking to her about it. I talked to my closest friend, she told me to get over it (wasn't mean saying it) but I tried to communicate to understand but she would disregard a lot a my messages. About the thing the girl said she said that she couldnt ask me to hang out because some people didnt want me there, but admitted that i was progressively excluded from hang outs. Also, i asked why she wasnt telling me what was happening, she told me that i already knew everything and that i knew more than her about the story. Didn't have the chance to talk more about the subject as she wanted to stop talking about it. I thought that maybe I didn't communicate enough beforehand but I just found out texts from just a few days after learning all about the first exclusion where I complained about being excluded and that nobody was doing anything about it. My closest friend saw it but never responded. It really makes me want to just stop talking to her as we already don't talk much. But she is also the only one in the group to do efforts for my bd and stated multiple times that she didn't us to drift apart.\n \nMoreover, she complained multiples times last year that she didn't feel included in the group and I always reassured her and at least asked if she was coming to some hang outs\n \nI feel like im becoming crazy as the only mean girl in the group was the one I talked about in the beginning. My friend was a nice person so I can't help but thinking I might do a mistake cutting her of but I can't help but ressent her now\n(Sorry for my bad English)\nTL;DR : mean girl excludes me and my closest friend in the group does nothing about it.",

      "Body text: My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.\n",

      "Body text: For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?\n",

I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n",

Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people.

I realize this is an imposition on them and we've all discussed it a lot. I always give them 24 hours if someone wants to look at the house. My ask is that it is clean and in order, but not that it look spotless. My partner has struggled big time with his boys around cleanliness in general (regardless of me). He doesn't know how to set and/or hold boundaries with them around this. He had said that he thought the house being on the market would help him to hold them more accountable for keeping the house clean.\n",

The feedback I've now received from both him and someone who cleaned the house professionally are \"unkempt\", \"filthy\", \"disrespected\"...and the litter box has been described as not being taken care of. My partner, his kids, and I have already had one hard conversation about this. I am messy. I'm often a hot mess! But my place is mostly clean. My partner says that he checks the house before it is shown and that it is relatively clean. I guess i'm just not sure what's happening. Hearing about this feedback and seeing how dirty it was the day it was photographed, makes me feel uncared about. \n",

      "Title: Two friends (28F) visited me (28F) after years and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — how do I fix things or know if it’s time to let go?\n",
      "Body text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n",
      "\n",
      "T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?\n",

He was playing video games, and I didn’t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead.
