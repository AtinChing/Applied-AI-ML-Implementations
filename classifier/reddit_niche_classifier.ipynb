    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**\n\nAskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.\n\nThis is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.\n\n\\-The AskReddit mods",

         "We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \\_\\_\\_\\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a \"shower thought\" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.\n* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe Ass Credit Mods",

One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers.

She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n\nHowever, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n\nI tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.\n\nNow, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.\n\nI'm not sure what I should do, or what I *can* do. I don't know what to apologize *for* and I feel like my friends are siding with her.\n\nTL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.",

         "\n36F 37M we've been together for 3.5 years \n\nTL;DR My \"perfect\" boyfriend risked my life and didn't think it was a big deal.\n\n\nI’m upset because my boyfriend didn’t tell me I had a seizure until 11:45 PM the next day. I’m having a bad reaction to my seizure meds and working closely with my neurologist, so I needed to know right away—especially because I drove that day, which I never would’ve done if I knew.\n\nHe told me not to talk to him that day because he was “busy at work,” but later admitted it was really because I was being clingy. He didn’t check on me once, and still told me what meals he wanted, knowing I’d have to drive to the store to get ingredients.\n\nI feel ignored, unimportant, and honestly unsafe—not just because of what happened, but because of how he handled it.\n\nHe's never done anything remotely like this, been together 3.5 years and it's been amazing \n \nAfter I told him not to talk to me (we live together) and he respected that.\n\nTold him yesterday I'm ready to talk but I'm unsure what to say",

         "My partner (25F) and I (33M) have been together for 5 years and recently became parents to a 6-month-old. Since the birth, I’ve experienced a huge drop in libido. I don’t feel the same desire for intimacy anymore, and it’s become a real issue in our relationship.\n\nShe doesn’t pressure me for sex, but she’s internalizing the change. She asks if I think she’s fat or unattractive and says she feels rejected. I’ve told her honestly that I still find her beautiful and that this change is coming from me, not from anything she’s done. But she doesn’t believe me.\n\nIt’s now impacting our emotional closeness. She’s more withdrawn, less affectionate, and I can feel a growing distance. I want to reconnect with her, but I don’t know how to repair this gap while I’m still feeling disconnected from myself too.\n\n**Length of Relationship:**  \nTogether 4 years, baby is 6 months old\n\n**What I’m looking for advice on:**  \nWhat are healthy ways to rebuild emotional and physical intimacy when one partner is experiencing low libido? How can I make her feel seen and loved while I work through this? I’m also open to advice from anyone who's gone through something similar postpartum (as a partner or parent).\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nSince our baby was born, I \\[33M\\] have almost no sex drive. My partner \\[25F\\] thinks I find her unattractive, and it’s affecting our connection. I want to make things better but don’t know where to start.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nWife and I read the comments. Truly appreciate you all. We have decided to talk about some of the advice mentioned in the thread. Also, I will call the doctor first thing tomorrow to check my testosterone levels. ",

         "I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.",
         "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n\nFor context:\n\n* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n\nBefore moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n\nAt the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nAbout the dog:\n\n* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n\nFast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n\nAfter 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n\n**How should I approach this conversation with him?**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMoved in with my boyfriend (M/27) last year. Despite agreeing to hold off on getting a dog, he pressured me into it a month later. He travels a lot, and I end up being the sole caretaker for both his anxious herding dog and my own lower maintenance dog. After 10 days of solo dog duty, I’ve hit a breaking point. I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.",

         "Hi yall,\n\nSo i just needed some advice. me and my friend who hasn’t had sex in 2 years have been ig seeing eachother the past 2 weeks. we kissed twice prior to this weekend. so as u can tell things were getting serious. We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n\nTl:dr i was making out with a friend and was about to have sex, as soon as i was ready to put it in i became soft, need advice",

         "I ended my engagement and have regrets. (27F) (30M)",
         "Hi everyone,\nI (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n\nBut things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n\nHis family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him. And still, when I asked for support or tried to express how I felt, I was told I was making things about me or being too sensitive.\n\nAs time went on, I started to feel like the relationship was incredibly one-sided. His goals, his plans, and his needs always came first. Mine were often ignored or treated like they weren’t as important. I still loved him, but I didn’t feel like I mattered. The emotional weight of the relationship became too much.\n\nThe last straw was when he brought up a prenup. It wasn’t the fact that he wanted one, but the way and timing of how it came up. It made me feel even more like I wasn’t truly seen or trusted. It confirmed what I had already been feeling for a long time. I didn’t feel like an equal, and I didn’t feel emotionally safe.\n\nI eventually made the decision to walk away. And even though part of me feels clear about why I left, another part of me keeps wondering if I made the right call. Maybe it was just a hard season. Maybe I was overwhelmed. Or maybe choosing myself was exactly what I needed to do.\n\nI still care about him. I still think about the good moments. But I also know how hard it felt to be in it.\n\nAny honest thoughts or perspective would mean a lot. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR:\nEnded a 4 year relationship after getting engaged. We argued constantly, I felt unheard and unappreciated, and the way he brought up a prenup was the final straw. Still love him, but I didn’t feel emotionally safe. Now I’m wondering if I gave up too soon.",

         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?",
         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself 24/7. \n\n\n• Every time I do something it’s always “why are you doing it like that?” or “why don’t you just do this” or even more aggravating, he says “that’s unnecessary”. Every single day. I will say I want to do something a certain way and he questions me about it and I explain to him why I want to do something the way I want and it’s deemed “unnecessary” (his words) even if it has absolutely nothing to do with him. He’s told me before that he does it to help me but I have my own reasons for doing things my way. Even when he explains to me why he thinks it’s unnecessary to do something the way I want, I listen to him and consider his suggestion and go with my way and he calls me crazy for not listening to his advice that I never asked for. \nMy husband is very intelligent, I would say he is much smarter than me and I think some of his ways are efficient but it’s the fact that I cannot have my own ideas without criticism. \n\nEVERY TIME I do chores, he will ask me if I’m okay and I’ll say “yeah I just have a lot to do”(i do all the house chores and take care of our four month old baby and he goes to work, does the outdoor stuff and takes out the trash) and EVERY TIME he’ll say “well dont do that right now it’s unnecessary. Go lay down and take a nap, I’ll do it later”. I tried that before, you know, let him “do it later” like he said; just to see when exactly “later” meant to him and the laundry piled up so bad it was overflowing and covering the entire floor, the dishes stunk in the sink, the house was a mess. I told him this is what happens when you say “I’ll do it later” and this is why I don’t feel comfortable waiting to do chores. He said “I was getting to it”. Yeah make me feel like crap for doing chores and tell me you’ll take care of it then proceed to not do what you said you’d do. \n\n• On top of that, he doesn’t like listening to the stuff I enjoy talking about. For example, I will read a book a really enjoy and I’m so excited to talk about it with him, if he isn’t interested, he just stares blankly at me and says nothing. He listens which I appreciate but if it’s something he just doesn’t care about, he says “and?” or he just nods his head and turns away. \n\nNow I understand if you’re not interested in something it’s hard to act like you are but he tells me stuff 50 times a day I don’t care about at all like politics, or what’s in the news, or something in his game, or just random stupid facts. The difference between him and me when it comes to that is I try to be interested or I will at least I pretend to be. He doesn’t even try. It makes me feel so small when he does this to me. \n\n————————————————————————\n\n- We’ve had a conversation about this MANY times and I’ve told him that it makes me feel terrible about myself and he always says “well that’s just who I am, I can’t change that”. I don’t know what to say to that. I just stop talking after that. I have addressed many issues I’ve had with him before and he’s changed his ways but this he can’t change. \n\n- I just decided not to talk to him a lot anymore. Not about something I’m interested in or excited about, not when I’m doing stuff, I just try to avoid his words. I know he loves me and he does prove it to me every day by giving me love and affection and doing things for me and helping me around the house (when he feels like it) but these things just make me feel super bad about myself. Am I overreacting? \n\nTL;DR My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: As I’m reading some of the comments, I see that this behavior is not normal and that I am not overreacting. I always heard that marriage is hard but I genuinely do believe that he cares about me and he loves me because he shows me and he HAS changed his ways before when I brought up other issues I’ve had with him. I’m going to try different approaches and see how that works now that I am more aware of how he is treating me is wrong. Thank you everyone for your advice and opening my eyes. ",
