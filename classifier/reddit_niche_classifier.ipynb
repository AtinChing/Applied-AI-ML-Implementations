I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.\n",

      "I started by saying: \"So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. \n",

      "She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. \n",
      "\n",
      "I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  \n",
      "2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an \"issue\" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   \n",
      "3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. \n",
      "\n",
      "And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.\n",

      "Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):\n",
      "1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.\n",
      "2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my \"next spouse\" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. \n",
      "3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.\n",
      "4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!\n",
      "5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.\n",
      "6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.\n",
      "7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex\n",
      "8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. \n",

      "10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary\n",
      "11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.\n",
      "12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.\n",
      "13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message \n",
      "14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.\n",
      "15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.\n",

      "I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.\n",

She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, \"deluding herself into thinking she's actually home\", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).\n",

My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge.

      "I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a low point, I said to my husband: \"You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring.\" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3\n",

      "Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.\n",

      "\n",
      "After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to \"command\" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.\n",
      "\n",
      "You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!\n",

I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.\n",

      "He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago.

      "Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).\n",

He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.\n",

I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support.

Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it.

He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around.

My husband heard the whole thing and my last memory before I lost consciousness was him screaming my name. \n",

I love him so much and so yesterday while shopping, I saw this gorgeous black lingerie set and decided to surprise him.

Then he spent hours calling family members, waiting, pacing and trying to grapple with the fact that I might die and he might be alone. Then I spent five days in the ICU, mostly unconscious. He said he’s never known fear like that in his life. \n",

He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: \"I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!\" \n",

I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason.

He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, \"I'm not sure myself.

She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.\n",

      "I trust my boyfriend completely. Even if I didn't, this apartment is large, not massive....I know where that beloved MF is 24/7. A lot of you asked when after my housemates confession he told me about it: he  told me a couple of hours afterwards. He explained to me after we had a chat about it that he was afraid I wouldn't believe him or be angry, because at first he'd thought it was a weird joke that made him uncomfortable, and he felt (rightly so) weirded out. I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you. It's not easy, and you can quickly find yourself unsure if those brief moments of crossing a line happened. He's not on our lease, and understandably he was concerned about me and the power dynamic in the house (bc her room is a mini granny flat, she pays the bigger share).\n",
      "\n",
      "I also don't believe that it was, as some suggested, a hypomanic episode.

      "Yesterday, after a tense few days of trying to avoid her, my BF and I were in the kitchen at breakfast, with her around in the living area. I went to 'our' bathroom (she has an en suite) which is just off the main area to brush my teeth. I walked back out to grab my phone as she was sidling behind my boyfriend who was looking in the fridge, and caught her *running her hand and forearm across his lower back where his tee shirt had ridden up a little*. My boyfriend, who didn't see me, yelped really loudly and just lost it. He yelled at her to \"stop!\" and when they both saw me he starts going \"you see?! You see?! This is what I was talking about!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was furious, just whole body anger, and I could see she had now realised he HAD told me about her confession/behaviour, and just sprinted to her room and slammed the door. My BF and I went out for a walk to calm down, and he kept apologising for not being \"more firm\", but he was shaken up - some of you told me I should just confront her head on, which in the moment I 100% sided with, I was so angry for him. He told me he'd rather give her the opportunity to do it diplomatically. I appreciated what you guys said about lock down being extenuating, and in discussion with our mutual friend, I was willing to believe that an element of it was naivete, and a bit of fantasy gone too far. I was willing to be kind to her.\n",

Come late afternoon, I was just over it, so I knocked, and told her I was coming in. I sat her down on her bed and told her gently but firmly it was inappopriate, making us uncomfortable, told her she had to get the hell over it/herself if she intended to continue to live with us. She burst into tears and starts crying about how she's \"so sorry\" and what a \"bad person' she is, and she can't believe the pressure of lockdown is getting to her, whatever, and I felt bad. Started sympathising, trying to be compassionate...and then she says \"It's just so unfair that the guy I'm in love with has a really great girlfriend\".\n",

      "Reader, I lost my shit. Unfair, *my ass.* I told her she had a lot of growing up to do, and perspective to learn, and that she owed the house an apology. She started to have a meltdown, a full, weeping, hiccuping snotty meltdown. *AND THEN*  when I stood up to leave, I spotted, in her clothes rack, my freaking shirt. I took it, and went back to my room.\n",

      "My housemate cried loudy with the door OPEN until 7PM (for....attention???) when I cracked. I used our emergency contact sheet, called her mum, told her she had to come pick up my housemate. I've never met this woman who came rushing in like a superstar, but the look of annoyance and embrassament on her face when she arrived and found her 27 y/o daughter having a tantrum told me this wasn't a new part of her personality. My housemate also STFU pretty quickly after she realised her mum was there. They didn't say anything to us, and we just hid in our room until they were gone. I think she'll be gone at least for a while, but I texted her to let her know it would be best if she texted me before she came back. IDK when I'll see her. Technically the lease ends in August so my BF and I think we can make it work and find someone new, and if not, it's not so long til we can resign without her.\n",

      "As a coda to all this?? My BF mentioned if she took a blouse, maybe she took other stuff too. I appreciate some of you may consider this an invasion of privacy, but I did go back in, just to check the clothes rack. I found: a set of my jeans, my tee shirt, one of my boyfriends work shirts, a vinyl I owned, my fucking charm bracelet from when I was a KID from inside my jewellery box, and a sheet of my old antidepressants...this was just what was on the rack/on display. I imagine there's more in the drawers. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I left them there for now bc I don't want there to be any 'doubt' she stole them.  There's zero chance she's going to live here any more. Honestly, I hope she does get help. I'm really angry and violated, as is my BF, but I can empathise with the havoc an uncontrolled mental health issue can wreak on your behviour, and while it's still wrong, it still sucks for her to experience it and lose friends. NOTE: *I can't be sure, none of us can! But I feel like maybe (?) she has a histrionic personality disorder.*\n",
