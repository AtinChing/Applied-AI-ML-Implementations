      "I had one conversation with my husband since everything happenedâ€”by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I donâ€™t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, Iâ€™m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how Iâ€™ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, Iâ€™ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and donâ€™t feel guilty. Itâ€™s so refreshing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who Iâ€™ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired heâ€™s made me feel.  Itâ€™s definitely early and weâ€™re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that Iâ€™m a catch who doesnâ€™t have to settle. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therapy has done wonders and Iâ€™m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. Iâ€™m proud of me. Iâ€™ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failedâ€”not me. Iâ€™m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "So all in all, life is good and thereâ€™s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I canâ€™t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. Iâ€™ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. \n",

      "While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, Iâ€™m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how Iâ€™ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, Iâ€™ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and donâ€™t feel guilty. Itâ€™s so refreshing. \n",

Recently, I found someone who Iâ€™ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired heâ€™s made me feel.  Itâ€™s definitely early and weâ€™re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that Iâ€™m a catch who doesnâ€™t have to settle. \n",

He failedâ€”not me. Iâ€™m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. \n",
