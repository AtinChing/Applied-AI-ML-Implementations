I.e, we can pass our actual existing reddit posts' data into an LLM to give it some ideas and show it some inspiration, and use that to get it to generate more reddit stories that are likely to be viral within a specific chosen niche of our choice.\n",
    "    - Additionally, instead of just passing good known stories into a general-purpose LLM (like Gemini or GPT-based LLMs) like we are right now, we could train or fine-tune a domain-specific LLM that is dedicated for this task (generating reddit posts within a specific niche that are likely to go viral).\n",

    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

         "My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n\nThey started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n\nThey are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.\n\nTL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.",

         "TLDR: My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer care for him. I’m scared because I don’t think I can\n\nI 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.\n\nFor context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.\n\nMy bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.\n\n\nThere’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.\n\n\n",

         "I (39M) have been with my GF (35F) for about 5 years. I love her. The idea of breaking her heart kills me. We live together, have animals together, and have discussed buying a house. She pushes more and more for a ring. The issue is, every time these \"forever\" events get discussed, my mind goes to all the things she does that drive me insane or make me insecure about the relationship.\n\nFor instance, I am very extroverted. I need to be social and hang out with friends or I get very withdrawn and short with people. However, she does not want to go out and do those things regularly. She needs a week to get enough social energy for a few hours out. The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.\n\nI NEED this social stimulation and I understand that she NEEDS to not feel pressured to be social. She has suggested on occasion joining me at some of my events but she wants to get there at the start time and leave either before or as soon as things wrap up because her battery is spent. That cuts into the social aspect for me because its the socialization before and after that really make the events enjoyable.\n\nI cannot imagine starting over again without her, but I also cannot picture a future where I am stuck at home for fear of being nagged about going out again.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My GF is an introvert and I am an extrovert. She wants me at home with her and I want to go out and be social. There does not seem to be a happy medium.",

         "For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself?

         "I’m 30 now, but when I was in my 20’s I was diagnosed with hormone-positive breast cancer. It was an incredibly tough experience, and I went through chemotherapy, surgery, and now I’m on long-term hormone therapy that’s put me into medically induced menopause. \n\nI’ve been with my fiancé for 10 years, and for most of that time, the relationship has been abusive. It’s taken me a long time to even admit that to myself. I know deep down I need to leave. But I’m terrified.\n\nCancer and the treatment have changed my body and my life in ways I never expected. One of the hardest parts is that my vagina doesn’t work the way it used to.  (I can’t go on hormones to help with my issues) I have no libido, painful dryness, and sex has been impossible for years. I’m sure some of this is emotional, being in a relationship where I feel unsafe and unloved,but the menopause meds make it worse.\n\nI’m afraid that if I leave him, no one will ever want me. I’m scared I’ll be alone forever. I don’t feel desirable. I don’t feel whole. The idea of dating again,of having to explain all of this to someone, is overwhelming. Who would want to be with someone who’s been through all this and whose body is still dealing with the aftermath?\nI think I’m also terrified to leave in case god forbid I have a cancer reoccurrence. \n\nBut at the same time… I know I can’t stay in a relationship that’s slowly killing my spirit.\n\nIf anyone out there has been through something similar,leaving an abusive relationship, dating after cancer, dealing with menopause, I would be so grateful to hear your story. I just need to know it’s possible to start over. That there are people out there who will love me as I am.\n\nTL;DR: I’m 30, had breast cancer in my 20s, and I’m in a long-term abusive relationship. Treatment put me into menopause, and I’ve had sexual health issues for years. I’m terrified to leave because I feel like no one will want me — but I know I can’t stay.",

         "I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n\nTo add more insight, I had schedule this trip at a specific time frame that worked best for her and her friends. This time frame pretty inconvenient for me since I go back to work the following day I come back from the trip. I've had to plan dates around her friends schedule since I met her. Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people. I am at a point where I am constantly thinking about ending things but worried this is trivial or non-issue thing to complain about. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore.\n\ntl;dr: Is it worth continuing a relationship if you aren't the priority? I personally couldn't marry someone doing this to me. Or do I try other forms of communication to salvage it?",

However, I have serious reservations which is putting me off the idea. \n\nHer Dad is obbessed with conspiracy theories, Anti Medicine, screams, shouts and swears when confronted. He never calls her unless she calls him; he never visits her, only her visiting him even though he lives doors away. He has threatened every member of family. He does not take responsibility for anything that has happened in his life and goes crazy if challenged on any of his views. Blaming his aggression as out of his control, followed by a sob story and crying.\n\nHer Mum treats her like a child, she is very immature and loves family drama and gossip. \n\nHer mum and dad are not together but still obsessively stay in touch. They point score and can often be insufferable, the roles are reversed. Dad living with sister due to dad not being able manage his finances as wastes all money on Cigerettes and Cannabis. Mum is every emotional and demands children's attention. \n\nMy GF is submissive to them both, can never challenge their views, so let's dad fall deeper in to his views and his behaviour is widely accepted within the family. Same cycle of dad being abusive, apologies, crys they all hug him.\n\nI cannot bring a child in to this environment. I need her to prove to me that she can stand up to them and do what's best for her and our future child. Right now I don't believe she can. \n\nIs this too much for to ask of her? \n\nAny tips on what she can do? \n\nShe is planning a 30th girls night out, even this she felt compelled to invite her dad to avoid upsetting him. Whenever I try to talk to her about standing up she runs away in to another room\n\nAnother example of something really wrong is that last year her nan passed away, her dad during his daughters grieving keeps saying she was murdered by the NHS and trying show weird autopsy videos. When she asked him stop he kicked off.\n\nPlease help\n\nTL;DR Dad & Parents controlling, GF is scared confrontation. Putting me off children. Need advice.",

         "Middle aged divorced woman with ADHD dating middle aged man with ADHD who has two young adult sons with ADHD. Whew! We've been together almost 4 years. \n\nI love learning about ADHD, find lots of value in getting ideas from others, discussing, etc. My partner was diagnosed with ADHD and takes medication, but is very triggered by the topic in a way that I'm not completely clear on. He does not like it when I bring up the topic.\n\nHe is living in another house that I own (not living with me) with his 2 young adult sons. I am trying to sell the house. I realize this is an imposition on them and we've all discussed it a lot. I always give them 24 hours if someone wants to look at the house. My ask is that it is clean and in order, but not that it look spotless. My partner has struggled big time with his boys around cleanliness in general (regardless of me). He doesn't know how to set and/or hold boundaries with them around this. He had said that he thought the house being on the market would help him to hold them more accountable for keeping the house clean.\n\nI now have an offer for the house. The realtor said that one of the reasons why I should take the offer (even though it is low) because the house isn't showing well. The feedback I've now received from both him and someone who cleaned the house professionally are \"unkempt\", \"filthy\", \"disrespected\"...and the litter box has been described as not being taken care of. My partner, his kids, and I have already had one hard conversation about this. I am messy. I'm often a hot mess! But my place is mostly clean. My partner says that he checks the house before it is shown and that it is relatively clean. I guess i'm just not sure what's happening. Hearing about this feedback and seeing how dirty it was the day it was photographed, makes me feel uncared about. \n\nAny insight would be appreciated. What should I do? He is sweet and values helping me and his family. He helps me out all the time with different things, he helps his mom, he helps his uncle, he helps his kids, he actually spends most of his time helping other people. He’s sounding like a complete jerk, but he is someone who is very well liked. \n\n\n\nTLDR My partner and his kids have different standards of cleanliness from me. It's impacting the sale of my house as well as our relationship. What do I do? \n\nHe is paying rent. I could be charging someone else more, but I'm not giving him some amazing deal. I will not be living with his sons. If I try to sell it vacant, I could lose months or more in rent. \n\nUpvote1Downvote1Go to comments  \n",

         "Two friends (28F) visited me (28F) after years and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — how do I fix things or know if it’s time to let go?",
         "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n\nT lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n\nThere were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n\nT also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n\nThe night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n\nAfter she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n\nThere was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.\n\nTo be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.\n\n# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nTwo old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I’m wondering how to fix things — or if I should just move on. How do I handle this?",

         "I (F23) had a breakdown and now I’m scared I’m ruining my relationship with my boyfriend",
         "Hi Reddit. I don’t really post, but I need to vent and maybe get some advice because I feel completely lost right now.\n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost two years. We’ve talked about moving in together soon, and while I’m excited, I’m also nervous. I have anxiety, and it really affects how I process emotions and interact with the world. I overthink *everything*. I also tend to cry a lot when I’m overwhelmed, which makes it hard to communicate clearly and it makes me feel ashamed.\n\nOver the long weekend, I went to visit my boyfriend. He lives one town over. He was playing video games, and I didn’t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead. About 30 minutes later, he came out and (in what felt like an aggressive tone) said:  \n“Can you stop having an attitude?”\n\nThat completely threw me off. I didn’t even realize anything was wrong. When I tried to ask what he meant, I got overwhelmed and started crying as I genuinely didn’t know what I had done. He apologized, but I still felt hurt and confused.\n\nThen, as all this was going on, his parents walked in (they had just come in from out of town), and I had to immediately act like nothing was wrong. Internally, I was falling apart. I ended up crying nonstop sunday and monday.\n\nI eventually left early and went back to my apartment. When I got home, I called him and tried to explain what I was feeling. I said something like: “Hey, I’ve been sitting with a lot from this weekend. I know you’re stressed with work stuff, and I really do get that. I just ended up feeling really shut out, and when things got tense, I didn’t feel emotionally okay staying. I also know I shut down around your parents  I just felt exhausted and didn’t know how to talk about it.\"\n\nHis immediate response was: “I think you need to go back to therapy.”\n\nThat hurt. I know he’s stressed, but I felt dismissed. It made me question everything. Since then, we’ve been distant. I love him a lot, but now I’m wondering… is it over? Did I mess this all up?\n\nTLDR: I (23F) visited my boyfriend (26M) over the weekend. He got upset and told me to “stop having an attitude” when I was just watching TV alone. I got overwhelmed, started crying, and felt really dismissed. His parents walked in mid-breakdown, and I had to pretend I was fine. I left early and tried to calmly explain my feelings later, but he just told me I “need to go back to therapy.” Now we’re distant, and I feel confused, ashamed, and wondering if this relationship is right or if I messed it all up.

         "I [18F] don't know how to tell my [18M] boyfriend that I need him to be more attentive.",
         "TL,DR: I don't think my boyfriend is showing me enough attention and isn't picking up any hints, and I always have to tell him everything in order for him to actually do something for me. How do I bring it up without whining/complaining too much, since we had a pretty similar conversation about the same topic not too long ago?\n\n\n\n\nI have a loving boyfriend. We've been friends for a few years before getting together, and he was so much better than my other friends at the time because we could bond over shared bad/traumatic experiences, but also general taste, opinions, thoughts and so on. \nWe got together 7 months ago, and while we had a few problems here and there, we worked through them as we promised to communicate calmly. However, I may he holding a grudge still and I'm here for opinions and advice.\n\nFor our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all), I made him a nice present and bought him a book - nothing fancy but still personal and I did put in effort. He bought me nothing. He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either, but I was fine with both as I enjoyed his company and I don't really need material things or gifts from him to feel loved, and besides, he already got me nice gifts for our first month together. But then again, is it that difficult to get/make a small thing? Or make/buy a small, spontaneous gift without me always having to ask? He's awkward and somewhat insecure, afraid of making mistakes or \"driving me away\" (despite me repeatedly telling him that I genuinely couldn't care less about what gift he gets me/makes me as long it's not something I openly hate. I love him to death). I told him how I felt hurt about some stuff and needed him to pick up hints and notice behaviours or patterns that I do when I'm, for example, upset (which are very obvious and we've discussed them thoroughly a few times, even before we got together). He apologised and said he'd try and notice more and be there for me in the future, so we soothed that out - or so I thought, I guess.\n\nI've had a urinary infection not too long ago and I've only recently recovered from it, but I got sick a few days ago (a somewhat serious cold but nothing dangerous) which is making me exhausted and irritable. I've been having check-ups and talks with the doctors at least twice a week these past few weeks because of both the urinary infection and now the cold, and not once has he offered on his own to even keep me company. Which I find hurtful.\n\nI understand that he's busy with his school and that maybe he's not in the mood to get out of the house or something, but it still hurts that he doesn't even offer help or to visit me. A few times he just outright forgot or ignored that I'm sick, until I reminded him. He hasn't gotten me anything to eat/drink when I invited him to come over (and only because it was also convenient for him, and he used to get me stuff, especially sweets and food like that before). \nBut whatever, that's fine. But he also seems.. uncaring, or disinterested. Is it really that hard to just reply to my message telling him I'm going to the hospital because I feel like shit and my health isn't improving with more than \"owww, rest up\"? Is saying something like \"I'm busy/tired/whatever today but if I could, I'd keep you company\" really that difficult, even if it's a lie? \nIt's literally the same aforementioned talk about attention and spontaneous acts of kindness (whether physical, verbal, in terms of gifts) that we had. And I'm tired of always asking things of people, especially of him. When he's sick, I make sure to buy him his favourite snacks, to cuddle with him, to offer to take care of him and try to do it should the circumstances allow. But he just doesn't return the favour despite me telling him, more than once, that I'd appreciate such things, even if just an attempt or offer. I don't get why, and if I'm just an asshole or seeking attention. I don't know how to tell him all of this without sounding like I'm whining/complaining too much. How do I tell him, what do I do? How do I communicate properly with him and let him know?\nAny help/advice is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post.\n",

         "On and off relationship for 8 years. Don't know what to do next, advice?",
         "I [22F] and my [M25] boyfriend have been together officially for 7 years. We took a break last year, I broke up with him because I felt as though my needs weren't being met and I felt neglected and like I wasn't important to him. \n\nWe've been seeing each other regularly for the last year but he doesn't want to put a label on anything yet. He's currently in school and his family basically hates me for leaving him for someone else. \n\nFor some background information to better understand, his family is very emotionally unavailable and I came from a very emotional family and have learned its best to talk things out and express emotions and feelings instead of sweeping them under the rug. \n\nHis mother would make fun of me for not knowing basic things in front of their family members and make fun of personal problems I have with sensory things and he would never say anything in my defense after expressing that it hurt my feelings.They would bash my family and judge me if I ever came to them for guidance as I do not stay in contact with my own family anymore and don't have many friends thinking I could come to her as she'd call me the daughter she never had.\n\nOver the years I felt like I did most of the sacrificing in our relationship, driving every weekend to see him after he refused to leave his apartment with his roommates to spend the weekend at my apartment where I lived alone because he didn't have his PC with him or he didn't have his rig. \n\nWe spent a limited amount of time together alone without videogames or getting high, mainly when we'd run errands or be waiting for his friends to get home, from work, or watching tiktoks. When his friends got home I'd basically be sitting around bored for hours and sometimes crying because I felt left out and unwanted. His friend is very disrespectful to women and would subject him to grossly inappropriate content and games where he'd be playing as an unrealistic nude girl with unlimited customization options. \n\nWhen we would be intimate together, he'd always ask me to dress up and basically be something that I'm not, it got to the point where he'd be watching porn while we were doing things and there was a few times that I would cry or break down during it and it was just awful and extremely unhealthy for my already existing insecurities from being body shamed my whole life by my family, I weigh 230lbs and have a nice figure for my weight and height. \n\nI was very verbal through the entirety of our relationship with how he made me feel, making me be something I'm not, never complimenting me after basically asking in every way possible, never emotionally being there for me when I was going through personal and family problems. Sometimes I feel like we're incompatible but I love him very deeply and part of me feels that way because he was my first intimate partner but Im in love with him.\n\nOver they years I discovered his porn addiction and him micro cheating in private chat rooms. I've also found a post on hook up pages on Reddit which he swore he never followed through with in person. His social media algorithms are so personalized that even on Facebook he can't scroll for like two minutes without seeing boobs or something inappropriate. On tiktok is ads for sexy outfits, girls thrist trapping like every 10 to 15 videos. He's now asking about me wearing more specific things which im not entirely comfortable with.. I love him so I want to make him happy but I'm also afraid that I'm disrespecting myself and if I say no he'll find it somewhere else or resort back to chat rooms if he ever stopped that to begin with.. we're not even officially together but we're exclusive according to him, even though he won't tell anyone about us and we aren't living together.. \n\nI've talked to my friends about this many many times over the years and they all say the same thing, that it's not a good match, he isn't treating me the way a boyfriend should, that I deserve better. In my heart I think I  know that but I don't know what I'd do without him. He understands me so well but at the same time not in the ways I need him to understand me. We've talked about doing relationship counseling but even if we do, I'm scared his family will still hate me and be unkind to me and I'm worried that I'll still feel this way. \n\nTl;dr - what to do? Am I in the wrong, should I be more understanding and supportive? Am I allowing myself to be mistreated? Advice ",

         "How did you feel when she said “I love you” first ?",
         "So I(25F)’ve been in a relationship with my partner (25M) for a few weeks. We dated for about two months before making it official, but we’ve known each other for over 8 months (we actually lived together as housemates for 6 of those months).\n\nToday, after he came to see me, I couldn’t hold it in any longer and told him that I love him. He didn’t really react, and now I’m not sure what to think. I did tell him beforehand that he shouldn’t feel pressured to say it back or to say anything at all tho. just wanted him to know how I felt.\n\nStill, I have to admit I was a bit surprised. The morning after he asked me to be his girlfriend, as he was leaving my place, he kissed me and said “love you.” It caught me off guard. I kissed him back and ended up saying it too, kind of instinctively. But since then, I’ve been wondering whether he truly meant it as “I’m in love with you,” or if it was just a casual way of expressing affection.\n\nOver the weekend, after thinking a lot, I realized that I really am in love with him. That led to our conversation today. I first asked him what he meant when he said “love you” that morning, and he said it meant he has “a lot of love” for me. I’m not entirely sure what that means, to be honest.\n\nThen I told him that I was in love with him. He stayed calm, kissed me, smiled—and that was it. No words.\n\nSo now I’m feeling a bit confused. I don’t want him to feel pressured in any way, but I also can’t help wondering if he felt uncomfortable, or if it was just too soon for him. Could I have scared him off? Should I have kept that to myself a little longer? Does that silence mean something?\n\nOr maybe a part of me is just trying to find reassurance from complete strangers on the eventuality that he loves me back but is just not ready to say it.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in this situation—how did you feel when she said “I love you” first?\n\nTL;DR: I (25F) told my boyfriend (27M) I love him after a few weeks of being official (but knowing each other for 8 months). He didn’t say it back, just smiled and kissed me. He once said “love you” before but explained it meant he had “a lot of love” for me. Did I say it too soon? Should I be worried?\n\n",

         "Cutting ties with family member who is hosting an important family function - what should I do?",
         "Throwaway bc I don’t want family to find this. \n\nThere’s a lot of necessary backstory so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n\nA couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n\nFast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n\nWe recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n\nI have decided to explicitly say I can’t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n\nNow the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nTLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can’t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don’t want to be two-faced but also don’t want to cause more family drama and tension. \n\n",

         "\nMy girlfriend (20F) and my parents don’t get along, and now I (20M) feel stuck in the middle\n\nBody:\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend since high school — about 2 years now. We’re both 19 and currently sophomores in college. Things between us have been great, but there’s a serious issue with how she and my family (especially my parents and brother) get along — or rather, don’t get along.\n\nThe latest problem started on Easter. She came over to my parents’ house, brought a gift, dressed nicely, and made conversation during dinner. After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother. They said she rolled her eyes every time he spoke and that she’s done this for years (though I honestly haven’t noticed that). They also said she came off as cold and dismissive toward them.\n\nMy girlfriend was shocked to hear that. From her perspective, she’s always tried to be polite, and she feels like my parents never really liked her and are constantly looking for reasons to dislike her. Because of that, she no longer feels comfortable coming over. She thinks anything she does will be twisted into something negative.\n\nNow my parents are asking for an apology from her. It’s been about a month and she hasn’t apologized, because she doesn’t feel like she did anything wrong. Meanwhile, my parents say they’re losing what little respect they had for her, and it’s clear they don’t want her around until she “makes things right.”\n\nSo now I’m stuck. I love her and want this relationship to work, but I also want peace with my family. I hate this tension, and it’s hard feeling like I have to pick a side. I’ve tried talking to both sides, but neither is budging. I don’t even know what a “solution” looks like anymore.\n\nIf anyone’s been through something like this or has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, but she and my parents don’t get along. After Easter dinner, my parents said she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my brother. She says they’ve never liked her and now refuses to go over. My parents want an apology, she refuses, and I’m stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace. Not sure what to do.\n",

         "I'm starting to think I'm crazy, need honest input about possible cheating",
         "I'm a 40 (f) and my partner 38 (f).\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nMy partner and I together for over 5 years. When we met she told me about an online friendship we had with a man she was interested in. They met online and started talking. He's a \"public figure\" of sorts and asked her to meet up and go for a walk. She never met up with him, but I could tell by the way she told the story that she was very impressed with him and somewhat shocked he wanted to meet up.\n\nFast forward, I know she still has a friendship with this person. She mentions him once in a blue moon (a project he's working on or something like that.) One time, she mentions that he would like to meet me. I find this a bit strange, because I've never had a conversation with him or any connection. I know that while they've had this online relationship, they've never met in person.\n\nFast forward a few months ago, she flies to LA for a work event. I pick her up from the airport and notice she is DMing someone. I notice she's DMing for quite a while. I only read on the screen \"did you get home?\" And I see the name. This person is this man's ex partner. They still coparent and live together (strange I know). I get a very weird feeling in my gut. I'm thinking to myself, did she meet this person and his coparent? I can't get it off my mind, so the next day I ask \"did you see (persons name) when you were in LA?\" Immediately she answers \"yes.\" I ask her where and she says she went to their house and played with their kid. I ask her why she didn't tell me. I am at this point feeling very confused and upset. My ex has social anxiety and drove over 40 minutes to these people's house. It's unlike her.\n\nI start asking her questions, specifically why she wasn't honest about going there. She gets highly defensive. She starts yelling and telling me I'm crazy. Her reaction makes my stomach sink. I tell her something is going on here, and I have never had a feeling like this before. Specifically with this man. The next day, he DM's me and basically tells me that nothing at all happened, and that he doesn't appreciate me making an assumption. I found out my ex told him private parts of our conversation. I feel completely betrayed. And I'm made to look crazy.\n\nA few months ago, I'm going through financial records. I recognize a bunch of charges from 2023-present to this one company. I come to find out this is this man's company. He hosts webinars and you only need to pay a donation fee. I don't want to share the exact amount, but it comes to my attention that my ex has spent over $5,000 going to these webinars and I was not aware. She never told me this. Each charge is around $500 with a few for $1000. Now I'm really feeling betrayed. Especially because our shared funds were paying for his events, and he was outright accusatory towards me. She never once told me she was attending these events, let alone making such large donations. She had filed them with our bookkeeper as \"charity.\"\n\nThis makes me go through her phone records and I see that she is still having a few phone calls with him. Even after I'm upset about her going to his house. I was under the impression that after she violated my boundaries and shared personal information with him, that she didn't speak with him anymore. But she did, after he was rude towards me.\n\nAdvice is much needed and appreciated\n\nTLDR: Partner was caught going to a home of someone she was interested in the past. I know his coparent was there, but it still felt weird because she lied about it. She then told him I suspected something was going on and he (somewhat) told me off on DM. I also came to find out she spent $5,000 over a year and a half on his webinars that she never mentioned to me.",

         "My (30F) boyfriend (40M) doesn’t want to be intimate with me",
         "My boyfriend and I have dated for 7 months. We started out with me pretty avoidant and recently single after dating a sociopath that really screwed me up. Slowly he made me open up and was extremely caring- more caring than anyone I’ve ever been with. \n\nHe understood my slowness and avoidant nature and was patient. Eventually we became physical and we were completely attached at the hip- to the point where he has lived with me since the first time we had sex. We were intimate constantly sometimes 6 times a day and he couldn’t keep his hands off me. Of note, he is also on testosterone and other supplements that increase his libido. \n\nWe started having some arguments and major issues from them. All our issues came out and he was under major stress- a new job, worse pay, injured himself so he couldn’t work out (he was working out daily before that), pressure from his second job, and then there were rumors about him and a coworker who was known to sleep around with married men. I’m the kind of person who wants to talk things out and voice issues and I’m highly emotional and he’s more of the shut down avoid and think about things- he self isolated and blames himself for being “dysfunctional” and states he “can’t feel his feelings because they’re wrong” and it’s always his fault. He says these things not in a passive aggressive way but truly things he’s just not meant to be with someone because of his inner issues. \n\nWhen all of these issues started coming up we he stopped being intimidate with me. It was like it completely ended. In the last two and a half months we have had sex once and I almost felt like I forced him because he had a “I guess I’ll do this” attitude the entire time. \n\nWhen I talked to him about it he says it’s because of our issues and he just isn’t sexually aroused when we have underlining issues going on. Then recently he also said he feels like he doesn’t turn me off. I’ve always had difficultly orgasming and he feels like it’s him. I literally have had one orgasm before that was not caused by me so it’s not like it’s a him thing- which he knows all of this. I also have been more dry lately- I’m not sure why, I’m still attracted to him but I have been on increased antidepressants which have dried my mouth out so maybe that’s a reason? But he said that doesn’t make him feel good either. \n\nI’m having a hard time not feeling unwanted and undesired with all of this. Tonight I tried to put moves on him again and he just didn’t do anything. I cannot have a sexless relationship. Has anyone dealt with this before? How to I navigate this? Do I give him more time as things seem to be getting better in our relationship? \n\nTLDR: fighting has caused my boyfriend not to have sex with me for 2+ months and I’m going insane thinking I’m unwanted and unattractive",

         "Is my partner [20 F] cheating on me [20 F] or am I overreacting?",
         "My partner \\[20 F\\] and I \\[20 F\\] have been dating for about 4 years in total now. We dated for around 2 years at age 16 and broke up due to differences and emotional cheating which she admitted too. We were separated for about 9 months to a year and then have got back together.\n\nThings were going well until a couple of weeks ago, when we were hanging out and i opened her phone to find she had been snapping a guy who I'd never heard her mention before. I knew that nothing would be going on as she let me have free access to her phone, however when I looked at what was actually being said he had sent a a screenshot of a map of how far away his house was from hers. When i asked about it she said she was only going to answer a couple more messages and then block him.\n\nThen I discovered recently that while she was away on a work trip she had been in a guys hotel room, cuddling on his bed and watching TV. This guy I knew was her friend, however in the period that we were broken up he made it clear that he wanted to sleep with my partner. Furthermore, there is another different guy that she works with who she keeps meeting up with one on one to go on night time drives with. This guy has a girlfriend but I feel the distance between us and can't help thinking all of this is playing into it all. \n\nWhat doesn't help is that I go to university in a different city so we already have physical distance. So reddit, is there a chance my partner is cheating on me, or am I reading too far into this?\n\nTL;DR - My girlfriend (both 20F) and I have been together 4 years, with a 9-month breakup due to her emotional cheating. Lately, I found out she was Snapchatting a guy who sent her his location, cuddled with another guy (who once said he wanted to sleep with her) during a work trip, and goes on late-night drives with a male coworker. We're long-distance, and it's making me question if she's cheating or if I'm just overthinking",

         "My (21F) boyfriend's (23M) grandmother recently passed away and I don't know how best to support him",
         "Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.\n\nVery recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. \n\nHe's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like \"I'm alright\" or \"Yeah, thanks for being here\". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.\n\nHis friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. \n\nBut, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?\n\nI know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. \n\nSorry that it came out so long and massive apologies if a lot of it sounded like one, big whine. I just thought it relevant to show why and how I've been feeling helpless alongside some other contexts. I'm also not a big poster so sorry if some things are not right!\n\nTL;DR My long-time boyfriend's grandmother passed away very recently and I've felt useless in being there for him as I'm not sure how to. Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do. ",

         "Do I (18F) cut my friend(18F) off ?",
         "I had a friend group last year. This year I wasn't in their class. I had trouble including myself in convos at lunch but tried making efforts. Once I asked to come to a party and they invented an excuse so i didnt come because they didn't want the friend I was bringing. I let that pass and then they were planning a hang out to the skating rink. I couldnt come but nobody asked me. I told them why I couldnt but they didn't care and I didn't think much of it it wasn't a big deal.\nBut then some days later I learned that one girl was saying that if I came she wouldnt come. I confronted her, and asked my closest friends about it. She told me she was here if I wanted to talk, but didn't it was late at night so she stopped responding. But she never responded to my messages after that. It hurted me but I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward last month I learned that I wasn't invited to a big hang out because I distanced myself too much and the mean girl said that if I was coming she wouldn't come again even though i thought she would stop after talking to her about it. I talked to my closest friend, she told me to get over it (wasn't mean saying it) but I tried to communicate to understand but she would disregard a lot a my messages. About the thing the girl said she said that she couldnt ask me to hang out because some people didnt want me there, but admitted that i was progressively excluded from hang outs. Also, i asked why she wasnt telling me what was happening, she told me that i already knew everything and that i knew more than her about the story. Didn't have the chance to talk more about the subject as she wanted to stop talking about it. I thought that maybe I didn't communicate enough beforehand but I just found out texts from just a few days after learning all about the first exclusion where I complained about being excluded and that nobody was doing anything about it. My closest friend saw it but never responded. It really makes me want to just stop talking to her as we already don't talk much. But she is also the only one in the group to do efforts for my bd and stated multiple times that she didn't us to drift apart.\n \nMoreover, she complained multiples times last year that she didn't feel included in the group and I always reassured her and at least asked if she was coming to some hang outs\n \nI feel like im becoming crazy as the only mean girl in the group was the one I talked about in the beginning. My friend was a nice person so I can't help but thinking I might do a mistake cutting her of but I can't help but ressent her now\n(Sorry for my bad English)\nTL;DR : mean girl excludes me and my closest friend in the group does nothing about it.",

      "Body text: My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n",

      "I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times.

      "Body text: For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?\n",

I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n",

Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people.

      "Title: Two friends (28F) visited me (28F) after years and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — how do I fix things or know if it’s time to let go?\n",
      "Body text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n",
      "\n",
      "T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n",

      "I (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n",
      "\n",
      "We recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n",

I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n",

After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother.

      "My partner and I together for over 5 years. When we met she told me about an online friendship we had with a man she was interested in. They met online and started talking. He's a \"public figure\" of sorts and asked her to meet up and go for a walk. She never met up with him, but I could tell by the way she told the story that she was very impressed with him and somewhat shocked he wanted to meet up.\n",

I know that while they've had this online relationship, they've never met in person.\n",

      "Fast forward a few months ago, she flies to LA for a work event. I pick her up from the airport and notice she is DMing someone. I notice she's DMing for quite a while. I only read on the screen \"did you get home?\" And I see the name. This person is this man's ex partner. They still coparent and live together (strange I know). I get a very weird feeling in my gut. I'm thinking to myself, did she meet this person and his coparent? I can't get it off my mind, so the next day I ask \"did you see (persons name) when you were in LA?\" Immediately she answers \"yes.\" I ask her where and she says she went to their house and played with their kid. I ask her why she didn't tell me. I am at this point feeling very confused and upset. My ex has social anxiety and drove over 40 minutes to these people's house. It's unlike her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I start asking her questions, specifically why she wasn't honest about going there. She gets highly defensive. She starts yelling and telling me I'm crazy. Her reaction makes my stomach sink. I tell her something is going on here, and I have never had a feeling like this before. Specifically with this man. The next day, he DM's me and basically tells me that nothing at all happened, and that he doesn't appreciate me making an assumption. I found out my ex told him private parts of our conversation. I feel completely betrayed. And I'm made to look crazy.\n",

He hosts webinars and you only need to pay a donation fee. I don't want to share the exact amount, but it comes to my attention that my ex has spent over $5,000 going to these webinars and I was not aware. She never told me this. Each charge is around $500 with a few for $1000. Now I'm really feeling betrayed. Especially because our shared funds were paying for his events, and he was outright accusatory towards me. She never once told me she was attending these events, let alone making such large donations. She had filed them with our bookkeeper as \"charity.\"\n",

I’m the kind of person who wants to talk things out and voice issues and I’m highly emotional and he’s more of the shut down avoid and think about things- he self isolated and blames himself for being “dysfunctional” and states he “can’t feel his feelings because they’re wrong” and it’s always his fault.

      "Body text: Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. \n",
      "\n",
      "He's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like \"I'm alright\" or \"Yeah, thanks for being here\". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.\n",
      "\n",
      "His friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. \n",
      "\n",
      "But, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?\n",

      "I know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. \n",

Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do. \n",

After she had told me she didn’t feel she could sustain a healthy relationship, communication dipped and I wasn’t able to see her for weeks at a time. When I did finally meet her for lunch one day a little over a month ago, she explained her situation to me, and how she didn’t foresee things getting better for her for at least a year once she was done with school. She had apparently understood that to be a breakup talk, and I wasn’t aware that’s what it was. I thought that if I held out a little longer, eventually we’d be able to reconnect and start spending more time together again. When we met next a few weeks later, something felt wrong.

      "\n",
      "During that time, I developed a severe eating disorder and became a shell of a human being, so the next two years from 2022 - 2024 felt like another blur. He was incredibly supportive through my recovery, and I’ll always be grateful for that, which is why I feel so incredibly guilty for how I’ve been feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the things that are nagging at me:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Physical intimacy**: Somewhere around the 3 year mark, I stopped wanting physical contact. This coincided with my eating disorder (which can cause that) so I brushed it off. But even after full recovery, any sort of prolonged touch makes me uncomfortable. I started to wonder whether I might just be fully asexual, but going out and talking to people made me realize I *can* feel attraction…it’s just not happening with him. I want to stress that I have not met anyone else; it’s more that these interactions made me feel *interesting* again, something I haven’t felt in a while. I fully understand that this is normal in long-term relationships, but I can't help but wonder what it's like to be physically attracted to someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Feeling disconnected**: He’s so kind and supportive, but every conversation either feels really shallow or one-sided. We have banter and it’s *fun,* but when we talk about anything serious I feel like I’m talking *at* him, not *with* him. This is also the reason why we don’t fight - he rarely contributes to the conversation. and when I repeat something later, it’s always like he’s hearing it for the first time, which makes me feel unheard. If I ask him to express his thoughts he will literally just tell me he has none, which brings me to the next point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. How passive he is**: The biggest issue came when he quit his job after years of resenting it. I’m proud of him for choosing happiness, but he has never once spoken up about the unfair workloads. Not once. He just let the resentment build up and took it all in until he couldn’t anymore. This is a pattern: he will get upset but won’t voice his feelings or act, even after I’ve asked/encouraged/begged him to. It feels like he’s stuck in a cycle he won’t break, and I worry it’ll continue in a new job.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is something that extends outside of work. Once, a stranger shoved me hard, and he did nothing. He didn’t say a word. And when I wanted to address it, he held me back. I understand wanting to avoid confrontation/trouble, but it really bothered me that he made it seem like a me problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, someone took our paid seats at the theatre, and he suggested we just sit elsewhere. I handled it and got the seats back, but it was frustrating. I’m fully capable of standing up for myself, but I want a partner I know I can rely on to step up too, if that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I think about the future, I panic that I can’t count on him to make decisions or advocate for me, or us as a unit. This makes me feel so guilty because he’s technically done nothing “wrong,” and I love him like family. He’s still the same kind and thoughtful person, and seeing him feels like being at home. But I’m scared I’m outgrowing him, and I don’t know what to do.\n",

      "Body text: I (23M) have been together with my girlfriend (23F) for a little over a year now. Like any other relationships we have our own ups and downs but overall it’s been great, at least for me. Ever since the start of 2025, I always had this feeling of she’s just using me for money or to do things for her. I don’t mind spending money on her or helping her with tasks but over the 1 year+ I don’t feel like she would have done the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple weeks ago I asked her a hypothetical question, “if I suddenly go broke/bankrupt would you still be with me?” Her answer seemed logical at first but I still felt a little hurt. She said “well if that happens I’ll probably stay for maybe 3 months to see if you’ll get more money again, if you don’t then I’ll probably leave”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another incident happened 2 weeks ago where she went out for dinner with this guy “A” and 2 other male friends. I don’t have anything against her seeing other old male friends as long as it isn’t 1 on 1. To provide more context, my girlfriend used to have a thing for “A” and she told me about it before. At first when she told me about this dinner I was uncomfortable and I told her about it. But she insisted on going and hesitantly invited me to go to “make me feel better”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the day of the dinner, she only told me the general location of the restaurant and told me to wait for them. I had ot that day as work was really hectic so I arrived 10 mins late. I texted her when I arrived and asked her where should I meet them or which restaurant do I go into and waited. 30 minutes passed and still no response, I tried calling her and she never picked up. About 15 minutes later only she texted me the exact location of the place and told me to come to the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was already pissed for waiting so long after what seemed to be a chaotic day at the office. Right after we sat down, I noticed “A” wasn’t here yet but I didn’t ask any questions. 10 minutes had passed and her phone vibrated, I could see that it’s “A” texting her that he’s here. She darted to go out of the restaurant to bring him in. I was very deeply hurt. In my head it was just this thought that “wow she is okay with letting me wait for almost an hour but she sprinted out to get “A”?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, throughout our relationship she has never once suggested activities or even showed the need/want to hangout. It was always me planning a trip, planning a date or even going out for food. Overtime I was getting more and more anxious and jealous and insecure of myself to the point where I would want to know where is she and who is she with.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have this app called “life360” which tracks each other’s phones and we can know each other’s location in case of emergencies. We always get notifications when we leave our house and I always update her beforehand where I’m going and who’s going to be there so that she doesn’t feel worried or anxious. But she rarely updates me and barely texts me about who she’s seeing or where she’s going.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve talked about this with her before and she always dismisses it by saying “why’re you like this? You were never like this before?” Or empty promises to update me more often. I’m not sure what to do or what to feel anymore. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.\n",

For context there was situations in the beginning of the relationship where she told me she wanted me to get pregnant 5 months into our relationship so she could have a grandchild already. I told my boyfriend this made me uncomfortable and her told her to stop and the next time we were alone she told me “you don’t have to tell your boyfriends everything you know.” And after this I just kept my guard up.

      "My boyfriend and I (23F, 24M) have been together for over 3.5 years—starting with a long-distance relationship and now living together in Australia for 1.5 years. We haven’t spent a single day apart in that time, and we’ve built a safe, loving life together. I want to visit my family and friends in India for 3 weeks, but he can’t come due to work and finances. While he understands why I need to go, he’s emotionally struggling with the idea of being alone at home. I feel really guilty and heavy about leaving him, even though we plan to stay connected. I’m looking for advice on how to better handle these emotions and this situation.\n",

My partner cannot make it with me because of his work and financial commitments - he really does want to but that would a callous decision considering his responsibilities. We are both upset about me leaving for a short time, but he is a bit more affected by this change because he would be alone at home, in a space that he's always shared with me. He said he understands why I need to go but there's this beautiful and vulnerable side to him which is asking me to stay back.\n",

He would cry, I would cry (much more) and all would be well. It’s very toxic but I love him very much and I do think he loves me too but now I’m questioning it. The last few weeks we had some pretty big arguments where he would say hurtful things like: “I don’t want you” and more like this. I’ve became insecure again and would check his social media (I would never check his chats just is he followed someone new or if he’d be looking up girls. Please don’t come after me, he broke my trust a few times and he gave me this willingly to reassure me and it did help so I haven’t checked in a long time until today). \n",

      "So today we called and he really wanted to play a game with me for days but I had some problems installing this game so it took a few days before we got to it. Today was the day but unfortunately his wifi didn’t work and he got pissed and said he would go sleep. I asked him if we couldn’t spend a bit more time on call instead because we haven’t played the game at all due to his connectivity issues and we only called briefly. I already feel a bit insecure lately due to his statements and the arguments and whereas before he would love to call every day, lately through the fights we didn’t call as much anymore. So when I asked he blatantly told me no to which I replied that I understand he is upset he couldn’t play the game due to his wifi as he was looking forward for days to playing this game with me, why would he not want to spend time with me playing a different game because we haven’t called that much (and we had a big argument only two weeks ago lasting more than a week where we didn’t call so I missed him). He literally hung me up midsentence. He had done this before and I find this very disrespectful. I tried calling him many times as this got me upset because he could just wish me goodnight and not try to push his frustrations with his wifi unto me? It’s like he just wanted to play that game but not really spend time with me for that matter. He seemed almost annoyed with calling while earlier this day he called me very happy and was just his old self (yesterday we had another small argument..).  He literally scolded me, said some words, was very hard towards me.. while I only asked why he hung me up like that.\n",

But also said: muchos love ❤️\n",

      "But alas, the reason of my post is the following: I saw an earlier message thread between him and an old classmate.

He said it so flirty too. Am I going crazy? This was a month after the emotional cheating occurred and three months into the relationship…  I sent him many angry texts at this hour but he’s still asleep so I have no clue what the next steps are. Do I just block him? Is this platonic? Would a guy in a relationship send this to a female friend? She never even responded to it.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone, I (16F) need some help understanding what’s going on with my friend group and how to proceed with a group invite I sent. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context, I enrolled in a completely new high school my freshman year along with several other members of my grade. Making friends in this completely new, small private high school was tough.  The beginning of this year, (my third year of HS), I \"switched\" into a new friend group with one of my close friends (let's call this friend X) -- meaning I started hanging around and eating lunch with a new group of people who matched my interests more closely and I felt more comfortable around compared to my earlier group. At first it was extremely tough socially and  rocky, given that my grade is quite cliquey and also smaller. I also had no classes with anyone in the group besides Friend X and Friend Y, so the only times I really got to interact with the group was during lunch. Thankfully, I switched with Friend X so we always had each other to lean on if the group planned things without us/were not very inclusive. I also got really close to another girl who is part of the group but towards the \"outside\" of it (let's call this Friend Y). Recently, however, I started building closer bonds with people one-on-one, and things have started to feel better. Obviously there were still times where you could tell the core members of the group wanted to do something by themselves (ex they would go off somewhere in school/hang out and not ask Friend X, Friend Y, and me too, and in that case Friend X and I who switched would just leave the group and do our own thing rather than following along and seeming clingy.  Prom is where things seemed to get better. I was invited to get ready with the group before and also sleepover with the group after prom, and I genuinely had a great time. After prom, I felt closer with the group overall, even though there were frequently still moments of not feeling completely included-- but in that case Friend X and I had each other. Since then, I've felt more included, though Friend X, Friend Y,  and I are still on the outside of the group -- with the core members doing their own thing/making plans by themselves. I think the other core members of the group do see  Friend X and I as their friends, because they do talk to us/hang out with us in school. But again, when the other core members of the group are present, they tend to become more exclusive. \n",
      "\n",
      "The core members of the group also comment on my posts frequently, and we are friends in person. Some lunches I'll talk a bit less than other lunches depending on what our conversations are about, but I feel like that's normal. Anyways, to celebrate the end of the school year, I decided to invite the whole group over to my house. I sent the invite two days ago in our group chat. Out of about 7 people, only Friend X and Friend Y responded.  The rest—people I’ve been talking and laughing with in person and feeling way more connected to  just a day/week before—haven’t said a word and are completely silent. I understand that maybe the core members are waiting to see who else is going to say yes before committing, but I still feel a little hurt that I genuinely thought I had built closer connections with these people, yet no one besides two people have responded. For prom, a similar thing happened where no one responded until around 8 hours after the first invite was sent, only after a core member responded. And I honestly relate to not responding immediately because I remember thinking \"oh maybe I should wait and not be the first to respond, otherwise I'll seem too clingy.\" So maybe that's the same case for this invite, but it's also been two days later, not a couple of hours??\n",
      "\n",
      "The message I sent was very low-key, but I’m wondering if I came off as clingy or if I misread how close we really are. But I also feel like basic decency would be to at least respond, even if it’s a “maybe” or “I’ll check!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to maintain these friendships and I do like the people in the group, even though they can be exclusive at times. I'm also very non-confrontational and given my place in the group, would definitely not want to start any conflict.  But now I'm just starting to question whether inviting people was a mistake on my part and if they're angry about it/what silence means?\n",
      "\n",
      "How should I approach this without seeming bitter or confrontational? I was thinking of doing a follow up message at the end of this week with something like \"Hey! No pressure if you can't make it or have other plans, but so I can get a rough headcount, can you let me know if you're planning on coming?\" \n",

A good while later, me and her started talking, and you know, we instantly connected, and to this day we have a loving and meaningful relationship. I love my girlfriend so much, and I know that she loves me too. I have no doubt of that. She has reassured me a lot that she is not in love with this boy, not more than just how she still loves him as a friend because of the friendship that they once shared, and respects and admires him as a person. She does find him attractive, but assures me that is also in a shallow way, and nothing to worry about, he is just objectively her type. (This is normal for me and my girlfriend, I don't care if she finds other people attractive because I think that's natural and we've talked about it, I only care about what she chooses to do with the attraction, and I know she wouldn't cheat on me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, my girlfriend has this boy in her mind so much. At one point in our relationship while we were having a pretty rough spot, she was dreaming about having sex with him (intense dreams, so she says) almost every night for a week, I believe? I forgave her for this because she obviously felt guilty for it, assured me that she doesn't actually want to have sex with him, and what she dreams about is not her fault or something that she can choose. It's been a while since that. She stopped having sex dreams about him. After the sex dreams, though, she started just dreaming about him in other contexts. (I think I believe her that she isn't having any more sex dreams about him, me and my girlfriend are truthful with each other about that kind of thing usually, and I really don't see what reason she would have to hide that from me.) But anyways, now she is having dreams of them just hanging out, spending time together, connecting. I know he's her childhood best friend and obviously they had a strong connection, but is it normal to dream almost every night about someone you used to be in love with while you're in a relationship? I don't know, I just feel kind of weird, does that make sense or am I being over-concerned? I don't even necessarily feel insecure or like I'm not good enough for her I don't think, I'm just confused and interested as to why her subconscious is dreaming about this guy SO. MUCH. Also, they don't talk regularly anymore at all, more than replying to each others stories every now and then. Most of the time when my girlfriend does interact with him, she makes a huge deal out of it and talks about it so much and looks into every little way that he speaks to her. This might sound wild and like, oh okay she's obviously into him, but if you knew my girlfriend you would know that she is honestly like that with everyone and incredibly observant, and she loves people so much, and building deep connections with them. Maybe she is not quite as worried about how other people are responding to her as to the extents that she is with him, but I have a hard time believing that's for any weird reason, because she assures me with that as well that she just finds him interesting and still has a connection with him from childhood. I think the way she interacts with him and her reactions to what he says is pretty normal for her and she's not disrespecting me or crossing my boundaries in any way, but I can't help but just keep thinking about this!\n",
      "\n",
      "She dreams about him considerably more than she dreams about me, I almost can't remember the last night she didn't dream about him, she said that she wrote a poem about him, but that she doesn't want to share it with me because she thinks she should keep me and that part of her life separate. What does that even mean? I don't know what she wrote a poem about. I'm sure it was abstract, and not a straightforward love poem or something. My girlfriend is very spiritual and she said she believes this boy might be kind of like a \"twin flame,\" and that they are interconnected throughout this life, and not meant to be together. Almost like their connection is so intense that they can't pursue it. (I don't remember her exact words.) All in all, I can't really get any kind of clarification or reassurance from her because she doesn't know what this pull toward him means either. I guess I shouldn't be caring or thinking about it that much because I don't think it really affects our personal relationship that much and I trust her that she's not going to cheat on me or something, and maybe it's because I'm young and this is my first serious relationship so I just don't have the maturity to understand that it's not that deep, but I just feel confused. Does this make sense? Any intel, thoughts, questions? I just genuinely don't know if this is normal or not and am trying to understand better.\n",

      "TL;DR: My girlfriend has a dream about her childhood best friend she was in love with almost every night even though she doesn't have regular contact with him anymore and swears she's not in love with him, but that they do have an intense connection and she feels a pull toward him. I don't know how to feel about it or if I'm being immature for feeling a little weird.\n",

      "Body text: I need help with myself but want to start off the right foot with all the info; I have been married to my 31F wife for a few years now but have been with her since secondary school. We had already gone through several relationships (my longest was a 2 year gf in middle school) before meeting each other in a class we had together and via friends who eventually sparked us to have our first real and fun conversation with each other by sharing experiences we had with connected friends, interests and creating plans to hang out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am older than her just by a couple of months and was her very first sexual experience while I have already had a few before meeting her. Since meeting, we have had a beautiful and very awesome life together I cannot compare to any relationship I've ever had. We had our rocky moments, especially in the beginning as teens still developing, learning about ourselves and learning to shed off certain people not good for us. There especially were people in the past who would feel to need to try and interject into our lives, many times from social media, when they had no idea of the collection of compromises we've already done for each other with certain agreed boundaries or to justify a decision one of us needed to make such as with ex's who would try to get us to hang out solo or to split up, even after secondary school. \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan was to have being a husband become a habit that was practiced over time and eventually a lifestyle I embodied without much thought. There is a study and saying out that repeating something for 21 days makes it a habit. The problem is that it's been way longer than that and I've noticed since being married, my relationship skills, want to hang with other people, and jealousy when she is out for long nights with her friends till past 1am while I'm getting home in the evening from work inevitably gets to me mentally, if she's okay or if another person in the social circle starts becoming of bad influence, even affecting my sleep on early work days. I assume it is because my whole life growing up and developing that I was okay, used to, and it was normal in society and around my friends to look at other girls and have attraction, just like how you look at something you really want or crave and will do whatever creativity or it takes to have. Flirting and dating was always novel and made me feel excited, but it also took up a lot of time away from things like homework and solidifying other meaningful connections. Parallel to the problem I have is no matter how long it has been, I still have that attraction towards other women that for some reason pains me internally if I let them walk away and never practice banter or never try and see what kind of cool and attractive person they are to share fun experiences with in life and in the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I've never had a dad to show me the ropes of how/why to be a good husband or how to flirt and show the opposite sex a great time time. I've had a babysitter most of my life growing up so most of my learning in that realm came from friends and observations. Maybe because I've never had a solid relationship to look up to that I feel permanently damaged to love loyalty the right way and long term without lying in how much I am attracted towards the oppose sex. I am worried it may not get better, only worse, and will cause me to regret years of life I could have been active in feeling the rush from the opposite sex and experiences I've prevented when my partner was going to do it down the line anyway. It would also suck big time if later down the years my wife screws me over in anyway, financial for example, and all of my progress in mental loyalty and years with one person ends up breaking from trust over a quick fling anyway, which would make it feel unfair and hard to rebuild trust again since I've been working towards developing a loyal way of living all of these years in a unique marriage I've committed myself into.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I'm just looking for advice and/or reassurance that it will get better. Maybe there is a valuable resource that has helped you or someone you know? It would be best if the anecdote is very relatable and applicable, such as you've been married for a long time too, or else it feels similar to me trying to get weightlifting advice from someone who is not an experienced trainer themselves but instead only reads about it, hears and watches videos of it. Similar to being book smart but not street smart, I want to apply some advice as soon as possible for the sake of my mental health because it drives me crazy and makes me beat myself up; am I a bad person and should just succumb to what feels natural because I cannot change my brain to be a loyal husband mentally; having the constant battle to resist checking out an attractive woman and be attracted to the chase and fun of flirting? Or is there light at the end of the tunnel with wisdom, a mentality and as a great loyal husband that I've seemed to see in other friends loving dads that I've met in the past.\n",

      "A lot of these thoughts also came recently after reading comments and hearing about the scandals Justin Bieber has been in, like kissing SZAs hand on stage while he's married, which caused me to reflect a lot on my emotions and mental health between what is the right thing and what is right for me. Like I've said, I love my relationship and they all take work, but that old habit of flirting and dating still follows me and eats me, almost like another person who desires that separate life. Also I am not sure if it is just coincidence with age, COVID, interests, etc or being married itself,  but before marriage, I had a lot more friends and was very social and would attend way more gatherings. Now it's a combination of lack of interest and inevitable awkwardness that prevents me from hanging out with past friends and attending gatherings. It hurts more because I'm a very empathetic person who cares a lot about peoples goals and feelings, but maybe don't understand how to show it well or express it in the way they want it reciprocated. It may have been natural without though before when I was still social, but I especially hate the thought now of just sitting around at a party or gathering just shooting the shit. Majority of the time it's people complaining about work or drama. I like hearing about plans, ideas, goals and aspirations no one around ever seems to be willing to spend hours talking about and planning, not even my own wife who I've tried and tried but never sticks. Most people around me just want to drink, go to a bar late after work or watch a show. I am also worried that one day things will start changing, like habits and genuine connections, right when I leave because that has happened with a lot of things in my life. At the same time, I had also had many older people when I was still in grade school tell me to never get married because of an experience they had or money. \n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I are very different from what most relationships I've seen in that we have already experienced a lot together most couples do not so young, such as moving into an apartment so early and levels of honesty I don't see in other relationships around but so that we understand each other better and where we are coming from. With that said, I've already expressed to her my battle between being the husband I want to be and wanting to flirt with other women. Watching youtube videos only does so much help but does not change the actual thought and hormone energies in the heat of the moments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe that is where I need a coach instead of a trainer, to constantly be there for me 24/7 like a rod keeping my tree growing straight up or a set of braces. At the same time, I am not sure of all of the help will still get me back here to square one even after years from now to where I was better off being single, giving her a chance to meet a husband who perhaps is more biologically capable in the head to be loyal and in his actions, and to where I can date while still young, developing my career, and settle with someone when I am much much older who may or may not have best interests (you hear about partners taking out life insurance policies especially all the time in the first few seasons of Forensic Files), or if my wife is still single and willing to make it work years later if my brain calms down. The problem I idk if it ever will, if this is normal in all men that have the desire stronger than others, and if early influence is a big factor that has already screwed me up to be a great loyal husband such as what you hear about with abuse victims tending to pick abusive spouses that were just like their fathers or abusive exes. \n",
      "\n",
      "After so many talks, she is not willing to make splitting or taking a break even the thought of an option which I fully respect since half of me wants that too. Half of me doesn't though because I feel guilty that I am not the husband she deserves and am holding her back from someone that may possibly do a better job at loving her and giving her the life she wants than I can. She doesn't want that and shows more empathy than I feel that I possess. However, I did read a statistic recently that people who have had more sexual partners in the past tend to be less satisfied with their spouses in the future and bedroom. I've reflected on that in my marriage with me having a few sex partners before my wife who, in contrast, saved me to be her first which I find very respectable, unique and hear is hard to do or find now often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years I have sought professional help, paid and free, as well as advice from much older and experienced people but here I still am. I think this mental battle is also affecting my way of connecting with people at work, my family relationships and my identity again. I assume because I'm not willing to explain a lot or know how to during the heat of situations that never feels right or some people do not understand, so they end up chalking me up as a weirdo and do not want to hang after work. One coworker made a recent comment on how married men turn boring eventually and are not very social. Many times I do not want to hang or cancel last minute because I worry I won't relate to them, in fear of awkward collection of moments that has happened and damaged possibilities of future hang-outs, interpretations and how they judge me. The truth is, people are very judgy even if they say they are not and tend to gossip to people you would never have expected or wanted, just like that old study of how men tend to be confirmable gossiping to strangers while women tend to gossip with social circles. Only I and possibly my wife really know why the way I am now, but at the same time, I still don't know who I am and what I can, will and want to become as a husband, person and possible future father that can teach those around me and ahead of me the right way to be, act, think and do..\n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;Dr: I am having a hard time finding the right mindset or advice, or even something simple as a thing you tell yourself, that makes being a great husband easier and that eliminates tendencies both mentally and physically towards the opposite sex after being single and in that frame of mind for most of my life. I feel it has not gotten easier or have had the right support and an always surrounded by other men who seem happier solo or have had men tell me in the past not to get married. Now here I am asking how other successful relationships do it so that I know what to try and apply into my to so that I am that great husband since I see my relationship as very special. What do you do in yours? Does it really get better? Or are you happiest single after a long committed relationship?\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR - Matched with a guy on Bumble a year ago. We stayed in touch long-distance and finally met when I visited his city. It felt comfortable and natural, and we got emotionally and physically close. He said he missed me, wanted to visit, and made me feel special—but by the third week, his energy completely shifted. After three days of silence, I asked what was up and he said he wasn’t “feeling the romantic connection” anymore. He still wanted to be friends, but after some space, I reached out and the vibe had clearly changed. He’s still sweet to me, tries to listen to me if I have thoughts going on  I recently told him I’m done with long-distance friendships that have emotional history and don’t want confusion in my life. I’m emotionally exhausted—not because it ended, but because I cared and it never got a real chance to grow.\n",

      "I (F) matched with this guy (M) on Bumble a year ago. We lived in different cities but stayed in touch consistently—called, flirted, shared reels—for nearly a year. We kept trying to meet, but something always came up. Finally, I visited his city, and we met. It didn’t feel like a first meeting—there was comfort, laughter, ease. We ended up seeing each other every single day while I was there. He took me around the city, made me feel special, emotionally safe, and admitted he was a virgin but felt ready with me. We got close—emotionally and physically. He’d say things like “I miss you,” “I’ll come visit soon,” and talked about how sweet our bond was. Looking back, it did feel like a bit of love bombing. He said he’d try to visit before the month ended—just needed to figure out logistics since he lives with family (understandable). The only red flag I felt was when whenever he was out with his friends, he would just shut off and not talk to which he said he likes to pay attention to whoever he is with (fair and understandable) but it never felt like he would not text me back until we had met but maybe because now he wanted to explore this connection, he would rather talk when he can give me attention?. I didn’t overthink it. Things felt good—until they didn’t. By the third week, his energy shifted. No more daily texts, no reels, no check-ins. I mirrored it at first, but after three days of silence, I finally asked what’s going on. He replied: “I’m not feeling it.” He said I was more invested, didn’t want to lead me on, and didn’t feel the spark. He still wanted to be friends though. But during the conversation, he also compared me to his ex—how she used to act, how he didn’t like that—and even though he didn’t mean harm, it felt hurtful. I wasn’t her. I was showing up with a clean slate, ready to see where this could go and imo, you need to explore a connection for a while, go on more dates in person and not shut it off completely because you didnt feel that instant spark. We agreed to take a week of space and if he wanted to remain friends, he’d reach out. I told him if he didn’t, I’d move on. But a few days in, I missed him. We were friends before we even considered dating. So I reached out and called. He said he assumed we weren’t going to talk for the full week and that he was actually planning to text me that day. Miscommunication, fine. He is still being sweet and is listening to me if I have anything to say but it feels like he’s moved on—he’s active and distracted. Meanwhile, I work long days, have no social circle in my city (thanks COVID), and I’m stuck processing everything alone. Eventually, I texted him clearly and told him I’m done with long-distance friendships, especially with people I’ve had history with. I said the connection feels confusing, I don’t want that energy in my life, and that I’d only be open to reconnecting if he ever moves to or visits my city again. Otherwise, it’s closed. I feel emotionally drained. I don’t know if I was breadcrumbed or just got too close to someone emotionally unavailable. It hurts, not because it ended, but because I cared—and it feels like I never got a real chance.\n",

He said he had shared things about his mental health that he didn't want me to read, and that's all.

When I opened his photos I saw screenshots of of texts he had with his ex-gf--he immediately grabbed the phone and deleted them even though they were fairly innocuous.

We grew up together and had a relationship for three years before I broke up with him because he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me, not that he ever treated me bad but he was just immature I think and also wasn’t very honest about how he felt or about things in general. Flash forward 5 years later and we have now been talking for 8 months. To my surprise I actually really like him and think he’s incredibly funny. He treats me so well that the first time I ever saw him he gifted me a really expensive thing telling me how he remembered I wanted it. He does really nice things for me, I have never needed to lift a finger around him, he plans trips, he tells me how much I mean to him, takes me shopping, never complains, etc. I also have yet to catch him in a lie but I have trauma from catching him in the past in lies so I don’t even look at his phone or anything anymore nor do I want to. Anyways even with this new leaf he’s turned I don’t know how I feel. \n",

For background I struggle with commiting to anyone and I think this is from a lack of a loving home in my childhood. I experienced a bit of trauma growing up so I don’t love like a normal person would. I don’t really like affection. Not that I can’t show it but I just struggle with it.

      "background: me and my current boyfriend started dating his junior year and my senior year of high school. previous to that we were good friends. i had been dating one of his friends my sophomore year until beginning of senior year until i broke it off because the things we wanted in life were completely different and i didn’t see it working out in the future. i began dating my current boyfriend (ill call him will) in april of my senior year. even before we started dating, his parents and my ex’s parents were good friends and when they realized i was with will, they began to dislike me. at first, it was just his mom. she would tell him things saying that i was not a good person for dating his friend and then him (which i know could come off as wrong but there was no unfaithfulness while dating my ex), and saying that she doesn’t want him dating me. he stood up to her in the beginning until she started taking some drastic measures and at one point even came to me and begged me to stop being with her son. we broke up a couple times due to him not wanting to upset his parents but always got back together because we still loved each other. there was one time where they found out we were sexually active and his parents threatened to tell my parents everything that i had done and what has been going on. there was also another time where i had went to his house to just pick him up to grab some food, and his sister came up to me and basically told me i was immature and she had “gone through something similar and knew that we wouldn’t work out” as well as yelling and crying telling me to leave will. i left and let him deal with his sister but during that time it mentally impacted me heavily so i just decided to distance myself to not see his family at all. \n",

      "**TL;DR** his sister currently also has a boyfriend who is the same race as me so i know it’s not a race thing, and they treat him so well. they invite him to dinners, take him on family trips, and whatnot. i’m currently a upcoming sophomore in college and he is about to graduate. we did long distance for a year and made it through. my boyfriend and i’s relationship is great, we have no problems and plan on staying together and potentially moving in together in college (if his parents allow). it just bothers me because even though he’s about to leave for college, his parents still try to control how much time he spends with me or even how late he stays out (sometimes telling him to come home at like 10pm when he has nothing else to do the next day). his mom in my eyes has been manipulating him as she’ll make subtle “jokes” to try to get him to go home and at one point before we started dating, would cry to him about being depressed because he was going against what she told him to do. i’ve been dealing with it up until now, but in my eyes, he’s about to head off to college and his mom is still trying to control how much time he spends with me. i’m also planning on transferring to the same college he is going to (not solely for him but for my major) and it’s just frustrating. he doesn’t want to always do what his mom says but he will sometimes cave when it comes to his mom controlling when he’s out with me. i don’t want his family to continue disliking me but i also don’t know how to especially get his mom to change her opinion about me, so im not sure what to do at this point. are there any tips i can do?\n",

I was the one who broke the silence by saying “so what do you want talk about” he goes and “says I don’t know. I have nothing to say and I don’t know what you were expecting me to say”. I said “your the one who called me saying u wanted to talk and said I wouldn’t cry in the cafe” which by the way I did. then he goes and says “well if I’m being honest I forgot I even rang you”. I was so crushed and mad I said to him “just take me home”. then another 2 weeks pass, he starts texting me more asking how am I and stuff. which i thought was weird, so being polite I say “how are you doing?” he says “I’m stressed” I say “is it because of work?” and he says “everything”, but because I was still angry I replied “well if ur stressed about us it’s ur own fault” then he goes on to being like “I know I’m sorry. I’m so stupid. I lied when I said I forgot out ringing you to go get coffee and I don’t know why I did” and everything, so out of sympathy I said “do you want to talk?” he said yes, but things have happened which I’m not going go into, but it’s delayed our “talk” and now he’s gone back to ignoring my messages and I feel like he’s Change his mind again and I just don’t know what do. why is he messing me about like this?\n",

      "\n",
      " one example of this is a very big fight we had over me accusing him of being insecure. the source of it was us taking an IQ test together. i got 120 and he got 100, he said he wanted to retake it as he was tired. he then got 110 and said that it was more accurate. me, being a bit of a know it all, went 'well not really because taking the same test again is basically guaranteed to give you a better score' and we argued back and forth like 'well it doesnt tell me which answers are incorrect' and 'but you can assume based on the score you got, if you get a second chance at the questions of course you'll get a better score'. it was very petty and maybe in relationships i need to learn to just not say what i'm thinking because ultimately there's a lot more emotional weight on what i say. similarly, we fight over video games a lot because i trash-talk in the same way i would with my friends but this upsets my partner. i do try watch what i say but it's difficult for me to gauge what is upsetting and what isn't. example: us playing against bots and i go oh huh that's weird oh it's probably because you're a lower rank and then we argue because he yells at me for being a fucking asshole and then i get upset because he yelled at me and you can fill in the rest. i understand that is something i definitely need to work on but it is the root of some of our fights so that explains a part of it.\n",

      "For a little back story, we were dance partners and would train together 2-3 times a week for almost a year. During that time, he started bringing me small gifts and I would ask him to walk me to my car after training for safety. That led to him fixing numerous small things on my car and even a couple significant fixes over time, all of which was his idea. On occasion he would give me larger gifts, and even a really thoughtful one on Valentine’s Day. We would regularly talk in the phone, normally for 1-3 hours but also small things here and there. He was always there for me in times of need. We would do random things outside of training. And then we would train things that required close proximity. We were basically committed to only training with each other, so we both put a lot of time and effort into that. I actually think I was his closest person, since he was literally always available for me and worked his plans around mine. Even on short notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of everything, he asked me on a road trip to something he knew I would enjoy, which didn’t end up happening because I cut things off. Now, if we were dance partners and none of the others things outside of training occurred, I wouldn’t have thought anything if it. But I started to get feelings for him. I would drop little hints or openings, like asking him if he gets all his friends thoughtful gifts in Valentine’s Day. He would flirt and I would flirt back, but we never kissed or anything like that. I did eventually address it, and told him how I was feeling and he said he didn’t feel the same way. I was crushed, but accepted it, and said we couldn’t be partners anymore. I didn’t explain it why but I knew I couldn’t handle it. He also never pushed.\n",

      "What I’m confused about is- why would someone put in that much effort into another person they don’t see romantically? Like, any of the things on their own would seem friendly but all of it combined seemed like too much effort for someone just trying to be friends. I’m also feeling hurt because, after all the time we spent together, he hasn’t said anything to me since. Didn’t even try to show care for us continuing to dance together. From what I can tell, he hasn’t been, and I have continued training with other people.\n",

      "Edit: I want to mention I had a good feeling I was going to be rejected. But ignoring my feelings for that long made them start to bubble up in unhealthy ways. I’m sad to lose a good friend in my life, and perhaps if I was a stronger person I could’ve handled the rejection and continued to work together. It really blows to not have a dance partner again. I just felt like I couldn’t really face him after that.\n",

      "They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to.

And the truth is, if it were as simple as her just being sensitive and taking things to heart, I could absolutely deal with that.

I don’t brush it off or minimize her feelings, but I don’t take it personally when she raises her voice when speaking to me or says intentionally hurtful things.

So this has led to her giving me the ultimatum last week that, since you can expect it to take months to sell a house, if I don’t put my house up for sell, it’s over. I bought this house in 2019 at a 4% interest rate, nearly half of today’s rates, and looking at things objectively, this would be the worst financial decision I’ve ever made. But, there was a time where I would be willing to make that sacrifice to make her happy. I think that the things that I’ve seen over the last few months may have eroded that. \n",

      "Body text: Apologies for the long post but here it is. Husband (M31) and I (F27) have been married for 2 years. I moved to his country and made a massive transition to be with him. He didn’t do a lot of work on his mental health over the past 2 years and recently trickle truthed me about some bad decisions he had been making for the past year that we had discussed when marrying and agreed would be cheating behavior. He lied and hid it and he never felt guilty until a month ago.\n",

      "Last weekend while addressing the idea of future children, he voiced to me that he's worried that if we had children they may grow up:\n",
      "A. Wanting tattoos and piercings because I have them and he really dislikes this possibility as he dislikes my tattoos and piercings and anyone having them who isn’t someone he’s just sexualizing in the moment like a fantasy\n",
      "B. Feeling bad about themselves because I get Botox and plan to get a breast augmentation and he dislikes the idea of them making aesthetic changes inspired by what I look like\n",

      "\n",
      "He himself struggles with physical and mental health conditions but he did not voice any worry about them growing up to inherit any of conditions that he experiences and instead only voiced worry about scenarios where they may be negativity affected because of how I look or how open-minded I am towards aesthetic expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past he has also voiced displeasure about my tattoos and piercings and made passive-aggressive “jokes” about removing them and outright stated he doesn’t feel attracted to those things or want them in a wife. Mind you, I had 5 tattoos and several piercings when we met and have been respectful about not getting any big tattoos since but upon voicing how I want to get more, he called them horrible and his expression and body language seemed disgusted. If I had known our difference in values then, when he should have but didn’t voice them, I wouldn’t have continued the relationship but here we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "My issue isn’t how he feels but how he is voicing it and his only focus being on how my physical appearance might harm theoretical future children despite me being a lovely person who takes pride in personal growth with full faith that I would do an amazing job raising children while considering I’ve never done it so I can only assume. I feel he is blaming me for things that haven’t happened and would not be fair to blame on me if they did. I can recognize that there can be a domino affect on those we love from our choices but blaming me for those outcomes would be unfair.\n",

But I didn’t know how to tell you bc i felt like that was a part in why liked me. I only had 45 days to take the nclex and obviously now it’s past that. So I have to take another semester in the fall that’s only 6 weeks and then I’m finally all set. But all the work stories I’ve told you are true and I’m a nurse tech for now. I’m sorry. I think I was too ashamed to just be out of school and when I fell in love with you I didn’t know how to tell you because I know it would change everything.

He asked again and I said I don't know, he left the room after that and has been quiet/not talking all evening until he went to bed.

      "* He is a tremendous father to our kids.  Loves kids, spends hours each week with each kid hanging out or helping them troubleshoot emotional, social, etc. issues. He's spent time coaching their sports teams. I send a lot of the kid issues to him nowadays because he's usually more patient and insightful with them.\n",
      "* He's a good earner.  We have a good home in a good neighborhood and school district.  It's not enough that we don't have to be responsible, but it's enough that we don't have to worry (\\~$250k/yr).\n",

      "* His hygiene is poor.  He works from home 40-50 hrs/week, so he only showers when he needs to leave the house, which is a few times per week.  His brushing isn't great either. He often forgets deodorant and he stinks up our room.  We're both obese, but we're both working on it.\n",
      "* He has porn-induced ED.  He masturbates almost every day, mostly with softcore pics and stories.  He gave up hardcore stuff years back.  But his masturbation isn't anything like intercourse, and when it's time for us to be intimate, he can't stay hard and often takes 30+ minutes to finish.  We have sex every couple months (mostly when I initiate, he says he's afraid to), and the sex is nice. But we haven't had intercourse in 9+ years.\n",
      "* He doesn't do much, if any housework.  He has his own physical/injury issues that limit him. But he just doesn't see it or take any ownership of it.  I'm so tired of doing all of it.\n",
      "* I'm constantly disappointed by how thoughtless he is about me.  He says he can't read my mind, but it just feels like he doesn't care or think about me hardly at all. I feel lonely.\n",

This time I didn't even bother responding to what he said and just nodded, gave him a thumbs up and we continued on about our day. But he couldn't let it go.

      "Body text: Hi there! My (29F) boyfriend (29M) have been together for about 2 years. We moved in together 6 months ago (into the house that my boyfriend owns) and I thought things were going relatively well. We don't tend to have any real communication snags, which now makes perfect sense. Apparently my boyfriend has been bottling up his frustration/resentment about the cleanliness of the house and decided to unleash all of it on me today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional background: my boyfriend I'm being honest, is a bit of a slob. I knew this about him when I met him and it didn't bother me because many, many people close to me in my family and otherwise are also slobs. Running around like a little gremlin and cleaning the occasional tornados people leave behind is truly just part of being in a functional household to me. Nothing ever gets too messy, and if it does, you all pitch in and clean it together. I would consider myself a relatively organized/routine person, but very laid back. As you can imagine, I had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about our cleaning styles and our expectations for living together so we wouldn't have the very issue we're having now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house is MUCH cleaner than it was when my boyfriend was living here by himself but, according to him, I'm not doing enough. He spent over an hour telling me about all of the little things I'm not doing correctly (i.e. sometimes I'll forget to move an empty soda can into the recycling bin before I go to sleep for the night, or I'll do all the dishes and forget to clean the pot that's on the stove) and how it frustrates him and stresses him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I can be more mindful, but the truth is that all of these things he was so upset with me about were minor mistakes/slip ups that people just make from time to time. (I clean every day, and any room we use on a regular basis is maintained on a schedule that I keep). His accusations also seemed kind of hypocritical because he does almost no cleaning. Like borderline zero. I told him he can pitch in and help, to which he said he does and that's why he's so frustrated and exhausted. (Reddit, I'm not crazy. I know there can be a misperception of what you're doing vs. what someone else is doing to keep things clean, but I am 100% confident that I am doing 90% of the cleaning -- which I don't mind! I agreed to do a lot of cleaning because I enjoy it more!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The other issue is that there are projects that my boyfriend will start up and not finish and I guess he's been expecting me to clean those as well? (He did not communicate this to me until now, and I guess maybe it's on me for not asking, but I try to respect his space by not messing with the projects he has going).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I'm on Reddit because my boyfriend is genuinely fuming about this. I think this is honestly the most angry I've ever seen him. But I don't understand what to do. I don't want to be walking around on eggshells, worrying about every little thing, when that's not how he treats the house at all. Yeah, sure, it gets a little messy over the course of the day (can you take a guess why), but then it just...gets cleaned. I know he has ADHD, and that also makes organization and cleanliness tough, but this situation just seems really unfair to me. I really do keep the place tidy and clean up after myself, but things are constantly accumulating throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything that I've written that points to an issue/attitude/communication problem I have that needs to be adjusted? How can I create a working system where we both live and clean comfortably in a way that leaves both of us feeling happy? It's almost like my boyfriend has decided he wants everything perfectly organized but isn't willing to put in the work to make it that way. I love our house, and I love being here with him, and I'm just heartbroken to learn he's been so secretly unhappy all these months.\n",

      "Body text: We've been together for the past 5 years - married for 3. Nearly half of our entire relationship she hasn't worked. I've had numerous talks with her about this issue because she has finished Law school and seems to not want to work in that direction. Fine, okay. That's her prerogative and choice. However, when we sit down and review the budget and I explain to her that we currently have no financial difficulties for everyday life needs but we cannot save any money or go on even cheap vacations and this is putting a strain on me - she suggests we make her a resume so we can start searching for a job for her.\n",

      "Where the issue lies, however, is that she doesn't want to sit down with me and write this. She esentially wants me to do this by myself. She says she has never made one and she can't do it alone. My problem is she has never even tried making one before giving up. This sounds very much like weaponized incompetence to me and I told her so. Our arguments lead to nowhere but bitterness after a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all came to a head when we were together with the in-laws yesterday. She was explaining an argument we had prior to the gathering.  The argument was about some tiles that needed to be picked up as they were going to be laid for our new apartment. The shop had told me the tiles were to be delivered at 5pm on Friday. After talking with my wife I told her I wish to do this pick-up on Monday as I was dead tired to pick up some tiles alone that weren't going to be put until Monday anyway. She didn't accept that and her argument was that I didn't ask for her opinion on the matter. My reply was curt and rude - I told her that no matter her opinion on the matter I wasn't going to do it. This all spiraled and lead to the night in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the gathering with the in-laws my wife was explaining all of this. My wife's sister upon hearing the story said I wasn't in the right and that I had no right to speak like that to her. This lead to a full-blown argument where I said that we have no children and my wife isn't working. All I want from her is some leeway on these issues as I feel overtired working alone. She has no driver's license by choice so whenever she has stuff to do I go pick her up and we do it. I have a great job working with my father so I do this during working hours when I'm free, as well. This has put some further resentment from me as she can do these stuff alone but she doesn't want to. She says that I only think about myself and my needs and not hers, whenever I express I don't want to do this every time. BUT IM SO FUCKING TIRED. The stress of having to work for 2 people in these times is making my head spin. Upon hearing my displeasement with my wife on this issue her sister went feral. Told me she can't believe the words coming out of my mouth and then went on a rant about me telling me if I had such a problem with my wife not working I should just find her a job and make her resume myself. Otherwise, I cannot complain. My wife stood in agreement during all of this. Standing there and being scolded by these people while my wife stood in agreement about not working was making me see red beyond imagination. The irony in all of this is that my wife's sister isn't currently working and her husband is having mental problems having to cope with working a lot and not having enough rest for him.\n",

I was 25 turned 26 years old. I was a teacher. This was insanity to me. A few weeks of this passed, being stalked and followed by my dad. I fled. I parked in my local town and cried. The police parked beside me and asked if everything was OK. I burst out crying and explained, I was being harassed and followed by my dad. Within minutes of this conversation, guess who parked beside us. My dad. The policeman went between me and my dad, asking me if he had any mental health issues. My dad then exclaimed the car I was driving was his. The police advised me due to the safety concerns that I get everything I need out of the car and get into their car, give daddy my car and it can be sorted at a later date. Looking back, I still can't believe I willingly packed my car belongings up and left the car to him. It took weeks but eventually I got my car back with the help of the police and I moved in with my partner. That was only the start of the torment. My dad rang my place of work, he told everyone he came across that I was a drug user ( that was his way of covering why I actually left my family home) I has to justify myself to people that I was not a drug user. I was a teacher. And a very good one st that who had never taken drugs. He also said horrible nasty things about my partner. It was awful. This went on for a few years. Since then I have had a child. My parents first grandchild. My mum (f60) is doting on my child (f1) but my dad has tried multiple times to ban my mum from helping me or my child, from seeing us. For months, I had to meet my mum in my car and her car, away from the town so she could see her grandchild. Recently, ee both decided, enough is enough so I took my child to her grandparents home. My mum was overjoyed but my dad will not even look at my child. He has said he will not have anything to do with her. He wants to basically pretend she doesn't exist. He is now suffering with heart failure. My mum wishes he could see sense but I have honestly got to the point, I don't care. I don't care if he misses out on his only grandchilds life. In fact, he doesn't deserve even a chance really. He has done nothing but cause me hassle stress hurt cost me money, taken things from me (oh yes I forgot to say , he dumped all my childhood keepsakes, clothes, school work, any gifts that were brought to then for my daughter etc or anything I had left with my mum e.g. pram add ons etc he dumped them all, he filled a car trailer with it all and dumped it). \n",

      "Body text: For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?\n",

And don’t get me wrong I enjoy cooking for her but when I have tonsillitis and literally can barely move out of bed, why am I the one cooking HER nuggets? \n",

      "\n",

      "Anything sexual we do together she’s incredibly selfish, I love giving head to my partner and I’ve been told many times I’m good at it, I take pride in the fact I can pleasure my partner, however she’ll typically want head or to be fingered, and then immediately after refuse to do anything for me.

It doesn’t even have to be that multiple times I’ve simply asked her a question and she snapped at me so bad I just went quite out of shock.

      "\n",
      "I 'F35' met my boyfriend 'M40' on Reddit at the end of 2020. I had gotten out of a bad long-term relationship a couple of months before, and talking to men on Reddit felt like a nice, easy way to dip my toe in the water without expecting it to be more. I assumed we’d chat a little, it’d be something to do during the pandemic, and it’d fizzle out in a couple of weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it didn’t fizzle out. And I ended up moving to NYC in 2021 for work from the Midwest, and he was in Boston. It took a long time to pull the trigger, but we met for the first time in 2022. We were long-distance for a year, traveling between the two cities. I was working a new job that is fully remote, and I offered to move to Boston to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told anyone who would listen that New York was never my end game. But I did love it deeply. I honestly felt like the city belonged to me. I had an incredible group of friends, I was having the best time, and I just felt so alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite visiting a number of times before moving... it didn’t take long for me to realize that Boston just wasn’t it for me. Everywhere I looked, there was a comparison to New York, with New York coming out on top every time. I moved in September, and by April, I was really miserable and told my partner I hated it here. My attempts at making friends, which I hadn’t been worried about at all, came up short. I live too far out in Cambridge for public transportation to feel easy. My once-per-hour bus or 30-minute walk to the train just didn’t cut it. I missed Broadway shows. I missed having access to every type of food imaginable, everything a world-class city offers. I could go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in April of last year, I shared how unhappy I was with my partner. He asked me for one more year in Cambridge so that he could meet the 3-year requirement for his 401k to vest. I agreed without hesitation- it was a super fair compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outwardly, you probably wouldn’t know that I hate it here. The best part of Boston is getting *out* of Boston, so basically every weekend, we get out of the city... we visit coastal towns, we go to the cape, we go hiking... and I never complain. I can enjoy all those things and it still not be \\*enough\\*, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "I think, for me, if Boston were cheaper, I’d be more content here, but I hate paying New York prices for so much less than New York has to offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March, we started talking about what would happen at the end of our lease, and I reaffirmed that I wanted to go back to New York and that he had agreed a year ago to go with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many pieces and intricacies. So many nuances and so much grey area. It’ll never be black and white. You need to know that he’s a widower and that he has years of memories with his late wife in Boston. You need to know that (though never diagnosed), he is likely a little neurodivergent and struggles with change and has social anxiety. You need to know that he works a hybrid position and isn’t sure they’d allow him to go remote. You also need ot know that I make enough money to support us both should he be let go.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to me, we made a deal. He disagrees. But to me, not going to New York is going back on his word. To me, staying in Boston signifies that I'll be the one bending for the rest of our lives. That he couldn’t just try it for me. That’s all I’m asking. That he tries. And if he tried and hated it, we would find somewhere else, and we’d make that decision together. But at least try.... \n",
      "\n",
      "And he’s not willing to try. He said he can’t leave, and I know it’s related to the memories he holds. I obviously don’t know how it FEELS, but I CAN understand and empathize with how gut-wrenching it would be to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him that I couldn’t stay. I want to go back, and I’ve begged him to come with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sitting here in tears, truly not knowing what to do. A few days ago, it felt clear as day... I have to go back, I have to put myself first. But I love him so much. The way we got to know each other all those years ago... there was no expectation of it ever being more, so we were our pure, unfiltered selves. And I don’t think anyone has ever known me the way that he knows me. And I don’t want to lose him.\n",

      "Body text: Me and my girlfriend have been together for a bit over two years. This starts with me complaining about my mum to my girlfriend. The average \"my mums always telling to do this, my mums always telling me to do that, etc\", the typical complaining about a mum you'd expect from someone my age and that led my girlfriend to not like my mum so much. Now my mum does social work as her job so she's picked up on small behaviours my girlfriend has shown that she didn't like (locking me and my mum in her car once however I saw that as just a habit, leaving me to do all the cleaning after I've cooked for her, things like that) so it's led my mum not to like my girlfriend too much either. Now my girlfriend really disliking my mum reached its peak when my mum asked her to leave my house after she was at my place uninvited while my mum wasn't home (she asked me to tell her to leave once she got home.) now my girlfriend drove off and then I complained about my mum and apologised to her that she had to leave but then my girlfriend drives back to my house enraged then as my mum is outside watering plants out the front of my house she has a go at her asking if they can go inside and talk (in which my mum says no). They have a very heated argument while I just stand there and watch in shock because I've never seen anything like it (while the neighbours watch). Then my girlfriend goes to drive off she yells at the top of her lungs \"if you continue to live here, I can't be with you anymore.\"\n",

      "I have nowhere else to go, I can't move in with my dad because I don't have enough money to pay for rent at his place and frankly I don't want to (he lives in a shared home and would have to give up his bed for me, I don't want him to do that.) Now she has apologised a lot for her actions but the damage has been done. Everytime I close my eyes all I see and hear is her yelling at me and I have nightmares about her every night. And now that my family hates my girlfriend for having a go at my mum in broad daylight, I now feel like I'm in a situation where I have to choose either my family or my girlfriend and I want to choose my family. Our relationship has never been ideal really as I've had to cut off pretty much every female I've ever had contact with to stop her from overthinking, she doesn't help herself when it comes to her mental health issues but we managed to make it work due to me being willing to sacrifice a lot.

      "Body text: My boyfriend [26M] and I [25F] have been together for 3 and a half years. We are both from California and met in college. We moved together during his last semester. That’s when I also started working in my field. It’s a healthcare related career. After our lease ended and he graduated, he had a job lined up in Texas. I decided to live with my parents and he decided to move and take the job in Texas. I understand that he had to do what is best for him. We wanted to maintain our relationship. I continued working in California and living with my parents, though it started to become difficult for us to do long distance. I decided to move to Texas to be with him. I found a new job out there and started grad school too. My program was a year and a half and it is coming to an end. I initially thought moving to Texas may make him consider if he wanted to be with me long term or not. Before moving, I made it very clear of what I want for my future in a relationship and my reasons for moving out there. He knew I want to be engaged sooner rather than later, especially moving for our relationship. He agreed and we seemed to be on the same page. \n",
      "Fast forward to today, we are not engaged/ at the point in our relationship that I had hoped/ want us to be. I’m about to graduate, but I want to pursue my career in California rather than Texas. For my field, California has better opportunities and I would need a license in each state I practice in. Getting a license in CA would be a long/difficult process if I stay in TX. My boyfriend wants to stay in TX for at least another year for his job’s vesting period before looking for a new job. He is open to moving back to CA after that. He had told me he will propose within the next year and that I should trust him. I was sad and upset that he still never proposed to me after all this time. A part of me doesn’t know for sure if he will actually purpose in the timeframe he mentioned. I’m contemplating moving back to California to focus on myself and give him more to think about what he wants. Or should I stay in TX and get the license for my career here in hopes that he will propose soon and in hopes that we will eventually move back to California?\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been in love with my guy best friend for 8 years. For context, we both met in high school at 15. When I first entered high school, I was socially awkward. I had been in the same school with the same kids, had the same friends all my life, and I truly didn’t know how to speak to new people, and specially I had great trouble accepting them. I spent a whole semester depressed, I felt like I didn’t fit in with these new classmates, I didn’t even like them because they were so different from what I was used to that to me, they were like a whole different species. I had an awful time trying to adapt until he joined my class. I don’t exactly remember how, my memory from that time is a little foggy, but we connected instantly. Ever since we became friends, I started opening up to the rest, started enjoying my time at school, he became my best friend and I loved him a lot, to me he was my savior. At 17 I realized I was in love with him, and my emotional stability depended entirely on him. I had really low self-esteem, I was an anxious mess. He ended up noticing my feelings, and kindly friendzoned me LOL. We remained friends, and have been for 8 years till this day. He moved to another city for college, I grew up, matured, my self-steem grew exponentially through the years. Problem is, after all this time, I feel like I still have some kind of emocional attachment to him and I can’t get rid of it, and its gotten worse ever since he move back to the city this year. I’ve liked other guys, but I always end up back to loving him. I’m an objectively beautiful girl, I’m fun, I’m loyal, we get along like no one else, but he still won’t see me as something more than his best friend. I truly don’t know why he has never considered me as an option, and I know it’s not healthy to be constantly getting my hopes up, only to crash to the ground over and over again. Every time I feel like we are getting closer, it ends up being only on my mind apparently, it has happened too many times it’s embarrassing. I’m not delutional, I know that at this point, if he’s never had feelings for me, he never will, but my stupid self always finds a reason to hope. Don’t tell me that I deserve better, he is a great man, it’s not his fault he doesn’t love me. It’s me, I’m the problem, I just want to stop feeling this way.\n",

I know it’s been a long time, but we got together at 16 and lots of things have happened in the time in-between. Even though he asked me to marry him 7 years ago, and besides the fact we had a child and COVID and other things affected how long it took, I also was not mentally ready to get married. But I decided last year that 2025 would be the year. \n",

      "So I attempted to tell my family that I would like to do a wedding this years couple months back. For further context, my older sister is pregnant with her second child and younger sister is graduating HS- so i understand my family has stuff going on. I did not want a big crazy wedding, just a reception with my friends and family- I planned to keep it under 75 people. I was told “can we just do it next year?”. This really angered me, especially since my older sister got married last year and she basically had the whole year about her. So my fiance and I decided, maybe it was us being spiteful, that we don’t want to do much of anything- just do a very simple ceremony with very very close family and a couple friends and then go on a nice trip for a long weekend. I had also realized that after my sisters wedding last year, it was all too much for me.

It just doesn’t seem like anyone cares and it honestly hurts me. \n",

She’s great one-on-one, we have fun together and have supported each other through our roughest times. But when she gets around large groups, I cannot stand her. She’ll very obviously flirt with men and then be shocked when they start to like her. She blatantly flirted with my ex in front of me (not because she likes him but because his attention was on me and she would do anything for it to be on herself) but she’ll do these things in a strategically subtle way where if someone points it out they’ll look the crazy one. \n",

At dinner, she decided to spill the news about the breakup to the rest of the group, and spent basically the whole dinner talking in detail about the story. I left feeling really unappreciated but didn’t say anything because I wanted to be there for her. Last week was another one of my friends’ birthday and we went to dinner. She had been apartment hunting for a while and recently found a suitable apartment to move into. Again, she told me this earlier in the day and she showed me the virtual tour and talked in detail about the location, looked at it on Google earth, etc. But then at dinner, she decided to drop the news that she found a new apartment to the group and everyone asked to see it and she ended up giving everyone the virtual tour again on her phone, until we got our food which was about 45 mins. Meanwhile it seemed like no one was paying any attention to the birthday girl. I tried diverting the topic to ask the birthday girl something and my friend always found a way to bring the conversation back herself.

Most recently (reason I'm making this post), I had a bad episode after theirs, and they started screaming at me and grabbing me hard, telling me to help/hold them over and over. I was having such a bad panic attack that I kept just repeating the same thing over and over.

I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n",

Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people.

I communicated with both parents that I'm thinking about joining for the visit, but the boundary problems are a concern. Also, that I may only come back to visit once/year due to the lack of progress in addressing the concerns. I was clear with both that my goal is to protect the relationship.

      "When we first got together, he was so loving. He told me I was everything. People around me said I’d hit the jackpot. I believed them. But slowly, things began to shift, and I didn’t even notice how much I was changing to survive being around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what I’ve been going through:\n",
      "\t•\tHe started criticizing how I talk, how I sit, how I look at him, how I even blink sometimes. He says I look “attacking” without saying anything. That my tone is disrespectful even when I’m just trying to explain.\n",
      "\t•\tHe constantly says I don’t have manners, that I’m not cultured, or that I don’t come from a good enough background. He even once gave me an old-fashioned etiquette book and suggested I “start from the basics” and stop wasting time on my interests.\n",
      "\t•\tHe makes me feel like I’m always failing. He doesn’t say it outright, but the way he acts, it’s like he truly believes I’m beneath him. It’s not even manipulative at this point—it feels like he’s just disgusted by who I am.\n",
      "\t•\tHe often says I can’t be a part of a “real family” like his. That I wouldn’t last in his home. That I was raised wrong and that’s why I behave the way I do. These aren’t heat-of-the-moment things. He says them like facts. And after a while, I’ve started believing it.\n",
      "\t•\tIf I bring up how I feel, he says I’m being too emotional, or that I’m playing the victim. If I say nothing, I’m giving attitude. If I ask a question, I’m challenging him. It’s like no matter what I do, I’m wrong.\n",
      "\t•\tHe blocks me whenever we argue. He shuts me out, disappears, and then waits for me to chase him, apologize, and fix it. And I always do. I can’t help myself. It’s like I’m addicted to proving to him that I’m not what he says I am.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’s extremely close to his mother, and I’ve always been made to feel like I’m competing with her. If I try to speak up about how I feel about that dynamic, I’m told I’m disrespecting his family. Meanwhile, I’ve felt guilty for even wanting time with my own parents.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’s never once apologized for anything, even when he’s been cruel. He once punched a mirror during a fight and said it was “because of me.” When I get upset, he mocks me or just tells me I need to calm down. I feel like my emotions are used against me every time.\n",
      "\t•\tThere have been times he’s gotten in my face, raised his voice, said things I still hear in my head days later. Things like how I need to learn my place, or that I shouldn’t speak unless I know how to. Even when I cry, he acts like I’m putting on a show.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’ll be loving again, and just when I think things are okay, he’ll find something small to fight about and say it’s over again. It’s like he breaks up with me every time I forget to keep my head down.\n",
      "\t•\tI’ve tried to leave more times than I can count. I’ve lasted a few hours, maybe a day. Then I’m right back—texting him, apologizing, trying to calm him down. I hate that I do it. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m addicted to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m scared that I’ll be stuck in this cycle forever. That I’ll never be able to leave for good. And I’m so mentally worn out. I’m an only child. I would never do anything to hurt myself, but this has affected me so much that I’ve had some really dark thoughts. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.\n",

      "Body text: I met my girlfriend rock climbing. We became climbing partners and over time grew really close to one another. When we met, she had just gone through a breakup that she clearly wasn’t over. While I thought she was cute, I didn’t want to be a rebound. After about 6 months of climbing together and growing closer, we both caught feelings and started dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "We became exclusive not long after and it’s been a few months since. She’s great, charming, affectionate, super caring and has become one of my closest friends. It’s going really well, and sex life is great. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I’m a little concerned. She’s been getting to know some other men. Some of whom I know and am cool with. Some of whom I am only slight acquaintances with and some don’t know at all. One of which goes to our gym. I think just before the time we started dating, she gave him her number right in front of me (framing it as a new friendship and possible person to outdoor climb with—I’m not big on going outdoors but she is). \n",
      "\n",
      "Didn’t think much of it at first. But she often mentions him and other men at random times, even when we aren’t around them. Things like “I almost feel obligated to climb outside with X since he’s so strong”. Or “oh him and I text all the time, he invites me out all the time”. Though she’d never accept the invitations, she also seemed very excited by him. She also talks about her ex a lot, who I don’t think she’s quite over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve bottled in some discomfort, but X recently approached us while we were climbing. He asked her to go outside (not me). She got super excited. Granted, she asked if I wanted to come along, but would have gone otherwise. I said yes in the moment. So we have plans to now.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I tried to explain my discomfort to her. Telling her that it’s likely he invites her out and constantly texts her because he’s interested to some extent. She’s telling me she’s just making new climbing friends, but that they talk all the time and finds their conversations hysterical. I asked if he knew we were dating, to which she said she figured so because we see each other at the gym, but she’s never straight up told him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Immaturely, I started talking about a girl friend of mine more often and I asked how if she’d feel fine if I was always texting other women and being invited out by them. She responded that she wouldn’t care and wouldn’t care if I dated someone else honestly. Which stung. But also felt like her hiding her true feelings of caring. Couldn’t tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first started dating she’d always tell me about how guys only want her for sex or dating (she’s gorgeous) and that she is uncomfortable getting to know guys frequently because of this. But she’s getting to know quite a few recently (again, some of which I know and are cool with which is whatever), and doesn’t seem to be concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "It never feels like she brings them up maliciously, moreso naively/subconsciously and I don’t even think she realizes she’s doing it. But sometimes feels subconsciously like she wants me to be concerned, whether I have a reason to be or not. Like with one of the guys I know and am not concerned about, she talks about him often too and even said he has a nice ass. Again, she’d never date him, and I’m not worried about him, but it feels like she wants me to be? If that makes sense.\n",

      "Yesterday, my bf of two years dropped a bomb on me: he feels like he was not so ready for a committed relationship (he is 25M and barely experienced life like different partners, travel, diff jobs etc) when I'm 28F and I have traveled for 8 years and had quite a few relationships, situationships, you name it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both know that what we have is rare and great but lately, Bf has been slipping into a more depressive state due to work and responsibilities. When I met him, he was doing season work and living at his parents, and I took him traveling, and we moved together into an apartment in another city. This adulting was quite new for him and I knew back then that eventually he would feel like it was a lot or he was missing out on his twenties. However, he always assured me that he loved me more than anything and would follow me anywhere.\n",

      "The last couple weeks, he has been distant with me. He usually takes care incredible care of me and is very onto me, and I am the one more independent. His new job got him new friends, which Im so happy about and smh I felt like our lives were more balanced (we live in my hometown so I have a lot of friends and family around but he did not). I went for a weekend trip with friends that he knows very well but he could not come due to work on saturday. I let him know about my endeavours as usual, and he went out with his work friends. During the evening, I felt weird - his messages were scarce which is not like him at all. I felt insecure for the first time in almost two years, but I buried the feeling and said nothing, because there was no rational reason to freak out.\n",

      "\n",
      "\\-I feel like roomates lately and our routine is too much to handle, I feel flat\n",

      "\n",
      "NB: he is very loyal and respectful, so he did not act on it. Just feeling that crush already drove him crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I told him that if our life was too serious, we could kick it and do something else - I KNEW his age when getting with him and his background, and I always told him I was ok doing something else. But he struggles to tell me what he wants, he only talks about what he does not want and I don't want him resenting me because I always decide so I am waiting on him deciding something. (I am happy with my life now though).\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And for the crush, even though it hurt bad, I admitted that I had some crushes too. The thing is, it's easy to crush on the next new thing. Usually its sparkles in your eyes and then something makes you understand they're not compatible with you. My little crushes would always go away in a couple weeks naturally, because what I have with bf is so much bigger, stronger, more beautiful and I love him so much. Being slightly attracted to someone else cannot shake that for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised by my revelation and took it in for a while, understanding where I was coming from. He offered to change jobs to get distance with her to which I said, if you like your job, don't do.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then spent the entire evening crying, consoling each other. He would say things like 'if we separate for a little while, then we will find each other better'. He misses missing me and I understand that. We also talked about how when he goes out, he feels the need to come home to me early and feels frusrtated. And I was actually mad at this one because we are party people and I never put pressure on him in that regard. He says he does not want me to be alone home but I said im fine with me-time (im a geek too so i usually use the time to play). I feel like he puts a lot of unrealistic expectations on himself, he has this idealistic idea of love and what a couple is so for him getting a crush was shattering. I am from a different background so I am more open to listening and understanding that this things happen, you can't control it but what defines you is how you act on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have barely slept and I'm sick, trying to give him some space this day but even through the few messages we sent, I can feel he is distancing himself lots.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided for now to keep going on and reflect on a solution or things to put in place in the upcoming months and reconvene this conversation next weekend. We don't want to rush and yesterday was madly emotional. But I don't know what to do: give him space, accept the break? I feel too anxious and rejected to be initiating much but maybe I should push myself? I am so very lost and every thing he does that is not his usual caring self hurts me deep. He was crying so much yesterday, saying he felt like an asshole and that he loved me still and would see a future with me but that he felt like it was all a lot now (which he never mentioned before).

We’ve only had sex 2-3 times in the last 12 months, and I feel like I’m losing my sense of masculinity and connection with her. I’ve tried talking about it, but nothing changes. I’m starting to feel unappreciated and have found myself flirting with coworkers for validation. What should I do?\n",

      "\n",
      "We’ve never been an overly intimate couple. For the first 18 months, our sex life was fairly regular and we were both happy. Then, before our second anniversary, I went through some personal family issues that led to a mental health struggle. I lost a lot of confidence and, for the next six months, we didn’t have sex once. I wasn’t too bothered about it because my low sex drive was largely due to my mental health at the time.\n",

      "Fast forward to this year, and I’ve made a lot of progress. My mental health is better, and my sex drive is back. But for the past six months, nothing has changed between us. When I try to kiss her on the lips, she swerves me physically, and I feel rejected. This makes it feel impossible for me to imitate anything further, and it feels like she’s not attracted to me anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most couples, we have our own little language and pet names, that are very juvenile and cute, but it is so frequently used from her that it seems impossible to make anything sexual. Her compliments to me are only ever that I am cute in this same voice intonation and style. Its emasculating. These compliments are nice in moderation but are quite unrelenting, and I’m missing that deeper physical connection, a sense of intimacy. It feels like I’m more of a cuddle buddy than a boyfriend. We’ve had sex once this year. I think that’s ridiculous, and I don’t know how to handle it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I brought these issues up with her, she told me that she just doesn’t have a high sex drive, and that it’s a personal issue she needs to work on. But nothing has changed, and I’m still feeling neglected. I’ve started noticing other people more and flirting with coworkers. They flirt back, and it makes me feel better about myself. I know this isn’t healthy or appropriate behaviour, but frankly it is relieving to know I can still be seen sexually by someone.\n",

      "I truely love her but I’m struggling. I’m not having my physical needs met, and my confidence feels shot. I’ve communicated how much this is affecting me, but so far, nothing has changed. All we do is cuddle, and use baby talk, and it’s just not enough. I don’t want to make her feel bad or force her into anything she doesn’t want to do, but I won’t go on in a relationship where I can’t feel confident in my self and physically close to my partner.

      "edit: the following morning he told me that he hasn’t been watching porn since we had a conversation and i told him it made me uncomfortable. obviously now it’s up to me whether or not i believe him, but unfortunately my trust in him is changed. i went through a lot that night, before and after making this post and i really felt like i lost my relationship. like seriously i was ready to take my shit and leave. but now that we’ve talked about it for a few days, i feel better about it. i still don’t understand how a drunk confession like this could’ve been just a lie, and i will keep my eyes out for any further red flags. as our 2 year anniversary approaches, i feel uneasy about this, but im willing to stay if he really is telling the truth. for the record, im not stupid and i know a red flag when i see it, and i will not let him live this down/ forget abt it. it’ll always be in the back of my mind and hopefully the pain it caused me will be in the back of his. he’s going to start going back to therapy to unpack things from his past, but if this is still something he struggles with, im encouraging him to unpack that aswell. he says that it isn’t, and im trying to trust, but trust is hard now. thank you everybody for the advice. i’ve read all the comments and im holding it all in. (i am also on the prowl for a new therapist.) thank you guys 🩷\n",

      "Body text: I [29F] have been with my bf [30M] for 7 years, and we're thinking about the future. He comes from a rural part of England and his parents own a farm. We've just moved in together in a city neither of us grew up in, and I've been struggling with the thought of relocating to take over the family farm. Where we live now is closer to his parents farm than to my parents, so it's easier to visit his parents. He visits a lot, and is expected to do a lot of work on the farm, despite his 2 of his brothers living closer and not doing anything on the farm, but he doesn't mind. I do sometimes\n",
      "\n",
      "We have recently talked about the long term future and he's expressed not only his hope but excitement to take his family farm. It's something I was expecting tbh but I don't know if I want to. Maybe I have buried my head in the sand over it, hoping he'd leave that dream behind. I have a degree in a career where there are very few jobs in the county where the farm is, and growing up in the suburbs I'm not accustomed to country living. I am also susceptible to mental health problems and while I have done a lot of work in therapy and have been healthy for the last 2 years, I fear I could slip back into depression if I was isolated. That being said, the farm is only a 10 minute drive from the town, and it's closer to where I grew up than where we're currently living.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all being said, I love to craft and love to garden, and could see myself enjoying this farm life in that regard. And the other hobbies and things I enjoy can be found in the town by the farm. But would I be sacrificing too much, career wise? I could get a job in a sector close to mine and be happy, or get a job similar to what I'm doing now and work from home, but will I always want that? I know I certainly won't be turning into the perfect farm wife, but he's not expecting that from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We almost broke up last year because of his own mental health issues, but we decided we do want to be together. We are best friends, and truly do have so much in common, and I love his family, as he does mine. And I don't particularly want a future without him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the easiest thing to say is to just leave and never look back, especially how normal it is to see a woman sacrifice everything for a man, but I am happy with my life right now where we are, though I know we will have to move to the farm within the next 10 years due to his parents age.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR: My college friend is incredibly unstable and manipulative. I want things to change but don't see an easy way out. What do I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I (F24) have this friend (f23) who we will call W. W and I met in our first couple weeks of college and have been two of the only girls in a mostly male friend group for the past couple of years. When I met her, she was on the heels of an incredibly abusive relationship, a health issue, and was struggling significantly with her mental health. I myself have struggled with pretty severe OCD/ body dysmorphia, depression, and anorexia in the past, and, with meds and therapy, have been more or less stable since getting to college. This is all to say- I was incredibly empathetic to her situation and was happy to be a part of her support system, but was also working on my own problems.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our relationship in that first year was fun at times— she was funny, cool, and interesting and a blast to go out with. At the same time, my friendship with her was incredibly exhausting and emotionally one-sided. She was someone who needed constant reassurance and attention and had the tendency to have complete breakdowns (crying, locking herself in her room, threatening to hurt or even k\\*ll herself) in the face of even minor set backs or rejection. Everyone walked on egg shells around her because they were afraid that if they pushed back, criticized her, or failed to give her anything less than complete devotion she would harm herself. If you tried to tell her “no”, she would guilt trip you or wear you down until you did what she wanted. And god forbid you try to let her know that something she did affected you, or else she would apologize or denigrate herself (“I dont deserve friends, I am so so so sorry you should just drop me,” stuff like that) to the point that YOU became the one having to apologize to and comfort HER. She often belittled my own mental health struggles, casting herself as the one that was “really struggling” and completely disregarding that the reason I was, at least on the surface, doing better than her was  because I had taken accountability and put in the work every day to heal myself and my relationships.  Still, I attributed a lot of her more \\~difficult\\~ characteristics to this abusive situation and her mental health struggles. \n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on though, I began to recognize that the persistence of her melodramatic antics and manipulative behavior despite thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of intensive therapy, support, and medication is largely rooted in a combo of intense insecurity, immaturity, and self-centeredness. She continues to be incredibly manipulative to her friends, including me, by using her mental health as leverage to get what she wants. She is extremely jealous of my relationship and will openly insult him/ our relationship.  I have frequently told her that the level of physical intimacy (hugging, touching, cuddling) and emotional closeness she expects from me makes me feel uncomfortable and disrespected. She frequently questions the genuineness of my sexual identity (I have been in a relationship with a man most of the time I have known her) and then she recently switched her profile to show both men and women for no other reason than attention/ as an affectation, further evidencing the fact that she assumes everyone who is bisexual, including myself, is really straight. She makes constant uncomfortable comments comparing my body to hers in a way that makes me feel horrible given my continued struggle with BDD. I am queer and have had relationships with both men and women. She generally aggrandizes herself and exaggerates in a way that is incredibly transparent, and has recently put on this bizarre, vaguely British vocal affectation to make herself seem more intellectual. She does not really listen to you when you try to communicate her, which puts us in a position where we have to be extremely confrontational to get the point across/ set a boundary, which often leads to situations blowing up, then turning into yet another instance where we are having to comfort her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her behavior reflects incredibly poorly on all of us in the friend group, and I have had multiple people communicate that her presence in my life put them off on being friends with me. One of my friends has had repeated issues with his girlfriend because my friend treats him like a boyfriend, expecting him to drop everything and comfort her at her beck and call. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I accepted at a certain point that it is easier to indulge W and enable her bad behavior than push back, lest she threaten to hurt herself and coerce us into reengaging, but I feel like by just enabling her we have reinforced her bad behaviors, and now we are all trapped in an incredibly emotionally taxing and exhausting dead lock, unsure of what to do or say to improve the situation or make her recognize that her behavior is deeply inappropriate and an unacceptable way to conduct adult relationships. We have tried to communicate some of these issues with her before, but she is almost fundamentally unable to accept criticism and fear trying to tell her that we want space/ needs to work on herself will cause her to spiral. We are also unable to distance ourselves from her, as she is incredibly anxious about the status of our friendships and keeps track of the amount we are texting her as well as all of our locations. I literally feel like I am being held hostage emotionally and am quite frankly at my wits end. I have been trying to distance myself from her for years, but have been unable to due to the dynamic of our friend group. I try to push back against her bids for attention, and then she casts me as this callous monster for saying what everyone else is thinking. She has many positive characteristics and I keep second guessing the increasingly difficult to ignore fact that our friendship is not working due to her emotional instability and manipulativeness. \n",

      "Body text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n",

      "T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n",

      "There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n",

But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me.

      "Body text: My fiancé (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 4.5 years, engaged for one. We’ve lived together for about 3.5 years and got a dog together two years ago. We split our expenses 50/50, but I make significantly more than him, so I do my best to ease the financial load when I can — from meal prepping to covering little extras here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we met, I was still in college working service jobs, and he was the one who seemed driven and put-together. He didn’t finish college but had a career path ahead of him — one that unfortunately didn’t pan out. Since then, he’s switched jobs or career goals nearly every year. I stayed with him because I truly loved him, and he was my best friend. I had faith that he’d find his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got engaged last year, we were in a great place emotionally. But about a month later, something in me shifted. I started questioning everything. Not because I stopped loving him — I still do — but because I started imagining what a lifetime together would really look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reality is, I carry most of the emotional labor and domestic responsibilities. I do his laundry. I clean up after him. I do the grocery shopping and the cooking. He works night shifts and sleeps until 10 or 11, and then spends most of the day on the couch scrolling on his phone. Meanwhile, I’m working, staying active, taking care of our dog, and trying to grow personally. I want a partner who’s equally motivated — who does things with me, not just talks about doing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve stopped being intimate regularly, and I think it’s because the dynamic has shifted — I feel more like a caretaker than a fiancée. Every time I try to talk to him about how I feel, it becomes a “I don’t want to lose you” conversation, but then nothing changes. We carry on like we didn’t talk at all. I’m heartbroken, because I believed in the life we were building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with our dog, I do it all. He begged for her, I was hesitant, and now I’m the only one who walks her, trains her, or even thinks about her care. He says he “doesn’t like walking,” so after my own long day at work, I come home to dishes in the sink and a dog that hasn’t been walked. He sleeps until late morning, has the whole day before work, and still doesn’t help.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add to the frustration: even though money is tight for him, he spends hundreds on sneakers. Like, $250+ per pair — and they just show up at our apartment. He never sells them, even though he talks about it. A year and a half ago, he won $20,000 at the casino. I thought it would be a huge turning point, but that’s when I found out he had way more credit card debt than he ever disclosed. I was proud that he used the money to pay off the cards and cut them up, and he did set aside money to pay the taxes — but I was also disappointed that it didn’t change anything long-term. There should have been enough to start saving, but here we are now, and I don’t think he has any savings at all.\n",

      "Here’s where I’m stuck: I feel like I should leave. But I’m scared. Not just emotionally — financially. I’ve worked incredibly hard to build a stable, independent life for myself because I come from a family situation where stability wasn’t guaranteed. And while I thought I’d reached a place of independence, the reality is that without him, rent alone would be tough. I travel for work a few times a year, and we don’t live close to family, so I’d also need to pay for pet care or boarding — which adds up fast. That kind of instability terrifies me.\n",

      "And yet… I find myself daydreaming more and more often about decorating my own space, moving somewhere new, and just building a life on my own.

      "\n",
      "I guess I’m just looking for words of wisdom. I know what I probably need to do. But I don’t know how to do it. I’m scared of figuring out the logistics and being solely responsible for caring for our dog since it’s a no brainer she’d stay with me. I’m scared of handling rent on my own. I’m scared of not having someone to call when I’m having car troubles. It’s these types of complexities that I think about and wonder how I’d manage. \n",

One day I feel like I know the answer and I’m one foot out the door. The next day I waver and think maybe in 6 months when he gets a raise, his life will look better, he’ll be happier and by proxy our relationship will improve. Sorry for the blabbering, I’m just curious if anyone else has been in a similar position, what did you do? What was life like after you left and did you regret it?\n",

I’ve brought up my concerns, but nothing changes long term. I think I’ve outgrown him, but I’m scared to leave — mostly for financial reasons and fear of instability.

I think though for me, the better way to describe it is I love talking to people, but find it hard to open up to people (especially people I don’t know/just met). I also have a lot of anxiety and tend to overthink everything. My boyfriend is one of the only people in my life that I trust enough to be vulnerable around and be myself. But, I lately I’ve been worrying that we just don’t have chemistry.

      "\n",
      "I would think it’s just a bad communication because we’re long distance and FaceTiming, but I feel like it’s not necessarily better in person. Like once we went hiking together, and essentially walked the whole time in silence unless I tried to make conversation, but then the conversation wouldn’t carry and it would be silence again. \n",

But then again, when we’re hanging out with my/our friends, it always feels like he engages in conversation with them easily. Actually, I’ve been pissed before in the past because we’ve been out with friends and he’s spent the whole time locked in conversation with one my friends (F). Also, it’s not the same always the same friend, what I’m more so getting at is that it doesn’t feel like it’s just him having a quiet personality because I’ve seen him engaged in long convo with others friends. So it feels like maybe it’s just me that he doesn’t lock into convo with. \n",

      "Maybe it’s all just me overthinking it, but I just can’t get this worry out of my head. I’ve also been told in the past by a guy in the past that I’m “hard to talk to,” so I worry it’s my fault. But also I don’t know, I really do try to actually have and make conversation. Maybe I’m just not interesting? Or do we just not click? \n",

She understands me to a point that I feel like she knows me better than I do myself and vice versa. We are very civil and always respectful towards one another during disagreements even if they get pretty heated, so in that regard I know she is a very special girl and I do love her and plan on marrying her one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem lies within how bad her insecurities get and how much they control her, we have both agreed to delete our social media apps because of the volume of inappropriate content we would see. For me I see it as a distraction more than anything because my intentions are not to see any of that, especially in any media I watch I usually skip past anything that gets too explicit, but most of the time I tune it out because it’s not what I’m watching it for. She is unable to do this and gets uncomfortable and even angry at me many times, which I completely understand since seeing explicit things in general affects woman in a way that men don’t really understand. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have had many talks on this specifically and how insecure it makes her feel when I see those things, as if I’m going to compare her to woman she deems as more attractive than her. She always asks for reassurance and I happily provide that for her, because why would I not want to help the person I love feel better about themselves. I have let her know that although there are attractive women out there, in my eyes and in my heart she is the most beautiful woman on the planet, and I’ll chose her every single time over anybody else.\n",

      "I recently found out that whenever I say I’m watching a show on my own, that she goes and searches it on the web to see if it has any explicit scenes in it or woman dressed in a sexual way. When she told me this it felt like a shot to the chest because it’s like she doesn’t trust me to not give into temptation even though I have never shown her anything else by undying commitment to keeping our relationship healthy since we both have seen how couples break apart by not communicating properly.\n",

      "She has been asking me for extra reassurance lately and just asking me so many hypothetical questions about if I find her attractive still or if I look at other women lustfully, those types of things. It’s made me realize that I’m not doing anything to make her think, her insecurities just take over the wheel and make her say these things. Now when I reassure her or when she asks me to reassure her it doesn’t make me happy anymore it just feels like a chore, and I’ve done my best help her through these moments, but it doesn’t seem like anything I say really helps her even though she says it does.\n",

We found each other through FB dating and we vibed really well together. Her family really likes me, my family really likes her. We moved really fast. Like, after three dates we made it official to become bf/gf and maybe a month later, “I love you” was spoken, and moved in together at 8 months. At the time, we both felt like it was meant to be and that moving fast was ok if we were both comfortable with each other. \n",

The old and younger cat both have issues with the old cat pooping anywhere and vomiting everywhere, while the younger cat will pee anywhere (couch, bed, shoes). I thought to myself, “well maybe she will clean it and keep a watch over it all. It can’t be that bad”. Well, soon into our relationship I learned that she really doesn’t clean their boxes, so the stink can be very overwhelming, and she will leave barf just sitting on the carpet, sometimes for two weeks. Looking back, I feel like I really compromised/settled for her because I was just so sad and lonely.

She had mentioned how “this is the first weekend I’m free to do anything!” My heart skipped a beat and the first thing I wanted to do was ask her out to lunch.

I’m seeing all these qualities of a person I always envisioned myself being with. Smart, kind, well respected by all, warm. Now all these little things in my current relationship are coming up to the surface as things I’ve just been repressing. Things where I feel like I don’t have a voice in the relationship, I don’t always feel respected, I settled for someone that I thought would change, and that I’m with someone that doesn’t see my worth.

Sexual attraction is not an issue as it had been in my past relationships. But emotionally, we are not catching up. I have a history of being a poor communicator and slightly emotionally unavailable. But I went into this hopeful that with therapy and some quality time with him, I could start to bring my walls down.

I feel like there are some conversations that we should have had that haven't happened. Even when we became \"official\" it was because he just started calling me his girlfriend. When I asked him about it, it was because it \"made sense.\" I agreed because to me it made sense too; we have lots in common in terms of interests and values, we're both attracted to each other, live 15 minutes apart, and our families know each other.

We started the fire pit and I wanted to bring up finding ways to spend more time together but my heart was racing. It's not that I expected a bad response from him, I just felt embarrassed about expressing this need, and anxious about potentially diving into this conversation about what our intentions are about this relationship. I really want to plan a weekend with him. We could get an Airbnb somewhere and go hiking and fishing since it's getting warmer out. But he works on the weekend, and they're his peak hours.

In those moments, I feel like the parent instead of the partner, because even menial things like responding to an email give him anxiety. And I have to sometimes sit next to him while he does it so that he can just move on. I also get frustrated because at his age, I feel like he should have gotten a hold of it. All of this has also affected my attraction towards him. I’ve gotten less interested in being intimate.\n",

      "Body text: Hey everyone, I’m in a situation that’s been weighing heavily on me lately, and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective. I’m 20 years old and have been in a relationship for a year now. It’s my girlfriend’s second relationship, and it’s my first. We’re the same age. There are definitely great aspects to our relationship, and I do see potential — but there are also serious issues that leave me stuck between my future and this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, I used to hit the gym 4–5 times a week, especially during weekend nights with friends — it was an important part of my lifestyle. Since we became a couple, we’ve been spending almost every weekend together from Friday evening to Sunday night, and also a few evenings during the week. While I do enjoy our time together, we mostly just hang out, watch Netflix, go for walks — not really anything productive. The problem is, I also study, have to work, and I have a business project with a friend, and I want to keep up with the gym and start Muay Thai — I have goals I want to pursue while I’m young and have time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I try to talk to her about needing more time for myself and my goals, she takes it personally. She interprets it as me not loving her enough, not making her a priority, or wanting to see her less. She says she also has to study and work but still makes time for me, so I should be able to do the same. She has very high expectations of emotional presence — like wanting her partner to only have eyes for her and treat other women very distantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to emphasize that I’ve tried to communicate this with her — multiple times. I’ve explained that I need time for myself, not just for work or productivity, but because I function better when I have space to recharge and focus on what matters to me. Alone time is important for my well-being, but every time I try to express this, it ends in her feeling hurt or rejected. She takes it as a sign that I don’t care about her enough, rather than understanding that this is something I genuinely need. So while some people might say “just talk it through and find a compromise,” I feel like I’ve already done that — and it hasn’t worked. She sees my needs as a threat rather than something we could balance together.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a deep trust issue. Her last boyfriend betrayed her trust (flirting with other girls, keeping nudes, etc.), and I’ve made mistakes too. Most recently, she found that I had viewed some stupid thirst trap content on TikTok — nothing I saved or interacted with, just watched. But it triggered a big fight, and I fully understand why. I apologized, deleted TikTok, and acknowledged it as a moment of weakness and lack of dicipline I'm working on. But it really hurt her and worsened the trust issues that were already there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also gets upset over things that seem harmless to me. For example, one time I bought flowers for my mother’s birthday, and before heading into the gym, I asked a female staff member at the gym front desk (she was the only person there) if she could hold them for me during my workout, since they’d get damaged in my locker. My girlfriend was with me at the time, and afterwards, she was really upset — saying I was too nice to the staff member and that a “real man” shouldn’t speak so kindly to other women. From my perspective, it was just a practical and polite interaction — nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not even saying I need to be friends with other girls — that’s not what I’m after. I don’t feel the need for female friends. But at the very least, just being able to communicate normally, socialize, and maybe build connections if there is any value or so like a normal person — simply because it’s always valuable to know people and improve your social skills — is already a huge issue for her. In her eyes, like I mentioned, a man shouldn’t even be kind to another woman. To her, things like simply talking to other women or being friendly already feel like a form of cheating — because in her eyes, a truly loyal man only has eyes for her, ignores other girls completely, and would never initiate any kind of interaction with them, as that would already cross a boundary of trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often questions whether I’m really out with my friends and asks me to send proof. It’s exhausting. And while I’ve made my mistakes and try to take accountability, the trust issues have been there from the start and seem to be growing, not healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, I feel stuck between two paths. Part of me wants to hold on and try to fix things. But the other part wonders if I’m already giving up too much of myself just to maintain this relationship — and whether that’s something I’ll regret later. I’m trying to figure out what’s truly right for me long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I’m 20 and in a one-year relationship with someone I care about, but I’m stuck between growing as a person and keeping the relationship going. I’ve already communicated that I need time and space to focus on studying, the gym, and building a self-employment project — but my girlfriend takes that as rejection. Trust issues, emotional pressure, and control are wearing me down. I’m unsure whether to keep pushing or choose myself.\n",

During that time we became closer and even though I never had strong feelings for him, I sort of felt like I owed him for how much he helped me, so when he confessed that he was in love with me I decided to give him a chance. I think he’s a great guy, treats me like a literal queen and I can tell he loves me. I have love for him but I am not IN love with him. Things are comfortable with us..I’ve met his family, we have a nice apt together, everything is good except for the fact that I don’t feel this overwhelming feeling of love for him. My feelings for him change weekly. Some days I do feel like I’m falling in love with him and feel like I’m falling in love and get really excited, bur then sometimes I just feel like I’m settling, like I'm just living with a roommate. I don’t want to go back into the dating scene and don't trust many guys except for my boyfriend despite not being in love with him. I do eventually want a family and last night he brought it up asking me when I wanted to have kids and I almost had a panic attack.

      "Body text: This situation is with my (32F) boyfriend (31M) of 4 years. Even though he's only a boyfriend, we have a mortgage together and we also have a joint claim for benefits -if he earns more one month, I get less from the government that month because that's just how it works in the UK when you live together. So we're pretty financially tied together. \n",

      "In february, I found out he has just over £3000 in credit card debt that he had purposely hidden from me. He earns about £1200 after tax so his debt is equal to 2 and a half months worth of his income.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hid large purchases from me several times over the year it took him to get in that amount of debt. He was acting weird and secretive during a benefits reassessment and he lied straight to my face when I asked if he had debt or a separate account he was hiding (honestly I was hoping he had secretly been saving for a ring) and he said no. I saw his bank account statement when we were uploading them to the gov website for reassessment, and asked about one of the transactions that was weird. He tried to say it was cash that he had taken to the bank and paid in (another direct lie) when he had actually sent money from the credit card to his debit card.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him and the life we were building together so we've been trying to fix things. But I don't feel any closer to trusting him again than I did 3 months ago. I feel I'm actually becoming more upset as I confront the reality of dealing with that debt and I realise how many dreams are now unaffordable/delayed by at least 3 years while we pay off the debt- getting me an electric wheelchair, getting engaged/married, a new puppy, basic house repairs, a holiday. We had plans to make those things happen and those plans have all been pushed back. I feel like he lied by omission everytime we talked about those dreams and how we were going to make them happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides therapy, what can I do to improve this? What should I expect him to be doing? I've been checking his bank accounts weekly to see that he hasn't got more debt, but I hate doing it. \n",
      "\n",
      "His only explanation is that he thinks he has ADHD with impulsive spending and he was ashamed of the debt and he has a bad fear of rejection so he didn't want to tell me. He accepts that he fucked up but hasn't even really reassured me that it won't happen again or talked about how he will stop his impulsive spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sort out the joint bank account and make sure all the bills get paid and plan savings and yearly bills and pensions and all that kind of stuff- he just pays into it. I've asked him multiple times to get more involved but he avoids it. So it has been on me to plan how the debt will be paid off.\n",

      "Body text: I (24M) am having constant problems balancing my (22F) gf and my work/side hustle. My current routine is work, gym, side hustle, then chill/movie night with gf and I’ve been struggling to manage all of these. I work full time 8-5 in an office, and my job is pretty repetitive/boring to say the least but it is consistent and I’m grateful for it especially after dealing with unemployment for 3 months earlier this year. Following work and the gym, I create and sell commissioned art through my Instagram as my side hustle at home, which tends to take a few hours each night before I even get to finish them. Either my gf or I cook (usually my gf) and from 9pm to around 11 we chill together and watch tv/YouTube/or any show that we’re continuing. Recently I’ve been feeling torn between all of these things every night and stressed feeling like my day leaves no time for myself. My girlfriend has told me a few times that she “has to come before work” and I assured her that she does but thinking about it now I don’t feel I could have her as my #1 priority over my personal health and work to make sure my bills are paid. A few weeks ago I sat my gf down and pretty much broke up with her but we agreed to work on it together and i would start therapy later in May, so i don’t want to go back on my word and just quit on her. The current problem is that I just still feel so torn between all these things I’m trying to balance, and I wondered if there’s anything I can do to try. I love my gf and we’ve been together for almost 3 years. Art is my passion and I’ve grown my page/commissions to a decent size over the past couple years. My job is my job and I’ve got bills so of course I’m not changing that. I just don’t really know what to do \n",

      "I (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n",
      "\n",
      "We recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have decided to explicitly say I can’t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can’t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don’t want to be two-faced but also don’t want to cause more family drama and tension. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I are both 31 and have been together for a year and a half. He has a lot of unresolved childhood trauma and never learned healthy communication. This shows up constantly in our relationship—arguments escalate quickly, he avoids accountability, blames me, raises his voice, and talks down to me. When I try to express how I feel, he often tells me I’m being overly sensitive and to just “get over it” instead of trying to comfort me.\n",

Questions are listed at the bottom. im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory, so this may be kinda long. I am 20 and my younger sister is 17. I am a college student. My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds (mom is white and dad is black). \n",

      "My parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten. But, I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old, the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing. My dad was very involved in this sport; I needed to practice everyday, that’s reasonable! As I got older, this sport grew into a monster, I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play. So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches (1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse) so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age. There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3/4 summers straight, and every day after school was dedicated to practicing. I didnt mind this, but my mom is heavily dedicated to school. She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a’s in my all AP (advanced placement) classes. I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week. This was my life from ages 12-18. I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted, he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school, so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center. In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I left for college in 2023, I decided I was going to major in computer engineering. My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them. I ended up doing okay my first semester, but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes, leading to my suspension from the university. I was in over my head in all of my classes. My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college, never asking about my mental health. Only cared about my grades and told me to do some “soul searching”. I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic. Now that its been a year, im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since quitting sport (which was my dads thing), and failing school (which was my moms thing) i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me. When I was 16, i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima, which I was EXTREMELY grateful for, took great care of and love it. I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me. I pay for my rent, gas money, and groceries, which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying. Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years.\n",

      "My sister, who is 17, got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year. She has no pressure to be in any AP classes, she doesnt have a job, she doesnt play sports. She has no pressures in life, which has set her up for a great success in my opinion; she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore, she has picked up small hobbies in her free time. She goes to school, which shes late for all the time, comes home takes a shower and takes a nap. She stays in her room all the time, whereas I am always socializing with my parents. \n",
      "This started from a young age. When I entered middle school, I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick; when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup, she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup. She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us. These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this. \n",

Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has, or she’ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better. I try not to resent her, its really hard. I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family. \n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college (march2023-aug2023 when i left for college). My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice. I went to practice with a busted lip, bleeding nose, and huge bruise on my forehead. My younger sister saw, my mom wasnt home. My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident, but i could hold her off. Obviously it was different than when my dad did it. Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger. \n",

I was cheery and in a great mood, dressed for the occasion appropriately, making conversation the whole way, laughing and trying to be pleasant. My sister, sat with her airpods in, my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right, and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she (didnt want to spend her sunday doing this). She didnt even order food at the restaurant. When we sat down for dinner, my parents and I had a huge argument. I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now. When i left for college, I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter. She babysat for them a handful of times. I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer, and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job. At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1. I clapped back at her, since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money. Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job. My parents got furious that I said that, their only explanation was that it was their decision to “parent how they want to parent”. They were infuriated with me, instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude! \n",

      "Hi everyone. I’m posting here because I feel as though I have no one to talk to about this, and I’m feeling desperate. I (F29) have been with my partner (M27) for 2.5 years. We live together, work together, and made a big move together to another part of the country last year for our careers. We share a pet together, too. When I met my partner, he was sober. About 1 month into seeing him, he told me he had gone sober for abit because he was drinking and using cocaine too much. I understood this, and respected his decision to be sober. A couple months into dating, he got back into drinking, but didn’t touch drugs again. I didn’t mind this, as I love having a couple beer, and was happy to experience that with him. In the last 6-8 months, his drug use has started again. Picture this: we go out to the bar together, I stay until midnight or 1am. I go home because I’m tired. I have no problem with him staying later than me, I know he’s faithful. In the last 6-8 months, he comes home at 6am, 7am, 8am, after staying at the bars til close and then going to a friends house after to use cocaine. I ask him about it in the morning, and he admits to using coke, tells me he feels ashamed, and sorry. I tell him I want him to stop, and he says he feels like he can’t because he drinks so much that he gets to the point that he should go home, so takes Coke to sober up and stay out later. This happened again last night. We had a party for the two of us to celebrate an event in our careers. I went home at 12am (I’m simply not a party animal anymore) he said he’d stay out a bit later, I said okay. I woke up at 4am and he still wasn’t home, and I checked his location. He was at a friends house a few miles away. I texted him, he said he was there with a crew for after. He then came home at 8am and slept in the guest room. I told him I want to talk about this later today. I don’t know what to do. I love this man so much. We share a life together, have plans for the future, are each others best friends. At the party itself last night while I was still there, we were dancing around and singing, he was hugging me and telling me how much he loves me, and I feel the same way. I have no one to talk to about this because I’m humiliated that at his age, in his profession, he’s using cocaine on the weekends. This would have devastating, career-ending, profession-ending, repercussions if he were ever caught using coke. Worse, I stay up all night worrying about him getting a bad batch of coke and overdosing or being poisoned by fentanyl. I really think he has a substance abuse problem, and I don’t know what to do. Please help, thank you\n",

      "I need some advice from a non biased source regarding my relation ship. me (17m) and my gf(17f) have been together around 2.5 years now. my girlfriend has always been sensitive, very very sensitive. at first i admit it was challenging trying to talk to her/ comfort her while simultaneously not trying to say the wrong thing. but as time passed i was able to find a way of comforting her up until right around now.  sometime within the last 4-5 months it seems as things have greatly turned for the worse, all the time she always criticizes me for everything that i do. and it always makes me feel like such a piece of shit. and when i say all the time, im talking like once or twice a day where i accidentally fuck up (like for getting a concert date that she mentioned a few weeks prior) and she just completely shuts down, starts crying, talking about all the things that i did wrong and then, when i get visibly upset, she acts like it never happened. now of course i thought this would pass but its every fucking day where i go through this. and of course when i do actually mess up badly, ill take responsibility because im aware that i will make mistakes and what matter is how i deal with them moving on. \n",

      "Currently im torn on whether i should stay with her or not, like i miss all the memories we have together and sometimes now there are little sparks of how it used to be, but now all she does\n",
      " is be upset and she recently has become very anxious like out if nowhere and i have no idea why? (where im from anxiety and other mental disorders arent really talked about to much). Like i want to stay with her as im kinda scared for how the single life is, and i unfortunately made the mistake of revolving my life around her and only recently have i been making more friends at school. either way i want to stay together because theres a voice saying what if it gets better, but other the other hand im not sure how much of the constant criticism i can take anymore. \n",

      "Body text: Throwaway account, let’s try this again\n",
      "\n",
      "TL/DR: Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 6 months now. We’ve been away from each other for some time now. During this time away she has decided suddenly she wants to wait until marriage for sex. I want to stay with her, but I need advice on how to make this change more manageable for me or if it’s realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, I was aware she was a virgin (and hasn’t been in a relationship before) and she was aware that I have had multiple sexual experiences prior to her. Since it was her first, I was willing to take things extremely slow since I didn’t want to rush her into anything she wasn’t ready for. She also comes from a religious background and because of that has had the ideology installed in her that she should never have pre marital sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, we did have it, and over the course of the next 4-5 months we had it a lot. The first time we did I was hesitant because I didn’t feel comfortable as it wasn’t just a religious choice but a personal choice that she made, but shortly after we got together she went back on her word she made to her self and decided herself that she wanted to engage in it. Note that at that point, I was fully confident in myself that I would be able to wait until marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she recently left for a trip overseas back to her home country. This is where she grew up until 2 years ago. She went back to her family in a religious area and she’s been there for the past month and a half. I was afraid this shift back to what she knew might change the relationship, but I didn’t know to what extent\n",
      "\n",
      "2 things happened while she was gone… 1) We broke up for a short bit, after she voiced her concerns that I haven’t been emotionally available to her. She felt that we should take a break and remain as friends to strengthen our bond and eventually get together, however she was also clear that she still wanted a relationship with me. After some space from talking together and a lot of conversation we voiced our concerns and got back together, and I promised to do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the most recent thing… She mentioned she had something she wanted to talk about when she was back from her trip, but after asking to talk about it now, she told me she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex again. In the moment, because I love her and was willing to before we had it, I told her I was ok with that. However I very quickly realized that this is a huge decision to make on both of our parts and I didn’t want to tell her something if I can promise it. So the following day, I had another conversation with her and she explained further.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that she felt guilty and viewed sex as something sacred to her. She also said sometimes after a while of us having sex it lost value to her since it didn’t feel “sacred” to her as much. She made it clear that she wants to feel that we’re making love, not just doing the action. She said that she wouldn’t mind reducing the sex to special occasions, but she preferred if we stopped all together and waited until marriage. It’s important to note that she would be the one who usually asks me for sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where I’m at now. I’m conflicted, I don’t want to commit to something I can’t promise her, however i did see a future with her as she is the one I want to marry. Now however, I’m unsure about the constant changes she’s making to our relationship while being away, unsure about if I’m able to wait as we already had it once, and unsure if I should stick it through or leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also can’t shake the feeling that these changes and difficulties in our relationship when we haven’t been together may be causing some doubts in her mind, because as a person I realized she functions off of positive reinforcement and time spent together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men and women, I need advice from both sides on how to make this change more manageable for myself and if it’s realistic to wait possibly years after already engaging in the act.\n",

      "Title: My husband has changed so much since he became \"stable\". I can't tell if he even likes me anymore. Advice?\n",
      "Body text: Hello, I (23F) have been married to my husband (28M) for less than a year now, together for over 3 years now. I'll go ahead and say sorry bc this post will probably be all over the place, but I just need to get this out somewhere. I also apologize about formatting, I'm writing this on mobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some back story, my husband and I both have struggled with mental health, with us both being medicated. My husband has had a longer journey with getting properly medicated, and was not fully \"stable\" until about 1 year ago (Ie. Able to hold down a job/not having drastic mood swings).\n",
      "\n",
      " During the first 2 years of our relationship, we both got along pretty well, as we had a lot of the same interests and just tried to make each other happy. During this time, we both were supporting each other through mental health struggles ( I have anxiety/depression/ADHD, and he has anxiety/ADHD as well as a mood disorder). About a year ago, he hit a very low point and we agreed that it would be best for him to be admitted to an in patient facility. While it was awful at the time, the facility was able to get him properly medicated and he has not had to get a med change since then, with no highs/lows like before which is awesome! \n",
      "\n",
      "However, after the medicine change I noticed a shift in his overall demeanor. He was still himself, but his patience was lower, he was quicker to get annoyed, and he was more condescending. I've brought this up to him several times, but he says that he's always had anger issues, but his previous medications dulled his moods and his cognition. He said he feels better and smarter now, and that being grumpy is just \"part of who he is\". \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I've always been more silly/goofy, and will just ask questions about nonsense stuff just for the sake of talking with my husband and having fun. Before, he used to join in and we'd just be goof balls together, talking for hours on this and that, having fun. During the last year or so, I've noticed that when I try to do the same thing, he just looks at me like I'm dumb or scoffs at me like I'm a child who genuinely doesn't know better about something. I've stopped engaging in random conversations like that with him as often, but he gets annoyed at that too, saying I don't talk with him enough and that I don't spend enough time with him. But when I try to be myself, it absolutely feels like he's looking down on me or that he just thinks I'm dumb or something, when I'm just trying to be silly and have fun with the person I love. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to state for the record, he is also still goofy when HE'S in the mood to be, he loves meme culture, he likes to act goofy when he's in a good mood, and he likes to make up songs about stuff, dance around, or poke fun at himself or me. I don't really know how to describe it honestly; it's like if HE wants to be fun and silly, then it's fine, but if he's not in that mood and I act the same way, then it's because I'm dumber than him, not because I'm doing it on purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big issue is how he speaks to me during arguments. He admits that when he \"feels threatened\" (when I point out things he's doing that make me upset) he feels cornered and goes extreme because he wants to \"win\" the argument. I've talked with him about several issues with this:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. \"Winning\" is not the goal when you're having a problem in marriage, we're both supposed to be trying to solve issues together. He says he agrees with that statement, but whenever he discussed arguments from the past, he always has to point out if he \"won\" or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. He says hurtful/extreme things during arguments, but once everything is calmed down he backtracks, says he only said those things bc he was upset and that I shouldn't take it to hear. For example, he has told me that our entire marriage has been unhappy, that I don't care about him like he does me, that he's miserable around me, that he's relieved when he gets to go to work to \"be away from me\", and several times he's made comments along the lines of \"you have (xyz) because of ME, I'M the reason you have (gym membership/different bed/etc) and yet you treat me LIKE THIS\". He has also brought up divorce several times, stating if I don't \"change the way I behave, then this is going to end in divorce\".\n",
      "\n",
      " I try my best to hear out his side of things, listen to what he's been hurt by or feels unhappy with and make changes for him. And once the argument is over, and he's had a few hours to calm down, it's like a switch flips and he loves me so much, I'm the best wife ever, he doesn't know what he'd do without me, he's never going anywhere and he'll always be with me, etc etc. and then things will be good for a few weeks/a month, and then the next time we have tension it starts all over again. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably my biggest issue as of right now, because the going back and forth from 2 extremes; from him saying he feels \"miserable\" and that our marriage is unhappy/ruined, to turning around 2 hours later saying I'm the best thing that ever happen to him or he loves me more than anything, and he hates fighting and just wants to be happy together. I don't know how to handle it, and it makes me feel like I have to hold him at arms length, and I hate it. I feel so confused about how he actually feels about me, and it's starting to make me feel disconnected from him and the marriage \n",
      "\n",
      "For the record, we are both currently in therapy, and he is talking with him therapist about dealing with angry issues, and I'm working on communication skills and executive functioning, bc I am most certainly not perfect, and I have things I need to work on too. But I just don't know what to do as of right now. I don't feel like I can talk with him about his mood shifts, because he takes it as me saying it's his fault he has a mood disorder, and \"I knew what I was signing up for when I married him\". I've told him that while it's not his fault that he has angry issues/ mood shifts, the things he says and does when he's angry/upset are still his responsibility. It just makes him feel more upset, and he continues to say I'm blaming him for symptoms of a disability, when that's not my intent. All I want is for him to think about the things he says to me before he says them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel so selfish, but I miss the person he was when we started dating. I hate that I feel that way, because he's stable now and can hold a job and can keep routines, and he says he feels better and, for the most part, I can tell he does. I don't wish any of pain and anxiety he went through during low points in those first 2 years onto him, I just miss how much more joy he seemed to take in everyday things like taking a walk together, playing video games together for hours, exploring woods together, or staying up late baking cakes and making puzzles together. i miss that gentleness, I miss the kind person I knew. He says that he's more himself now, and for some reason that makes me sad, and I feel so incredible selfish for it. \n",

      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I feel like my husband has changed from the man I knew after he became \"stable\" with new medication, to the point that it feels like he doesn't even like me and I don't feel secure in the relationship. How do I deal with these feelings? How do I approach this with him?\n",

      "Body text: For a little background I work nights and my boyfriend works days usually different hours considering he is a manager and oversee’s a lot of people. We live separately and have talked about our future together. When we hangout it is usually at night after my shifts and we both leave in the morning when he has work. There is very little “intentional hangout’s” and his hobby is video games which take up a majority of his time as well as his friends. We both have problems with avoidant attachment and have been actively working through it together. Although I feel like the amount we text throughout the day isn’t enough for me to connect with him. We text Goodmorning, how are you, and I hope work is good. That is pretty much it, I have counted and it is usually 15-20 texts per day not conversations at all and it leaves me feeling kind of like a stranger. After his shifts I am usually at work so he gets on games and doesn’t get off until super late and then all we do is say goodnight and go to bed. I have expressed how this is concerning to me because I am afraid if I get another job we will have even less time to hangout in person and will have to rely on texting to connect. He said all couples go through this and I agree but I also feel like a lot of couples make more time to text if they aren’t as busy. I am afraid this will be worse in the future and I will be left feeling alone and just making small talk with my boyfriend everyday. I have taken a lot of time to think about if this is an issue with my attachment to him or our relationship or if this is an actual need for me in a relationship. I think it is a need but I don’t know how to bring it up to him or how to even work on this if it is an actual issue?\n",

      "Body text: i have been w my boyfriend for 3 years. we broke up once during the first year of the relationship, as he kept having memories of his ex and was still grieving her. a lot of things happened like i found out he was scrolling her pictures and chats behind my back, his wallpaper was her for a few months when we were dating, and more. but he said this was just grieving, he was just grieving his first love and he should be given the space and understanding to do that. and he says he chooses me as he is physically with me and trying for me. i trusted him yet he broke up with me a year in as he felt he couldn’t grieve her fully. after he left me he grieved her, wrote letters to her (that he never sent out..) saying “i still love you so much” and “i want to see you graduate, get married, i love you so much and always will”. then after awhile he felt lonely and got back together with me, saying he chooses me. \n",

      "when we got back together, he bumped into her and felt sad, saying he hasn’t grieved fully. i gave it time, thinking time will heal all wounds as he was still beside me trying his best to love me and be with me. during our one year anniversary he thought about his ex as we ate at an area he used to frequent with her and he suddenly felt abit down and quiet, so i asked him and he admitted. there were a few more instances like that the last 3 years, arguable lesser now.\n",

(he still has all her gifts in a box in his cupboard that he will never get rid of. he used to have her gift on his table for 5/6 months when we started dating… until i told him i don’t want it there.. but he doesn’t put my things up even after 3 years because it’s “demanding” of me to ask for that?)\n",

      "Safe to say they're very close and on the same level if not more than we are. I'm also friends with her, arguably longer than I have been friends with my bf! \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to start with saying that I love her and she absolutely loves me back and she's never directly done anything wrong, she also admitted she has a lot of mental and attachment issues and she can be a handful, I really don't want to shame her or start drama. But the way she acts whenever we hang around is incredibly overstimulating to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's CONSTANTLY talking about herself, interrupting people, rambling, very loudly singing when other people are talking. Whenever we hang out it's all her her and her. She isn't directly rude, just very unaware and self absorbed. And when you do bring it up, she explodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that she struggles with it, I have a developmental disorder and always struggled with social cues and reading the room. But every time we hang out and she acts like this ALL I can think about is \"When's the best time to ask to leave?\". I think one more good thing to bring it up is that I'm a pretty quiet person and I'm fine with not talking lots when hanging out, while she needs to talk constantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'd leave it at that, but she's my boyfriend's best friend and I can't just reject someone that important to him. She's very important to him and also a good friend of mine! She's absolutely lovely all this aside and very nice to me, I just can't stand hanging out with her for more than 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's good to mention we recently had a similar situation. Bout 2 months ago my boyfriend said he doesn't want the 3 of us hanging out together anymore because it tires and overstimulates him. I understood it and we stopped hanging out. Just today, he let it happen for the first time since and I was really excited. I also prepared beforehand and tried to talk to her more and us altogether instead of just him so he doesn't get fatigued. These two had a great time, and I did at first too, but 2 hours into her constant rambling, ranting, talking about herself (I don't think she directly addressed me at all, the whole day) and loud singing whenever someone's already talking genuinely drove me nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like her so much but this is driving me insane. And he just let us 3 hang out for the first time in a while, but I'd have to cut it short because I'm the one who has complaints now. They want me there tomorrow with them again but today tanked my mood, what do I do?\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend (31f, 31m) for about a year and a half. Overall, our relationship has been good, but something recently came up that I can’t stop thinking about, and it’s made me question a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks ago, a woman showed up in my suggested friends on social media. My boyfriend saw it and immediately asked how I knew her. I said I didn’t, and he got visibly weird and told me he had gone on a date with her “years ago.” It felt a little off, but I let it go at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some context: before we started dating, we were close friends for years. He had expressed romantic interest, and I had feelings too, but I was going through a really difficult time after losing my dad and struggling with my mental health. I wasn’t in a place to be in a relationship, so things stayed platonic — though we remained close.\n",
      "\n",
      "During that time, he repeatedly told me he wasn’t dating or sleeping with anyone else. I didn’t ask for that, and we weren’t in a relationship, so he was free to see other people. But it stood out to me because he went out of his way to assure me he wasn’t involved with anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the social media moment, I ended up finding out that not only had he been seeing the woman he mentioned, but their relationship was more involved than he made it seem — they went on multiple dates and were sleeping together. What really caught me off guard is that he ended things with her just a week before we became official.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I also found out that she wasn’t the only one. There were at least a couple of other women he had been seeing or hooking up with during that same period. Again, I wouldn’t have been upset if he’d been honest — we weren’t exclusive yet. But he lied about it, more than once, and in situations where I was directly asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "One example that really bothers me: early in our relationship, I was dealing with some gynecological issues and asked him when he’d last had sex — not to accuse him, but to be responsible and informed. He got defensive and said something like, “I don’t like what you’re implying,” which made me feel like I’d done something wrong by asking. Now I know he’d been sexually active with multiple people shortly before we got together, and it feels like a huge betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not about the fact that he dated other people — it’s that he chose to lie to me about it and make me feel like I was being unreasonable for even asking. I’ve trusted him completely up until now, but this has really shaken me. It makes me wonder what else he might not be telling the truth about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is a legitimate breach of trust. I don’t want to throw away a good relationship, but I also can’t ignore how this is making me feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I recently found out my boyfriend lied about dating and sleeping with multiple women shortly before we became official. At the time, he told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else and even got defensive when I asked about his sexual history due to health concerns. Now I feel betrayed and unsure how to move forward.\n",

      "I do in-house marketing at a company and have been here for a few years. One of my teammates, we’ll call her Taylor is 23 which is 5 years younger than me (this is kinda relevant to me because most people in my country graduate around that age so they wouldn't have more than intern experience out of the gate but she's from a different country so she had like 6 years somehow).

It feels deliberate and hurtful, especially since I’ve always tried to be kind, upfront, and supportive.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s also extremely competitive. She constantly talks about promotions and job-hunting, and while I’m not naturally competitive, I did start asking about a promotion myself (I’ve been here longer). She found out someone else had asked and cornered me about it, I didn’t confirm, but it was pretty obvious. Beyond that, I recently found out that the person she somewhat works under, a more senior competent colleague with a higher title has even complained about her saying he thinks she’s trying to angle for his job.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve also had a few moments of professional tension. She started stepping into projects I was already handling. My boss now checks with me before assigning her anything on my plate, which helps, but it created an odd dynamic. And when we do work together, she tends to take over and present it like she did everything. I get a quick mention at the beginning, and that’s it.

I want to go (I love the artist and wouldn't miss that for anything), but I haven’t paid her back yet for the ticket she bought last year as we've agreed to do the exchange closer to the date due to ticket transferring and stuff. I’ve been putting it off to ask to do it because things feel so weird, I was going to ask her but she left for vacation and now that she's back she's still being weird. Another friend she's bringing to the concert she didn't even want to introduce me to and she had several opportunities (she used to pass on lunch with me to go and take her out). That's no prob of course but if it were me I would want my friends to maybe meet ahead of the concert? When I go, I know I will likely be third wheeled but that's ok. I just don't want this bs at the office.\n",

I have a kid of 6 years and I was not particularly looking for a relationship when I met him . He was living with his partner (ex) [F31] and they have been togtehr for more than 12 years . And when  me and boyfriend met . In a couple of months we started doing more stuff together . Like he started doing a lot of activities together and we both visited each other and I introduced him to my son after 6 months of being in the relationship . I as well noticed that me and him both are not happy in a polyamorous relationship and it causes a lot of friction between us . I told him end of October (after a lot of self assessment and reflection for few months with my therapist etc) that I want to be monogomous . He said he wil need some time and after couple of months in January he broke up with his long term partner that now his ex that he still lives with .\n",

This all got to me and I told him this is all very tough on me . And I told him he cancelling plans with me to show up for her .\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "Hello everyone, I’m asking for kindness and non-judgmental advice and opinions as I’m going through a very difficult time in my life. I feel burnt out with life and I (27F) have self-sabotaged my first-ever loving relationship with my boyfriend (30M). For backstory, we met and dated during the pandemic. I was a non-traditional community college student about to transfer and he was a military sergeant who was thinking of pursuing college for the first time in order to become an officer. We fell in love and with some encouragement he applied to community college and I transferred. We lived 10 min from each other for a year and then 30 min from each other for 2 years. Although there are many precious memories, our arguments have reached a limit to him and I’m afraid there’s no turning back as much as I’m trying to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it all started when it was his turn to transfer and he was applying to a local university. I saw the potential in him and encouraged him to apply to the local private university that is known as one of the best in the country. He was hesitant yet he applied 2 weeks prior to the deadline. When he got accepted to the private university, I cried tears of joy. I was so very proud of him! However, I didn’t expect him to be loaded in work. Now he had military officer training (rotc), 20 units per quarter in order to graduate within 2 years, and tons of reading and essays. Meanwhile, I was finishing my last year of public university with school-related stress and severe imposter syndrome because I had tried for 3 years to obtain a major-related internship and failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I graduated in May 2024, my imposter syndrome got worse because I obtained a seasonal position I didn’t really want. Then, I was coming to a realization that my boyfriend’s college career was working out so well for him. This is when I first started feeling a bit jealous of my boyfriend. In the past year, he got accepted as an officer which means that will be his title/ranking in the military once he’s active after his graduation. This meant a year away from home to train and I was ok with that. I started planning out goals to achieve during our year away from each other so when I move in with him, I can be financially and mentally independent. But nothing in my life has worked out how I wanted it to.\n",

      "• I moved back in with my parents which meant we were 2 hrs away from each other.\n",

      "• I only worked for 2 months as a seasonal employee. My job search has led to a few interviews. I’ve been forced to accept job rejections and ghosting. I have tailored my resume multiple times with chatgpt and wrote cover letters for the positions I was really interested in. \n",

We’re all adults and I gave up my room so my aunt and her husband could sleep in it. To say I’m overwhelmed is an understatement. I have no privacy and my aunt is a highly opinionated woman and having to hear her voice everyday annoys me because I disagree with lots of things she says yet I have to remain composed and apathetic because I don’t want to make her feel disrespected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve only hung out with my boyfriend for 2-3 weekends this year and the last 2 weekends were messy and unhealthy that I don’t really remember most of the arguments. The first weekend I recall feeling sad because he was not giving me enough attention but that was the norm because he was always busy with school. What triggered me was seeing a matching bracelet I gave him. I had mine on but his was on a shelf and that killed me emotionally. I didn’t say anything and went into his apartment bathroom to cry on the floor. After an hour of crying, I kept thinking to myself “Why isn’t he coming for me? Why am I torturing myself?”. I had enough and went into the small living room and cried. I was still ignored for hours. After about 3 hours of just crying on the floor, I started hitting myself and saying things like “you don’t love me”. I ripped the matching bracelet off of me. He obviously reacted but didn’t hug me. He told me to relax and we talked while I cried and then I told him to hug me. He told me to play a game on my iPad and then we went to bed cuddling and had sex. The next day it was as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second weekend we hung out, I didn’t feel like cooking with him which is usually what we do. I felt tired of my life and was only thinking of jobs and career future. I do remember opening up about being so worried that my plans weren’t working out and how traumatic this job search has been. I felt like not owning a car and having all my savings decrease overtime made me feel like a worthless girlfriend. What do I have to offer when we move in together? The next day, I don’t remember what he said but I started packing up my stuff crying. I told him I wasn’t feeling good and that it would be best if I leave. We then sat down and he started getting a bit upset that in the past 2 years I always run away during an argument or over something he says. He had told me he was walking on egg shells and I told him the same. I was running away but letting him know for the first time ever which was kind of hard to do. Looking back, it’s a bit of growth to even be a bit open in communication instead of being silently dramatic when running away. I didn’t leave and the next day we went on a beautiful hike and had lunch. This was 5 weeks ago. \n",

      "Coming back home, I realized that I’m not ok. I felt on the verge of burnout. My self-esteem was at its lowest and I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. Nothing brings me joy. I decided to seek therapy because I was done feeling overwhelmed with life. I was jealous of my boyfriend’s life and tired of not being able to regulate my emotions. I knew this was depression. Eventually, I broke down at home because I was rejected from the 2 positions I had interviewed at. I wasted an entire month just interviewing with those companies and carrying false hope. Breaking down for me is ugly. So much self-loathing sentiments and the urge to simply die but being unable to. A huge wave of negative thoughts I’ve been telling myself about everything including my relationship overtook me and I blew it later that night (Mother’s Day weekend). He FaceTimes me and in the recent months, our conversations have been about his upcoming graduation. With attitude, I let him know that it’s best if he gives away my graduation ticket to someone else in his family because they will enjoy and celebrate him more than I ever will. He asked “What did you say?” And I said “You know what I said”. He sternly smiled and said ok. We hung up and I went to sleep with deep shame. I had my first therapy session the next day and the connection wasn’t there which was frustrating. I realized I regretted hurting my boyfriend and that what I truly needed was a psychiatrist. I meet her this Wednesday. Anyways, my boyfriend still texted me and I kindly said I wasn’t feeling well and that I would text him another day. He told me that was ok and to feel better. It took me 4 days to calm down and during those 4 days I finally opened up to my mom about what was going on with me. I cried because I had negative 10 dollars in my bank account all because my ego didn’t allow me to work a regular retail/fast food job. I felt a bit better once I made my psych appointment because I wanted to change for the better. I’m tired of hurting the people that love me the most. After 4 days, I texted him what was up and he ignored me. After a few messages he tells me he had the roughest weekend ever, that I wouldn’t understand and wants to be alone and just focus on finishing strong in order to graduate. I said I was here now and to talk to me and he refused. I called him 8 times until he picked up with attitude. I told him this is clearly a relationship issue and it’s an urgent matter that needs to be fixed. He basically said he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I cause a lot of stress and pain for him and the resentment had been building up overtime which led him not trusting me anymore. I knew all of our problems that I instigated were part of his decision but clearly the graduation ticket comment was the breaking point. I cried so much and had another mental breakdown. I opened up to my mom about all the times I’ve been so mean and spiteful to him and how he didn’t deserve any of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a few days he accepted a phone call where I apologized and let him know I was already trying to seek help and I wanted him to give us another chance. He said no as it didn’t matter anymore since he’s leaving for a year. I cried again for almost a week and I felt I was going crazy. The psych ward couldn’t have me as I didn’t have plans to you know what. I was referred to a crisis counselor that didn’t help at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then chose to drive to him since I hadn’t seen him in 5 weeks. I left a care package of food and snacks that I paid with a credit card. He kindly accepted it and took me for a walk to talk. We catched up as if nothing had ever happened. Then we started talking about the care package. He said he felt so bad that I wasn’t coping well and had driven 2 hrs to see him. He wanted to give me money and I refused. He told me “you know you’re struggling”. That hurt me to the max and I apologized again about the graduation comments and anything I ever said or did. He said the resentment was there but that all was forgiven. He said he couldn’t take me back if I didn’t love myself. He said “How can you love someone else if you don’t love yourself?”. He had watery eyes throughout our conversation but I just ugly cried. I told him I was already making a huge step to fixing myself and he said no. He said he asked many times for me to change and he never saw it. He doesn’t believe I will change and my heart shattered. I had self-sabotaged my relationship. We hugged one last time and he didn’t want to kiss me so I don’t get false hope of reconciliation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how I drove back home but I haven’t eaten in 2 days and my family doesn’t understand me at all. They just want me to accept and feel better. I have to hear them talk about how disrespectful I am that I’m not eating or doing anything. I’m officially burnt out and want my own space to mourn. I keep beating myself up even though he told me not to. He told me he cares a lot about me and still loves me and I lowkey feel betrayed because he has never left before when I’m out of my mind. His graduation week includes officer training graduation, his birthday, and our 4 year anniversary as well. All hopes and dreams are lost because of me and I truly regret hurting him. Why couldn’t I support him when he loved me? Does anyone have stories about reconciliation? Any advice? Thank you for reading. I’m lost and I’m very sorry this is all about me. I hope to be better.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I’ve been deeply depressed and overwhelmed with life. I pushed away the person I love the most and now he says he can’t be with me anymore. He still cares, but says I need to focus and love myself first. I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist soon but he says he doesn’t want to pursue the relationship anymore. Is there any hope for reconciliation? How do I move forward when I feel like I destroyed everything?\n",

      "Body text: Hi all, this isn’t exactly a super specific situation, but kind of an overarching thing. I love my girlfriend of 4 years, and while we have our ups and downs, I plan to be with her long term. I am very close with my family though, and it feels like a lot of the interactions between the two are strained and awkward, tbh often at the hand of my gf. I don’t blame her, my family can be difficult to read and especially for someone who is likely on the spectrum, (very high functioning), who is socially awkward, my family would be difficult to navigate. My dad has told me a few years ago that he doesn’t think she’s the ‘right fit’ for the family, which was really hard to hear and he has told me that he regrets saying it. Regardless, I still feel like there is a lack of chemistry and I’ve tried helping from both sides. Is a relationship doomed to fail if they can’t mesh well? I love them both very much and don’t want to have to have distance between the two.\n",

We've had tough times and have learned a lot together about how to compromise and how to show up for each other in the way the other person needs. We bicker a lot but 95% of the time we end up laughing at ourselves. We rarely argue and never fight, I think I've yelled at him 2 times and he's never yelled at me.

      "\n",
      "We’ve been together for nearly three years, and up until recently, our relationship was the healthiest and happiest I’ve ever experienced.

It felt like the standard we had both upheld suddenly disappeared, without explanation.\n",

The rent is cheap and I'm incredibly grateful they've allowed me to stay, but I feel like our lifestyles are different and I worry our friendship will get ruined. I have mental health issues that are now classed as a disability so I'm unemployed but receiving benefits. I struggle to get out of bed most days, and sometimes I don't even cook for myself as I have zero motivation and energy - plus, going out and cooking a meal always seems to end up with having to talk with him or his mom and I'm quite an introvert.

My friend also often does MDMA and sells it which I feel uncomfortable about. I smoke weed but other drugs aren't my thing. I've been able to go back to visit my Mom's place (I technically can't live with her permanently due to her living in a retirement village and people over 55 can't live there.. although I question whether it could be classed as discrimination due to my disabilities). I've felt comfortable and safe living with my Mom and she helps with with things but I know it can't be permanent here.

      "Title: Are my parents (M41 & F43) manipulative and controlling?\n",
      "Body text: My parents( M41 and F43) and I (F18) have been getting into more fights this year with it being my senior year and i am about to head off to college. The fights have been about be dating a boy(M18) this year. For context, this is our seventh month dating and have been trying to make the most of our time with me going to an out of state college that is 6 hours away from our hometown. He is a 2.5 gpa student where as im a 3.9 gpa student. around our third month, we felt it was time to give ourselves away to each other in a car(safely and consensually of course). Three montrhs later, his mom told my mom and I denied it all while he admitted it thinking I would cave. My parents understandably angry lost their shit on me. We didnt have a civil conversation, it was just constant yelling and screaming with college,car,track, and freedom taken away.  They gave it back only to revoke it away again after they saw me wearing a ring that he had gotten me. They thought i stopped seeing him but i hadnt. So it was back to the name calling, screaming, and the freedom gone again. I made a reddit post about it on AITAH and most of reddit agreed that I was in fact NTA and that my parents are manipulative and controlling. My boyfriend said that my parents were being nasty and manipulative. I have noticed the signs for awhile even before this with me usually being \"second mommy\" for my three siblings but I dont want to believe it. My mom is telling me she doesnt understand why i dont trust them but they put such high expectations on me and brought the hammer down whenever i messed up for the tinest thing. Did not clean the dishes: no phone. Got a C in a class: dissapointed. Ask them to stay in one night rather than going out for drinks leaving me with children: ridiculed for having an attitude and being hateful. They think my boyfriend isnt going to college even though he is, and when i told them he is they said it was not the same way. He's paying for his college and potentinally getting a scholarship or two. Im not paying for college and still have to pay $23,000/year. My dad has threatened violence against me and him. My boyfriend keeps saying that I need to get away from them while my parents are saying i need to get away from him and my friends (F18, F17, F18, F18, M17) are on my boyfriend's side while my grandparents(M67 & F65)(who are paying for my college) took my parents'. I feel like a horrible daughter and i cant tell which path is right. I feel like i betrayed them and am being entitled but Im also scared im blowing this up over nothing and they are just protecting me and im being too diffucult. I understand their concerns but they havent even sat down to talk with my boyfriend. They refuse to get to know him. \n",

      "Body text: A bit of context:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been together for pretty much exactly a year now, and before we met, relationships were still something completely foreign to me (which I guess is normal, at 16). I was in a pretty weird headspace when we started seeing each other, to say the least, and I am very grateful to her for getting me out of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a year has gone by, and we've never really had any big issues. There weren't really any fights I could recall, and we try to talk about everything as well as possible. She loves to talk about our possible futures, from moving into the city together to study to later owning our very own little farm. And I know those are just fantasies, but whenever she talks about them, I can't help but feel that that's not where I see myself. That I can't imagine myself anywhere, with her, and I feel so bad about it because I think I very much still love her, but I have no idea on how to talk about it with her, or what to do. I will now elaborate a bit on our current situation as to give a bit more context, I'm sorry if it'll be a bit of a long one.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's not particularly doing well right now. In fact, since I've know her, she never has. She has massive anxiety issues, and I'm pretty much her only way out of it, for the moment. There hardly passes a day where I'm not comforting her to sleep while she's in tears, where I'm not spending at times hours of convincing her that things are going to get better, and believe me, there is not a single thing I want more in this world than for her to get better. She claims that her life has always been this way, that she's never really been happy before, that this is just a part of who she is and that she has been hiding this, from everyone, forever. At the start of this year, I finally managed to find her a therapist she is now seeing, and I just hope that things will improve. Let me be clear, there are absolutely times when, especially when we're out doing something together, she is genuinely really happy, and those are the moments I live for, but she is still very emotionally reliant on me, especially since she doesn't really have any close friends currently to speak of that could help her (apart from me). And while of course, I try my best to always be there for her, it's very taxing for me as well. I just hope that, when things improve, I will also be able to see us moving forward together again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, sometimes, I ask myself: What if things *don't* improve? I feel like, the way things are *right now*, I don't have it in me to continue even another year. But then again, I also don't have it in me in the slightest to end things, as I just know in how bad of a state that would leave her. And let me be absolutely clear here, she is acutely aware of how big of a problem there is. I don't want this coming off as her \"taking advantage\" of me, she knows that things have to get better, she's actively trying everything she can, but it's difficult, of course it is, and it's not her fault, it's nobody's fault. But the question still remains: What if things don't get better, or don't get better quickly enough? In fact, the reason why I'm really writing this post is: I'm already at a point where I feel like the relationship is basically nothing but work for me. But there are still moments where I'm reminded of why I fell in love with her in the first place, and I do still think she's a fantastic human being, which somehow makes it worse. I have to lie in her face about things being fine because all of the alternatives are infinitely worse. I can't fathom breaking up or even really talking about this in a direct manner because while I theoretically don't owe her anything, I could not live with what a breakup would do to her in this already incredibly difficult time, and I think I genuinely do still love her.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the most important thing is talking with her about it, I just need to find a way to do that that wouldn't make things worse. In any case, thank you for taking your time reading all of this, that's already worth so much to me. Whatever advice you can give me, I'll be very happy about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I, M18, have been in my first relationship for a year with my girlfriend (F18), who struggles with severe anxiety and is very emotionally dependent on me. Although I very much still love her, I'm a bit emotionally exhausted and unsure about our future together. I fear things could not improve, but a breakup is completely out of the question for me, due to the state it would leave her in, and the fact I still believe she is a genuinely great person that I don't want to lose either. Now I don't know how to continue onward.\n",

      "Body text: We’ve been official for about 4 months now. I love her and she genuinely seems deeply in love with me when we are together and we get along very well. We usually spend our weekends together so I see her fairly often. But when we text, she is pretty slow to reply or inconsistent at best, doesn’t really update me often until after the fact or when she sees she has left me unanswered for a while, and doesn’t engage in meaningful conversation even though I try to. She usually isn’t too busy in the evenings but doesn’t usually make much effort to talk to me much at night from what it seems. Ive brought it up and she says she’s usually busy reading or cooking or that she’ll get better at it (she’s used to being single and not talking to someone often). Im not so much worried something is going on as I am slightly annoyed at our discourse at this point. I’d be much more receptive to late replies if we actually were talking about something beyond what we are doing at that exact moment. I feel like I’m constantly making cute advances to get her attention or trying to just have a nice conversation with my girlfriend just to get a “thank you my love”, a short almost flippant seeming reply, or a text back that has nothing to do with what I said before it pertaining to her or something shes doing. Whats a good way of fostering better text communication between us or should I just prioritize myself and not text her as often?\n",

      "I’m thinking about getting into a relationship in a few years, but honestly, I’m struggling with some fears and patterns that come from my family life.

I haven’t seen any positive way to argue or reach healthy endings modeled for me. I know this isn’t good, but it feels satisfying emotionally in the short term.\n",
      "2. **Fear of one-sided effort:** If I help her, I’m scared she won’t reciprocate. I tend to expect a clear “payback” for my efforts, and if it doesn’t happen, I think I’d end up resenting her. I realize this is also unhealthy.\n",
      "3. **Trust issues:** I’m afraid of betrayal to the point that I feel like I’d need full access to her phone to trust her.\n",

      "My girlfriend and I reconnected in fall 2020 after having been just acquaintances (if even that) in high school a few years prior. Everything was going just incredible … we clicked on every level and our honeymoon period lasted literally years. She’s my first girlfriend while she’s been in a few relationships before.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have some similar interests, find a lot of the same things funny, and really enjoyed each other’s company for years. Prior to all of this I would’ve said she’s a *very* sweet, kind, and gentle person, truly. I thought and think of myself as a pretty nice guy too lol although perhaps not to her level.\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved into a small apartment together summer of 2024 and almost immediately, things got kind of bad, to put it plainly. I knew she was far and away not the tidiest person in the world (extremely hygienic (self-hygiene) but also extremely untidy in terms of keeping the apartment clear and tidy) but didn’t expect it to be so awful. To put it simply, we had an abject mess (I called it a pigsty, honestly) in our small apartment for over six months. And I really mean like shit *all* over the floor to the point where it was a mini hoarder’s home and you had to deliberately find small clear paths to walk through. It was like a goddamn minefield LOL. Maybe an actual minefield would’ve even been preferable for my sanity! It was a mix of her stuff and mine, but really mostly her stuff. I seriously cannot overemphasize how gross it was—not like food and crap out, but just everything that would have been stowed in a normal person’s home was out and about in ours. I understand sometimes it takes time to clear your stuff out, especially for people having moved out for the first time and especially in a small home, but come on, man. I also understand some homes can be “lived in,” but this also was just anything but that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bothered me *immensely*. Immensely is a huge understatement, really. I’ve never suspected I had OCD or anything like that and really still don’t—I’m just a guy who likes a tidy home. I don’t need every single speck of dust and every single, I don’t know, tiny little thing to be away, but 99% of your shit just has to be away, I feel. At the very least, you need enough goddamn floor space to be able to move around freely!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even knowing just how much it disgusted and bothered me, she did almost nothing. She would tell me she’s doing it little by little but I’m sorry, if that were really the case then after six months (a little more, actually) I would’ve at the very least seen a dent put in the mess, but I didn’t. And yes, of course I offered to help, especially after seeing she just wasn’t doing it. I don’t understand how anyone could live in conditions like that. I didn’t have family or friends or anyone over just because I was horrified by the mess and knew they would be too. Again, there seemed to be close to zero effort put into clearing it on her end.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, I decided enough was enough and, entirely by myself (just saying lol), I cleared the entire apartment’s worth of crap in two days. It took me an entire working day to clear out all the crap in the living room and kitchen, and then an entire working day to clear out the bedroom too. Let me again emphasize that it wasn’t entirely her stuff—there was some of mine mixed in too, especially in the bedroom. I’m not going to put 100% of the blame on her because that’s just not right. After I cleared it, everything was spotless, and I mean spotless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, she asked (kind of demanded, really, but I’ve done the same with a few things too) to be able to put her work bags and stuff on a section of the floor adjacent to our couch because she “needed it for easy access.” Okay, whatever. Not optimal but that’s a compromise I’m very willing to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has crescendoed to: our kitchen table is packed with mail (90% hers—again, I am to blame here too), our living room has a large floor section inaccessible to do her having taken out her I believe summer clothes but “not having found time” to put them away, her side of the bedroom (adjacent to her bed) is overflowing with random crap, and even the little adjacent-to-the-couch section of her bags is untidy too. Maybe this all sounds stupid and insignificant to you, but Jesus Christ it bothers the absolute *fuck* out of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is incredible with cleaning the bathroom and all the chores she has to do (we split pretty much evenly), but the tidiness is just … I have no words. She has told me she does not regard clearing up the apartment as a chore! She prioritizes even going to the gym or a bike ride over that. I do not understand it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of moving in itself was awful as well. My parents had spent a very considerable amount of time rearranging the apartment after my grandpa passed and trying to keep the best furniture. I understand that it was our first time moving out and that it was exciting and this and that and we have big ideas for the apartment and we’re going to buy $5,000 of new furniture, and hoopah and hakkah and yadda yadda yadda. That is all well and good, but we went about this in a ridiculous way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like when you move into a new place, you try to put all your stuff away and see how everything turns out. Of course, if some furniture is old or ugly or whatever, it’s gotta go. However, her approach which I could not compromise her out of was getting rid of furniture while not replacing all of it. Why is this a huge problem? The apartment is, again, small and quite limited in space, and what do you know, to this day we still have big space issues! Why the hell would you get rid of furniture BEFORE you’ve even finished moving in; before even evaluating how much space you truly end up with?!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the goddamn TVs lol. I’ll try to keep this one short: they are entirely too high and I didn’t get much of a say. Instead of simply putting the living room TV on a stand, we wall mounted it. She said it’s because “people trip over them” and it happened to her sisters in their youth. Okay, not a big deal. Well the day her dad and sister came over to install our two TVs, it was basically a 3 versus 1 … I pleaded my case that they were too high while her and her dad were quite pushy and we ended up with TVs mounted insanely high lol. Like it hurts my neck to watch! Doesn’t sound like a big deal, but my opinion wasn’t really heard and now that we agreed to compromise and lower them, her idea of “compromise” here is to, in her words, lower it by an inch or so. Okay. Lol. “Compromise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat is also an issue. She was my grandpa’s before he passed and is a total sweetheart. My girlfriend knew that a prerequisite of us moving in was taking the cat with us as my cat at home (also a sweetheart but a diva as well lol) does not tolerate any other cats. Grandpa’s cat had to come with us. Grandpa’s cat has long fur and it gets everywhere—it’s just how it is. It’s not great. She’s also a little overweight (vet and I have been working on it) and oozes a gross reddish-brown fluid from around her anus, and it gets on the bed. Again, very much less than optimal!\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend tolerates the cat but *hates* cleaning up the fur and the stains we get on the bed. I don’t like it either! But it is what it is. Her solution to this is a proposal to not let the cat in the bedroom at all. This, quite frankly, is a total nonstarter for me as the cat is an indoor cat and cutting her access to the bedroom means she has something like 33% less space (or thereabouts) to roam and live, not to mention the fact she wouldn’t be able to cuddle us at night the way she likes. That proposal sounds borderline cruel to me. We didn’t really come to an agreement so she’s taken to simply shutting the door after I leave for work, meaning from 9  to 5 PM the cat is locked out of the bedroom anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also doesn’t feed the cat nor clean the litter box. Again, she knew that the cat was coming with us. Anyway, with the litter box: cool, whatever. Can’t say I enjoy shoveling cat poo every morning but I’ll do it. Feeding a cat however is far less gross and takes, what, maybe a minute max? And that’s if you’re slow! How long does it really take to get a new bowl, get a can of cat food, open the can, and put it in a bowl? I’d say about a minute lol. But she doesn’t do that out of principle! Seriously, like I will be at work or just not at home and the cat will be hungry and she just … won’t feed it out of principle. It really pisses me off. I’ve of course asked why and every time the answer has been, “u/bcyankees, I just don’t want to take on another responsibility!” Let me again remind you that this would be a one-minute “responsibility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, due to the constant fighting, we’ve really just lost mutual respect for one another. I don’t know better to state that, truly. It is just the frank truth. In fact, during an argument a few months ago, she told me verbatim that she “doesn’t respect me anymore.” That, by the way, sounds like something you’d only say to your partner if you were trying to hurt them. I’ve never said anything objectionable to her apart from snide comments during arguments (obviously not cool or right, I know) and once calling her lazy for not clearing up her shit. She has called me a D-word multiple times during arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve really had enough of all this horseshit all this time and finally summoned up the courage (if that sounds odd, it’ll make sense in just a moment) to address these concerns with her after three weeks of putting this conversation off. The reason I was putting it off is because I just knew exactly how it was gonna go, and boy was I right, quite unfortunately …\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing up the mutual disrespect first, we both acknowledged it was bad. Her solution is couple’s therapy (which she’s brought up multiple times over the months) but that is honestly a nonstarter for me. When I then said that I was just fed up with the current state of the apartment and earnestly pleaded her to address it, at least a little (and I’ve done so about a million times over since moving in, sometimes quite nicely, sometimes abrasively, honestly), I was met with the reaction I expected. **NO, NO, NO!**Well, basically that. She absolutely shut me the fuck down and invalidated my concerns, telling me she wasn’t going to sit there and have me complain about her when I had initially framed it as a conversation we needed to have. Instantly, shut down. Instantly. She’s been hearing this for months but it really came to a boil here. In fact, I’ve been *very* cautious about bringing up her untidiness to her lately as it upsets her acutely and immediately. Her rule is I am not allowed to voice my concerns in the morning or in the evening (yes, seriously), so this limits me to only the weekends lol. And even then, like I’ve said, I haven’t told her a damn thing in probably close to a month because she gets pissed any time I bring up even a small thing that needs to be put away!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that’s kind of it. Immediately shut down, and I just took it like a B. I didn’t even stand up for myself—I’m just so defeated after all this time lol. What was a spectacularly perfect relationship became … this … in the span of less than six months.\n",
      "\n",

      "Body text: My gf says that I don’t “joke around” with her anymore or enjoy being around with her since we’ve moved in together, and that I’m always in my default “chill” mood. I’m content with her and my routine (work, gym, art, spend time together at dinner), but she keeps feeling like I’m annoyed to be around her. I’ve tried to reassure her that I enjoy her presence, and we watch a movie/episode of a show every night to make sure that we’re getting quality time with each other, but nothing really seems to work to help her understand. She does have adhd and anxiety and (I think as a result?) our energy levels tend to be drastically different most of the time. I’m generally a laid back person and she is absolutely hyper until she “crashes” at around 8pm daily. I’ve grown to accept our differing personalities/energy level but me being laid back tends to really bother her. I do love this girl but at times it just feels like we have opposite personalities.

      "Body text: Ok so I’m [19F] and my bf is [19M]. We’ve been dating since 8th grade and have taken long breaks 3 times since we started dating. We’ve been dating about 5 years since our last breakup. Needless to say we’ve had many issues we had to work through to stay together so long. Lately we’ve been having issues again with me not feeling loved. Ik he cares for me, but he doesn’t do a good job of showing through actions that he loves me. I’ve had conversations with him about it, and how even the small things like notes in the morning or surprising me with my favorite snack once in a while would make a big difference. He promised both times that he would try and he just hasn’t. I thought if I did some of the things I asked for, for him, then it would inspire him to do the same. Like I’ve dropped off his favorite snack and drink, brought him little gifts, even gave him flowers, and he has yet to do any of that for me. It’s been months since this issue has been reoccurring. I’m so frustrated, I need help. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, Ik I can’t force him to do these things for me, I just want them to come naturally when they clearly aren’t. Has he just gotten comfortable with me being the one to always try and fix/improve things? I don’t want to give up on everything we’ve built together. \n",

      "ok so before anyone reads on firstly want to provide context.\n",
      "\n",
      "**me and this person met last year was together for about 7months. It didn't work out because he blindsided me but returned a few months ago to try again and all of the rest that follows.**\n",
      "\n",
      "at this moment in time things have been better and different in certain ways but I am not entirely convinced or satisfied. This can sound entitled but I mean it in the context of \"am I wasting my time again?\". when I say things have been different or better I mean that the way things are handled this time around shows more care and understanding when before it was met with denial and defensiveness  a sort of \"well thats your problem you feel that way\". So in those terms things are good.\n",
      "\n",
      "but there are some reasons I don't feel certain and I guess I am trying to work out whether the good outweighs the \"bad\" and if its something that could be worked on etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "first point and the main point is that I feel like there is a lack of emotion on his side. For example, if a problem arises there is no emotional comfort just a logical solution with nothing else. for me if there is a problem solution is important but also emotional upkeep like checking in etc. I also feel like theres a lack of romantic gesture the way I'd register it such as surprising me with flowers, sweet messages, general sentimental gifts and im not talking super expensive jewellery or handbags but gifts that communicate \"I was thinking of you and I know this would make you really happy\". He has demonstrated this before at the start of our reunion he wrote to me and when I asked why his reason was \"I knew you'd like it alot\" so the explanation of him being unaware isn't the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me onto the second point which is connected. The lack of romantic gestures which he is aware I would appreciate makes me feel like he's just not into it and like I am not **truly** appreciated and cared for. It was women's celebration in a community we both are part of and the day before I said \"that means you should get me flowers\" in a jokey context and the response was fairly cold \"A bit late notice now next time\" and to be honest fair if he saw it this way but id rather get flowers one day late than wait till next year to roll around. It is cliche but it's like the phrase \"if he wanted to he would\" and to me he just isn't. And if you're thinking the issue is more than flowers then you'd be right it is. Its not the act of getting the flowers or not its how I am left feeling which is unappreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "and lastly which is sort of half and half me and him but I have noticed after a deep discussion (if I am upset by something or vice versa) he goes evidently cold the next day. Less warmth in tone etc and im not sure if thats normal, if im reading to deeply into it or whether its completely external from what I think is causing it but it furthers my doubts of \"I went to far in explaining my needs or upsets\" \"im pushing him away or being too sensitive\" and so fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "to top it off it has been almost 4months since getting into contact again and there has been no talk of commitment or desire to be with each other which is quite confusing. I mentioned it once and was met with \"we should speak about it in person\" ....we have since met twice and no mention. Yes I could bring it up if im concerned but again I would feel more certain if he mentioned it as he is the guy and I am not ashamed to say I would like the guy im with to lead these things.\n",

      "Body text: I (29F) am looking for ways to mend a relationship with a friend I was pretty close to. I currently have a 3-4 good girlfriends. Girls who we get together and do different activities, spa dates, girls nights, all the things. But there is one friend who I have been very distant with since about February. We’ll call her friend #1.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a falling out between a past friend and myself. We’ll call her friend #2. So friend #2 and I have been friends for about 5 years. We were very close. She always came to my home. I would cook for her, invite her to my family events, and invite her out with my other friends. I noticed that this friend was not reciprocating at all. It got worse over time. In January 2025, I went to dinner with friend #1. We went to a place that me, friend #1 and #2 went to together in November, but it’s important to note that these two girls are not friends. They know each other through me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward back to January 2025, friend #1 and I went to dinner and posted pictures to our stories. Apparently friend #2 was very upset about this but did not tell me. I did not invite her because she mentioned to me she was trying to get her car from the tow yard and did not have the funds. So I didn’t press her. We went to dinner that Friday, and that following Sunday friend #2 came to my house. Ate my food and drank my good wine. Did not mention she was upset about not being invited to dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later that week, friend #2 has a birthday dinner at the same place and I did not get invited. We go to each others birthday celebrations every year so I was very hurt by that. Especially because she told me on Sunday that she did not have any plans. I confronted her about it and then blocked her because I felt this is always happening. She’s never the same kind of friend to me that I am to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Friend #2 then reached out to friend #1 and told her that I cussed her out and called her all kinds of names which is not true because I do not speak to people that way. Friend #1 came back to me and told me that she was mad because we didn’t invite her to dinner so she wanted to get back at me. I told friend #1 that is so disrespectful for someone to come into my home, take up my space and knowing they had a problem with me that whole time. That made me so uncomfortable and I was seething at the fact someone could do that. I immediately said to myself “no one else can come to my home”. It’s my sanctuary and where I feel the most safe and do not want people bringing unnecessary energy into my space.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is the part I need help with. Friend #1 decided to come to me and say that I need to hear friend #2 out because she is hurting as well. Even when I said AGAIN why it was so disrespectful she kept saying I should listen to her feelings as well. I think this is where my trauma comes into play because I am often a considerate and kind friend, but at what point can I not cut someone off for not being a good friend to me? And being malicious about it? \n",
      "\n",
      "Friend #1 and I had this conversation in February. This is typically how our conversations go where she is constantly playing devils advocate and she never actually HEARS or SEES me. I could say it until I’m blue in the face that the other girl was wrong, but she somehow still thinks I need to chase this girl and reconcile with her. And mind you she has known me much longer. For years. She just met this girl. I have not hung out with friend #1 that much since. I have been pretty distant because I just felt like I wasn’t being heard. I want so badly to tell her that but I have seen how she responds when people come to her about how they feel. There is not much grace given. I want to approach her about it but I do not know if it’s too late or if she would just flat out think it’s stupid and silly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;dr I am not sure how to mend a friendship with someone who I feels like doesn’t hear or see me whenever I give my input. It has caused me to resent this person and I don’t know how to change it. \n",

The gist of what I've envisioned can be summed up as: retire within a decade to live off a certain amount (the # I had in mind is pretty modest) and spend the rest of my days being active, exploring nature, travelling (anywhere between a little domestically or a moderate amount anywhere depending on if kids are in the picture, which I could go either way on - it'd depend largely (but not solely) on my partner being on a similar financial wavelength - i.e. similar spending habits, perspective on money, can bring say, half (ballpark) of what I can to the table in terms of net worth by the time we're both ready to quit working, given the additional financial burden that comes with kids, especially in the US).\n",

She's very much okay with this reality for herself and the idea of working forever and just generally having a slightly below average standard of living; relationships alone are what make her whole. While I definitely wouldn't be whole without a like-minded partner, I also don't want to be poor forever. Maybe that makes me hollow, but I don't know how else to explain it besides I just want more out of life than the minimum in that regard and would probably feel unfulfilled and as though I've cut myself short and haven't lived up to my potential otherwise. So I'm stuck between a few conflicting thoughts - on one hand:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- My job is very unpleasant to put it mildly, and to retire early, it'll have been a large chunk of my soul I'll have exchanged in return. To make that sacrifice/reach that pinnacle to find myself having to fully fund my partner's retirement because of the financial situation she locked herself into that I alluded to earlier, is a pretty bad feeling. As would be the alternative of having her work forever (having a partner to actually live life with when I am retired is important to me). Basically when it comes to $ I have the opposite perspective on a woman's role in a relationship as the whatever podcast (while I find some of their stuff entertaining, they're into women basically existing to (list of things I don't think I can mention without this post getting auto-flagged) while the dude is the sole provider in return, which isn't quite for me). I'd rather be w/ an equal (or close to) that wants to build towards a shared vision of a future. Current GF is directionless as far as what she wants, but is down with the future I've envisioned for myself. Which to me is great. She just has no capacity to contribute towards it. Which isn't to say there aren't other great things she brings to the relationship that make the journey all the more enjoyable and that I value greatly. But to me, it still doesn't dilute the importance of being able to contribute financially.\n",

      "On the other hand:\n",

      "\\- Part of me feels bad for basically having second thoughts about this relationship because my partner will never be able to save money and will be either mostly financially dependent on me, or will just need to work forever.

      "Body text: I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (19M) for 2 years. Throughout our relationship, my boyfriend has always been relatively good with consistent love. We would have deep talks at night, wish each other a good morning, see each other at school, and make sacrifices to see each other, even just for a minute. It's also important to note that my boyfriend has been diagnosed with ASPD, so I've always been mindful that expressing certain feelings may be hard (we have had several long talks about it), and it's never seemed to be an issue in our relationship.\n",

      "However, over the past couple of months, my boyfriend has suddenly been giving me extreme mixed signals. It's a long story - but our school, alongside other schools (we are a small town, so we conjoined with others) went to Greece. His distance started there, where he seemingly avoided me, wouldn't smile or express any emotions with me, and wouldn't even make eye contact. I tried my best to give him space while remaining loving, but even after the trip, the distance didn't subside. I eventually confronted him over it, and he ended up sobbing and apologizing. He promised to change. However, since then, he has still been very off. Whenever we are in public (at school, at functions, really anywhere with other people) he seems emotionless when I'm around. He talks quietly, avoids PDA (we also talked about this, in which he told me he definitely enjoys PDA), and often doesn't smile or make eye contact. I often feel like a lost puppy and an after-thought, as he smiles and laughs freely with his other friends. However, in private (calling at night or hanging out), he behaves as I have always known him. He even talks about how much he cares about me, and how excited he is for 'our future' (although sometimes he is distant when the future comes up). Ive also noticed other behaviors which I find confusing, like being distant during our good mornings, ignoring my texts, prioritizing hobbies (he does jujitsu for the majority of the week and will often prefer to partake in that or other sports than seeing me), which of course is fine, but believe me, ITS WEIRD! This emotional whiplash has gotten me so confused, so I brought it up to him a couple days ago, but nothing seemed to come of it.\n",

      "I’ve (20F) been seeing a guy (24M) for a year now, mostly long distance (USA-Greece) I wanted to be with him this summer but not without planning something productive on the side, so I got myself a research internship at a prestigious University in his country and used that as the main purpose of my summer trip when I told my parents my plans. \n",

My dad is actually coming to Greece next month for a short period of time, and joked that maybe he could stay with me (it’s a one bedroom with one bed, and I showed him that). The reason why I haven’t told my parents, is because I’ve never introduced any man to them, they’re very protective of me, and I’ve never spoken to them about my romantic life. I don’t want their judgment/input/analysis on my relationship with this man and I don’t want them to make it into a bigger deal than it is. At the same time I feel really uncomfortable with the feeling that I’m disrespecting the man I’m with, disrespecting his parents who really like me and lastly disrespecting my own parents. I have expressed my feelings and emotions to the man that I’m with, and he understands me. But I’m not sure what to do, and I’m really not keen on telling them. I would appreciate any advice, and please be gentle because I already feel guilty and immature as is. \n",

We recently broke up about 3 months ago bc he choose to spend all his time with his friends, couldn’t keep a job longer than a few months and pretty much made me feel like he never wanted to see me. Like choose everything and everyone over me. Well we got back together he promised things would change. They haven’t. Still no job. I haven’t seen him in 2 weeks. He lives 20 mins from me and isn’t busy but says he is. I’m so tired of asking hey when can I see you? Like he says he loves me and he text me all day everyday but I want more than that I want a real relationship with a future not a pen pal. I’m honestly not happy with how things are. A few days ago I had a guy I dated a few times a few years ago message me asking how I was and we’ve been messaging ever since. He honestly is everything I want in a guy and when we dated I ran away bc I wasn’t ready for what he wanted at the time but now I feel like we are on the same page. I feel like an absolutely terrible person for even talking to him while I’m in a relationship. He knows the situation and we’ve only talked. Of course he’s trying to persuade me his way bc he says he still cares about me always has and always will. He was able to recall everything I ever told him and every detail of every date we had. Definitely surprised me he cared that much to remember everything. But I do feel so guilty bc I do love my boyfriend but I know in my heart he’s never going to be able to be who I need him to be. He says he’s trying but never put anything into action. He’s constantly jumping from one thing to another. He changes his mind like he changes underwear and it makes me an absolute wreck. Because I like stability and consistency. I know what I need to do but I’m having such a hard time going through with it bc I do love him and I don’t want to hurt him but his empty promises are slowing tearing away at me. \n",

      "Body text: I’m a 38-year-old man in a 12-month relationship with a woman (33F) who is kind, calm, and easy to be with. There’s no drama. On paper, it looks stable—no fighting, shared values, and a mutual desire to start a family. She came out of a 10-year relationship before this; I’ve had a few short to medium-term ones.\n",

      "But emotionally and physically, I feel increasingly disconnected.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s very little passion. We barely kiss, sex is rare, and I hardly feel physical desire toward her anymore. In the beginning, we were more sexually active—but I was always the one initiating. Over time, I’ve lost interest. When we do have sex, it feels quiet, passive, and emotionless. No playfulness, no sounds, no intensity. So far this year, we’ve only had sex 5–6 times.\n",

      "To clarify: my libido is fine. I feel sexual desire in general and find other people attractive. So I’m confident this isn’t a physical issue—it’s specific to *this* connection.\n",

      "There’s also a lack of emotional depth. Our conversations mostly stay on the surface. She never asks how I’m feeling, and she rarely shares much about herself.

      "Body text: ok, so basically my bf and I have been dating for like 5 months, and over the last week I've been thinking if I really want to be in a relationship. We are both 17, but he dropped out of school and is working, and I'm still in school and am very, very busy with extracurriculars and studying in my last year of high school. So we see each other usually once or twice every week or 2, but we mainly communicate through snap videos, just so it's like a facetime, but whenever either of us are free, we can just open it and respond. But lately I've been a really bad girlfriend and not responded for a couple of days at a time, and I kind of blamed it on me being so busy because I have been in a musical that's gone on over the past month or so and which we only closed the other day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, to get to the point, idk if it's because of my raging adhd and the fact that I keep seeing the timer for how long he's been on delivered for as a deadline, but I'm the kind of person who physically and mentally shuts down when I'm stressed and I don't want to talk to anyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "He's my first boyfriend, and I've had crushes before him, but the way we were talking before he asked me out was in a very friend-like kind of way, and I wouldn't say I had a crush on him when we started dating. We were just talking for so long (like months) that i kind of felt the pressure to date him (not to say i entirely didn't want to, i liked him to a point and had fun talking to him so i assumed that's what the relationship would kind of look like and since he's my first boyfriend i kind of had no clue on how a relationship works.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a couple of things in common, and he's attractive and funny, and I obviously like him, but he keeps going on about going on trips away or how he's going to drive to see me when I move to uni next year, and i have big goals and ambitions, where I want to go places and pursue different things and hobbies and enjoy experiencing life, but he is more close minded with the fact of moving on to bigger things (I think mostly because he's already got a stable job and everything). He also brought up the idea of sex when I was drunk and he was driving me home, but I didn't really respond because I was uncomfy and one thing that really kind of freaked me out was that he told my friend (when he was drunk so take it with a grain of salt) that he's \"in this for marriage\". Like he's moving too fast for me, and I think it's selfish of me if I can't give him the attention and time he deserves. He's a really lovely person and I do enjoy spending time with him it's just that I don't think our relationship is sustainable in the way he probably thinks it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The catalyst for me beginning to think this way was recently when we were together he was telling me about how much he thinks about me, especially when we are seeing each other that day and how excited he gets, which I said the same for me, because no confrontation means everyone is happy right. But I began to feel really bad about not feeling the same way and I know I don't put as much effort into the relationship as him and he really is trying, but I just feel like I'm being toxic and selfish in not communicating these things but at the same time i literally cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other things;\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- sometimes he gets a bit to touchy or wants physical affection and that's fine and this is entirely my fault for not saying anything, but i hate confrontation more than anything in the entire world, and i can tell he gets a bit off when he hints at a kiss and i don't give one. I am just not a big physical person\n",

It is a healthy commited relationship and we are using the break to work on ourselves and have agreed to remain faithful to one another. I feel a lot of mixed emotions rn and I love him but I’m tied between thinking I deserve better or working through this break and come out stronger. My bf values his alone him A LOT. He hates calling and due to schedules I only see him once a week. He is someone who could probably be totally fine not having a relationship and if anything would probably prefer the alone time. On top of this he is very much laid back and prior to our break I brought up that I need more for this relationship to work. I want him to plan dates for us every now and then, surprise me with flowers once in awhile, and just put more effort into me.

She works and she comes here to see her family once a month, or every other month. Whenever she comes, I always try to see her, respecting her schedule. It's ok because her family lives in a village, which means it's hard to find a commute to our town sometimes. But it also means that I often have to take my daughter with me becausey husband is at work at the time my friend comes to the town. So I think she doesn't like the fact that I take my child with us, but what am I supposed to do, leave her alone? Last two times she came to visit her family, I didn't have an idea about that until she went back home. This morning I saw her cousin tagged her in a story from a club here. I thought it might be an old photo, but I saw she was wearing a new dress she sent me last week (asking which one to buy lmao). So she came again and didn't even tell me. I understand that having kids change relationships, and also she has a right to get some lunch and talk to a friend without them running aroung after a toddler.

We’ve agreed on raising our children to choose their own religion and he agreed to move back to my home town with me when I decide I’m over living in NY. We wanted to move in together, but decided not to because it would make his parents uncomfortable. I met his mom a few months ago and it was nice but felt like she was vetting me more than trying to get to know me. His dad would not acknowledge our relationship for the longest time and is depressed/not eating due to the relationship. He has met my parents and stayed at my family’s house for the holidays. I am afraid the rest of our lives is going to be a challenge. I am afraid his parents will never love me and will try to influence our relationship and choices at every step. He says they won’t but I don’t think he is being realistic. I am at the crossroads of breaking up with him or staying with him and committing to the idea that life might be hard with him but at least he’s an amazing parter/person.

      "So, my sister (27F) and her fiance (32M) live at my mom’s house with us. They have been together for 5 years. And lived together with us for 3. Ever since the beginning my sister has made it apparently clear that he always says he hates me and my mom which makes no sense for a variety of reasons, but especially because my mother provides for him and he is just rude in return. And he thinks it’s funny. \n",
      "Anyways tonight I was trying to let him know a pan was hot and to not touch it and he wouldn’t even acknowledge me then said sarcastically “oh yea the first thing I’ll do is touch the pans”. I was a bit upset by that because it felt unnecessarily rude. My mom then OFFERED (for free) for them to have our couch when they move, and he rolled his eyes instead of responding. Mind you they had just gotten home after a fun day so I don’t think anyone can justify this attitude. Even further for context, he is always rude. He makes rude jokes about me or at me about things that I do or say due to my diagnosed autism. And he constantly makes rude statements about my widowed mother who works insanely hard to keep this roof over our heads. He is extremely condescending and racist and misogynistic. My sister always used to stand up for me but she just excuses it when he does it. She even agrees with him now which hurts. But because I’m nice I still have tried tirelessly since they moved in to make small talk with him or engage with him about his interests yet he ignores me or finds a way to make a condescending joke about me. I’m nothing but nice and kind to him. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Also should add before he ever moved in (first 2 years of their relationship) he literally didn’t say a word to me and I mean for EXTENDED periods of time like 6 hour family party’s would blatantly ignore me and not acknowledge my presence. But then other times he’s randomly nice to me or asks me a thoughtful question. It’s so confusing. But he still seems to do it in a idc I’m just asking cause I have to way.

I have waited minutes at a time. When I ask again he briskly will answer me, or just say \"yeah yeah\". It makes me feel like a nag.

I am traveling to Europe in 9 days for my goddaughter's baptism, and these are the shoes I am planning to wear. I had asked him ages ago if he could fix it so that I could test them out to make sure they wouldn't break again straight away, He said \"of course\".

I do all of these at the drop of a hat - because I know it took SO much energy to ask for the help... Sadly I don't feel like he applies that same mentality to me.

      "Title: How to deal with partner wanting nothing to do with one of my close friends\n",
      "Body text: This is a throwaway account. I’m a 30-year-old guy, and I’ve been close friends with “Jen” (30f) since I was 17. We became best friends in our senior year of high school and stayed close well into our 20s. Jen has always been in relationships. I know she’s struggled with self-esteem issues due to her weight, but for as long as I’ve known her, she’s either been dating someone or talking to a guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She became like extended family. I’d go out with her family, and she’d join mine on vacations. But she’s always prioritized her romantic relationships, which I assumed was just her way of doing things. She would regularly choose time with her partner over plans with me. A few times, it really bothered me — like once when we had plans to hang out for the night, but she bailed last minute because her boyfriend became available. Another time, on New Year’s Eve, she left me and another friend to go be with her boyfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also rarely introduced me to the people she dated. She was with one guy for three years, and I only met him once. I haven’t dated much (I’m a gay male), and whenever I did start seeing someone, Jen would always say they weren’t good enough or that I shouldn’t be seeing them — which I took to heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first real relationship — the one I’m still in — started just before COVID. I really liked him (m31), and unlike Jen, I didn’t want to keep my partner separate from my friendships. I introduced them a few times, and things seemed fine. Then the pandemic hit, and we followed all the precautions closely due to my immunocompromised family member.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, Jen wanted to meet up with the two of us. We went to a local bar, wore masks, and kept to our table. My partner is very social, and when he heard a couple playing a song he liked on the jukebox, he started chatting with them up near the bar. When he eventually introduced us, Jen was noticeably standoffish. She didn’t say much and soon decided to leave. After she left, the woman from the couple mentioned Jen had come off as rude. I didn’t even know the woman, but I wasn’t comfortable staying there with people talking negatively about my friend — especially during COVID — so I left too, and my partner followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, Jen was furious. She yelled at my partner, saying it was disrespectful for him to socialize with strangers given my family’s health situation. She was going off for a few minutes, and my partner started getting frustrated. Eventually, I decided to leave with my partner, and Jen said something like, “I see whose side you’re on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I told Jen I needed space and decided to prioritize my relationship, the same way I felt she had always prioritized hers. We didn’t really see each other for over a year and a half. When we finally did reconnect, I told her my partner was still very upset about how she treated him and didn’t want anything to do with her. She was remorseful and said she wanted to apologize. I passed that on to my partner, but he shut it down — he still didn’t want anything to do with her. I didn’t push it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, my friendship with Jen has changed. We catch up every few months, but we’re not as close as we used to be. My partner gets along well with my other friends, and we regularly do group outings. Recently, one of my friends posted pictures from one of these hangouts on social media, and Jen noticed. When we met up not long after, she asked if she could join next time. At the end of our hangout, she said she’d love to come along to one of our group events.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked about it with one of my other best friends, who also knows Jen and everything that happened. She told me we can’t just expect my partner to be okay with Jen coming along — especially since he’s been part of the group for a while now — and she’d rather my partner be there than Jen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m conflicted. I agree with my friend — I’m not going to invite someone who will make my partner uncomfortable. I don’t know if Jen thinks everything has blown over, but the truth is, she never actually apologized directly to my partner, and he’s still not open to any kind of communication with her. I’m going to just approach the subject with my partner so he knows she’s asked but I’m not going to expect him to want her to hang out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;dr, my partner wants nothing do with my friend after she blew up on him a few years ago and wants to start hanging out with me and a group of friends that my partner is in \n",

      "Body text: My (M22) GF (F21) of 1 year and 3 months is really insecure and has a hard time trusting people. So I did my best to become very understanding for her. When she feels jealous of my guy friends, I assure her that I want to spend most of my time with her and of course I do that. When she feels insecure because of my female friends/classmates, I block them on social medias and cut them off completely so that she doesn't feel jealous. Whenever I want to study or go to the gym, but she doesn't want me to because she needs comfort and wants to spend time with me, I give it to her. We both setted boundaries about things that we love. I told her it is about acads and football.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here is where the problem starts. I start opening up to her that I too need friends so I can survive my college life since I am not the most academic. She reluctantly agrees to it, but whenever she knows I am talking to another woman about acads, she gets mad. This continues on and on. Whenever I have major engineering exams, she always picks fights with me. I keep telling her not to do it because it messes up with my focus. She promises not to do it again, but the next exam she does it again. The same goes with talking with friends and doing other hobbies. Whenever I want to play football, she always tries to talk me out of it, unless my training is mandatory. Whenever I play pick-up football, she prevents me to play especially when she knows that there are women there. So of course, I followed her wishes, thinking it would be worth it in the long run. I tried to be understanding as I can. But, after all those things that I have done for her, she never respected nor trusts me. \n",

      "Body text: Myself (19m) and a friend (19f) of mine have entered a strange time together. For context, I’ve been friends with her for 5/6 years, we went to highschool together but we didn’t go to the same college. It was the same overall college but just different branches/departments and buildings. I went and did my A-levels whereas she had always been a massive animal lover and so she studied animal care at a local farm just a  5 minute walk from my house. \n",
      "\n",
      "We spoke for hours and hours every single day. I caught feelings for her-she was just everything I could ever hope to have in someone. However I knew nothing would come of it since she always said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship whenever the topic was brought up. She would say that she’s scared of them because she felt that it would feel forced and fake and that the commitment was another thing that scared her because she didn’t want a relationship to feel like a chore or a job. And so I didn’t pursue and instead kept my feelings to myself, and got on with life.\n",
      "\n",
      "This went on for months until one night I broke down and told her how I felt and how I already knew that it wouldn’t lead to anything, and I was right. We didn’t get together but we stayed close friends. She thought it was sweet that I felt I could talk to her even about something like that and was thankful for my honesty but that she just wasn’t ready. Which is exactly what I knew it would be like-in my head I already knew that nothing would come of it so in fact I wasn’t too hurt by the rejection. I simply had to tell her how I felt, I had felt that way for months and the feelings and want to say something just became too much for me to handle anymore and so I told her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that night we went and carried on as we were, as friends. My feelings for her never went away though as much as I wanted and thought they should, after a few more months it became too much for me and I had a mental dip. I was upset I couldn’t stop how I felt and be normal. I lost all motivation and everything became dull in my life. Our friendship whilst we both wanted it to continue, I started to feel awkward around her because it felt like torture in my chest to be there knowing I felt how I felt but couldn’t be lucky enough to be with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little by little our conversations became drier and drier until in December 2023 they just stopped completely. I know that it was my fault why it happened but it became painful to talk to her and not being able to move on like I desperately wanted to in order to save our friendship. Sadly we stopped speaking for a year and 3 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that time I went through a bad 6 months long relationship, I lost my virginity, enjoyed the first few months of that relationship and had finally managed to move on from her. And yet we continued to not speak. My relationship ended when I discovered that who I was with had cheated on me with someone I had called a friend for years before that point. \n",
      "\n",
      "I finished college and got my A- levels and months later a cat photo was sent into a group chat that myself and my friend used to talk together in but had gone dead after we stopped speaking. We both reacted to the cat photo and spoke to each other in the group for a little while before moving to our DMs. The friendship was back. And all it took was a cat photo. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were both ecstatic to be talking to each other again. I apologised for not messaging and basically leaving and gave my half of the reasons behind it (which I have already told you). Her side of the story was that she was scared that I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore and that she had missed me a lot. I had missed her a lot too. I missed our talks, our inside jokes, our late night conversations. We stepped back into our friendship so easily it was as if the last year hadn’t had happened at all. It was exactly how things used to be. It was PERFECT.  We caught up, spoke for hours and hours, it was 20 to 5 in the morning when we went to sleep.  Everything was back to how we both had wished it had been, and for a few weeks everything was amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it happened, I caught feelings again, not as strongly as the first time and it isn’t affecting our friendship. And I’m actually able to keep myself in check this time and not let them take over. It’s now been 3 months since we started speaking again and life just seems so much better than what it was like without her. My feelings for her seem to come and go to an extent, some days I feel them strongly whilst other days it’s more so in the background of my mind. When we talk I just feel at peace in a way I have never felt with anyone else.\n",

She says that her ideal relationship would be one where there’s a deep connection before deciding to date, she also says that she’d want to be friends with benefits before committing to dating with that person so she already knows what it’s like and doesn’t make sex feel like an awkward topic in her head to actually discuss or do  when with that person. \n",

I know that some of the stuff I say I’ve done and would like to do is stuff she’d love too, I can tell by how she responds and often tells me that she’d love that. I don’t know if she just feels comfortable enough with me to tell me stuff like that or if she’s dropping hints she wants to do it with me but is too shy to fully say it.

      "Body text: Me and K(17F) have been friends for quite a long time, almost 10 years but we didnt see each other for a while due to the shift from primary to early secondary, but we became friends again a couple years ago. However over the last school year we became really close, easily and quickly becoming best friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never really thought too much of her as more than a best friend up until about 3 months ago. I was at some gathering for a friend's birthday, and late in the night someone half-drunkedly said \"When are you gonna ask K out?\" Everyone there agreed, even people who were completely sober. Alongside this time were other occasions similar: Me, K, her friend and my friend were in a study session together, until K and her mate left to go somewhere. Then my other friend said to me the second after she left, \"How could you not tell she's heads over heels with you,\" following it up with 'evidence that she did.' All these little occasions continued to happen every now and then over the next three months up until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to this we were extremely close. She would send updates of her day whenever she could, she'd send me voice messages, vent about work or school, send me videos of her most recent shopping hauls, send tiktoks quite often, ask me advice or opinions on what she should buy, and ask if I would go places, most of the time in school for study periods but also outside of school. Her texts were often full of life emotion and passion. When she'd see me in person, she would light up and shiny-ly greet me. We would always joke about when we were with each other and laugh at whatever we said. Our teachers noticed how much we talked, to the point where we had been asked several times to shut up, and they brought it up during parents evenings - she would almost always start these conversations. She also made it somewhat obvious that she wanted to still be close in the future, she asked where I thought I would be going to uni, if I would ever go clubbing with her (she drinks but I don't), and I'm assuming jokingly asking if we would ever go to a country abroad together (we both have a language class together). So so much more but I think thats enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoughts about me and my future have been eating me up inside, thinking that I will live full of regret about the life I live right now. She knows this, because a bit prior to when I asked if she thought of me as more than a friend (I'll get to that later) I talked about how uncomfortable I felt in my own skin, how I find it so hard to exercise properly because everything -bones joints etc - hurts, and how I struggled looking at my reflection, because I couldn't stand how skinny I, especially my arms, was. She was so nice and understanding, saying that she'll be there for me and saying really nice things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another regret I had in my mind was that what if she really DID like me, like my friends (including one of her old mates - they had a bit of a disagreement a while back) said before. This was eating me up inside, I didn't want to feel like i missed a chance of being with her in the future especially if we would still be friends, because what can you do with an expired crush? It's not like I particularly wanted her to say yes, I just wanted us to still be close no matter what.\n",

After this she responded within a couple minutes with a pretty dry response to the point were a convo was not salvageable in the slightest, and then turned off her location on snapmaps.

      "Body text: I've been seeing my FWB/situationship for almost 2 years now, we matched on Hinge back in late 2023 and basically things got physical within the first few encounters. It was purely casual at the beginning (more enforced on my end since I wasn't ready for anything serious, although I'm pretty certain she would've said yes to a relationship) and we only saw each other once a month, to prevent either of us from developing too much feelings for one another, and also gives each other time to go out on dates with other people and explore (since we were both in our early-mid 20s and shouldn't just settle for one another so soon). I was also her first, since she was a virgin when I met her, so I didn't want to pin her down and prevent her from truly exploring her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inevitably, we ended up seeing each other once a week and acted more like a couple and feelings grew for both of us. Whilst I absolutely adore and love her who she is a person, I believe our lifestyles to be very different along with a few other dealbreakers that have always prevented me from seeing her as a true romantic partner. It's a sad reality, but these are just my true feelings. I've tried brute-forcing romantic feelings for her and attempted to try something more exclusive/relationship-like, but I simply couldn't do it, no matter how great the physical intimacy was between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that all said and done, now fast forward to present day 2025, we haven't seen each other in months as I simply could not give her what she wanted - which is ultimately a relationship. We decided to call it quits whilst she pursues something more concrete, which I totally respect. I still hold lots of love for her as a true friend, and I would very much like to keep in contact with her even as friends, but a part of me understands that it might simply be impossible. We are so physically attracted to one another, we basically jump on each other whenever we are together, I believe the physical chemistry and intimacy is too high for us to ever just be \"friends\" at a true platonic level. But god I just miss our conversations and I really want to reach out, even if it is just for a coffee. But a part of me believes that she won't be able to truly move on if I'm still in the picture. And if she does find herself a boyfriend, it would be inappropriate for us to be talking anyway. Are situationships just all doomed to end as strangers?\n",

      "Body text: We've been together for 4 years. Me (22F),  and my boyfriend (22M) both work. I have my own job and company, he has his own job, but it's not going very well for him. He also works at his cousins firm, almost for free. Maybe 700€. As soon as it doesn't go as he planned, and if it goes badly for a week or two, he immediately wants to give up and has been like that for 2 years now. He said there's no progress because he can't stop thinking negatively about himself and that he won't succeed.\n",

      "I would really like to move in with him, to live together. Because it's always easier for us when we're together and maybe that would solve the problems if his business wasn't going well because he wouldn't have so much stress. At first, that was an option, to move into an apartment, but as soon as he tasted his first money, he immediately said he was going to build a house. At first, the plan was to move into an apartment, then buy an apartment, now he wants to build a house. I said that I don't care where we live, as long as I'm with him.

      "Body text: So this is kind of long but I’m honestly just searching for some words of wisdom from peoples own experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’m 28M and I’ve been with my gf (28F) now for 2 1/2 years. She’s amazing. I love everything about her, we understand each other on some of the deepest levels and on top of that she’s down right my best friend. I’d do anything to support her and I feel we have very strong communication in our relationship so I’ve brought this up before. She suffers from depression and because of that takes Wellbutrin. Even tho from what I’ve read that’s “one of the better ones to be on”, it not only kills her libido but her wanting to be intimate in almost any way. We still kiss and hug but I feel as if I’m almost always the one initiating any kind of intimacy. We use to have sex often (atleast once/twice a week) but over time it’s dwindled down to maybe once a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago or more (when this started happening) she got switched to a bigger dose once a day, instead of that number halved, twice a day. Since then it’s as I said, I feel like I’m the only one really trying for anything. We’ve talked about it on multiple occasions and she tells me she feels guilty, she doesn’t want to let me down and make me feel unappreciated but at the same time there isn’t much effort in “being more involved” per say. I don’t suffer from depression like she does so it’s genuinely hard for me to deeply understand the perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our last conversation about it two weeks ago she has switched back to the twice a day, and has told me that overall she does feel much better and generally less anxious. (From my understanding the dose she was on has a side effect of being anxious and over stimulated easily.) That being said, I feel as though I’m playing a waiting game with no foreseeable end to it. I’m not expecting to have sex every day or anything but I crave physical affection to some degree and I’m just not getting it nearly enough, if at all some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve lately felt the impulses to fill those physical desires but I’ve never cheated nor do I want to start. I’m consciously aware of the impact that would have and it’s not worth it. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t make her be more physical with me nor do I want to push it. I want to be chased to some degree and feel as though I’m wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR I’m really asking what I should do. I’m waiting and being as patient as I can but any person can only keep their mental fortitude in check for so long. I absolutely love this girl so I’m trying my best, I guess I just feel the lack of answers, the unknown, is shaking me.\n",

      "I(20f) and my bf(22m) have been dating for almost 1,5 years. Lately I've noticed issues that i never though would come up in this relationship. Some examples:\n",
      "1. I feel like I'm doing the emotional labor of everything(what's for dinner, what do we need from the store, should the dishes be washed today or tomorrow, we need to be there by 10 so we have to leave by 9:30 so we need to get up at 8:30 etcetera). My bf knows I'm on top of stuff, because I'm am anxious person and need proper plans. But lately feels like he won't do anything. We've talked about it and it gets better for a while but then slowly goes back to the way it was. His usual excuse is \"i don't know how\" or \"my brain isn't working rn I can't just come up with dinner ideas like you can\". I feel like I'm dating a child in some aspects\n",
      "2. I'm a student(have been for our whole relationship) and he works 40h/week. When I complained about me doing a lot more of the chores at home, he brought up that given I'm home more often I have more time to do chores. I do school remotely and my schedule is pretty chill, but because we pay everything 50/50 I feel like I shouldn't be treated like a stay at home mom... \n",
      "3. Whenever we have free time (weekends & evenings) we always do what he likes to do. He says it's because \"you know me I just can't sit still, I have many things I'm passionate about and have a lot of hobby projects\". Whereas I don't really have hobbies and the ones I do have he is not interested in joining. I've brought this up to him and he promised to me that we will do more of the stuff I like, but so far that has not been happening.\n",
      "4. No dates, despite me asking for them and trying to plan something. Our plans always fall off because he has something else he wants to do or he claims \"I don't have the money\", (he makes almost double to what I make, and somehow he is the one who is poor).\n",
      "5. I don't feel emotionally close to him anymore. I love him, but sometimes I feel like I don't like him. He is amazing and wonderful most of the time, but sometimes I feel like he doesn't appreciate me. \n",
      "6. This happened last night and it made me doubt everything. My bf had been hanging out with his friend, they drank a couple if beers and I picked him up at around midnight. A bit of background info: I have depression, it's under control but sometimes I just feel bad for no reason. When I picked him up my bf noticed something was wrong, but he kept asking if I was mad or annoyed at him. I wasn't and I told him as much. I should have just said thay I'm sad, but I have a hard time stating my feel ones in fear that the other person will get mad(childhood trauma, not related to him, he never gets mad at me). \n",
      "When we went to sleep I was still feeling bad but hadn't told him what was wrong. My bf fell asleep and I tried to sleep too, but everything just came crashing down and I started uncontrollably crying. I woke my bf up and he hugged me and asked what was wrong, but I couldn't speek due to the sobbing. Then after I noticed that he had been quiet for a few minutes while I cried I looked up and he was SLEEPING. My bf fell asleep while I was scream crying on his chest.. I talked to him about it this morning and he just said that he tried to stay awake but couldn't help it, but I feel like no matter how tired you are you should be able to stay awake when your gf is in need of comforting. \n",

      "There are a lot of little things that are piling up and I don't know what to do. I don't want to brake up with him because I love him and can still see a bright future ahead of us, but I feel like something needs to change. Any advice how I could bring this up to him without it feeling like I'm blaming him?  I know I also have flaws so I don't want to just blame him about our issues.

      "Body text: I am a 24 year old male and have been together with my Girlfriend 25 years old female for nearly 2 years. The relationship started good but after like half a year it slowly stopped being that. I was always loving and caring for her but she bites me, punches me and rubs my muscles against my bones whenever I did something wrong or she doesn't like. (She has mental health problem with ADHD and Borderline) I was also always there for her daughter (now 5 years old) and we had an to early child together (he will be 1 year old next month) that we care for with all our heart but I needed to move away because of mental health problems that are coming because of her. I always get the blame for everything no matter what it was and she always says I am not helping even though I am helping as much as I a mentally can or rather could. We now are in a long Rang relationship but I fell better when I am not with her because when I am visiting her because of my son (her daughter is not mine) she is acting like I was never gone. And also I am someone who loves to cuddle or a little intimate time but she only gets that Feeling when its about marriage or for making a child. She teases me and then let's me fall with all that emotion that has build up inside me. There is also a thing with her Ex boyfriend that one or rather all of them where never good to her but she wants me to do the same thing like they did and one of the r...ed and nearly punched her to dea.. and she wants me to basically do the same thing when \"I want her\" but she also says she would get Defensive and she already made me bleed with scratching and stabbing (not with a knife) and when she is with her girlfriends she starts to flirt with them and even told me she would jump with them into bed.

      "Title: Is it normal for me (21F) to feel unsure about a serious relationship in college with my boyfriend (22M) , even when everything seems “perfect”\n",
      "Body text: So me and my boyfriend have been dating a little less than two years and my boyfriend has a complete disinterest in knowing about my past because he would rather not know due to how jealous he can get. Therefore, we both haven’t discussed much about our pasts, aside from me knowing about his two ex-girlfriends. To note, I want to add that I met my boyfriend at his fraternity, and I didn’t want to seem inexperienced, so I lied about having boyfriends when I’ve never dated in the past. Huge mistake on my part, I know, but I genuinely didn’t expect to start dating him—as I had only had my first kiss (coincidentally at the same fraternity)—and I just wanted to lose my virginity after growing up in a strict household.\n",
      "\n",
      "So recently, my boyfriend and I had a conversation about his past because I know tidbits here and there from him, his friends, and other people who know things about him, but I just wanted to get the full picture of people, experiences, etc. He started off by telling me the list of people he’s hooked up with (none of whom look like me or share my race), and I also asked him specifically about this one girl with whom I have mutual friends. He also told me to keep anything I had done to myself, as the conversation was really only to satiate my curiosity while he said he would rather stay in the complete dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the issue is—I haven’t had any experiences outside of him, and I have been overall really anxious about our relationship. This is his longest relationship and my first and only serious one. He and I have discussed getting married on numerous occasions, and he believes he’s never been in love like he has with me. He was also the first to say “I love you,” while I took another month to say it back. Looking back, I think I just said it to not hurt his feelings by taking too long, but I don’t think I was entirely sure about my feelings then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I obviously do love him very much, but I’m stuck with this retroactive jealousy that is sitting in the pit of my stomach. I can’t help but feel that if I hadn’t enwrapped myself in a serious relationship so early into my college experience, I wouldn’t be feeling this way. I selfishly wish I got to have a similar level of experiences. I know it’s unreasonable, but it hurt a little to hear that he remembered having sex with another girl in his new apartment bed after I had agreed to lose my virginity there—because he had told me he hadn’t slept with anyone there yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it’s really silly, but I had only started to “glow up” in my appearance a couple of months before we started dating, because it took me a while to acclimate to college and change my wardrobe—away from what was dictated by my strict parents. I never wanted to jump into a serious relationship and assumed ours wouldn’t last long. But now I’m at the stage where I may be spending the rest of my life with a boy I met at 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I should feel really lucky—as my friends tell me—but the retroactive jealousy and the feeling that my life has been determined for me (at least in the romance aspect) while I’m still in the process of becoming a real adult is unnerving. I’m graduating soon while he will be in college for another year, and while I love him very much, I don’t know how to be in a relationship beyond the college bubble or how to really determine if this is my soulmate, outside of how much I love him—because I feel like I have nothing to compare it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do hold so much love and appreciation for him, and I think a lot of my sureness in the relationship comes from him expressing to me, on multiple occasions, that he believes I am his future wife. But I don’t know if I also really believe that—or if I’ve been made to believe it by him and all my friends who think he’s great. I’m not sure if I’m making any sense, because he is great to me—but I feel like my whole college experience has been dominated by him, and I don’t know what that means for my future, or if I want to make space for him for the rest of my 20s and beyond, when I’m still unsure of what I’m going to be doing or where I’m headed.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "My boyfriend and I haven’t shared much about our pasts due to his jealousy, but I recently learned more about his sexual history, which triggered retroactive jealousy for me—especially since I lied early on about having past relationships when I had none. He’s my first and only serious relationship, and while he deeply loves me and talks about marriage, I’m unsure if I truly feel the same or if I’ve just grown into this relationship because it started so early in college. I’m graduating soon while he has another year, and I’m conflicted about what my future should look like. I love him, but I don’t know if I’m choosing this relationship or if it’s just chosen me by circumstance.\n",

Theres always something keeping us from hanging out and his texting style has changed, he talks more like his male friend than himself and he doesn't tell me he loves me as much and he's never lovey to me. i don't know whats up. i've tried expressing how i feel to him multiple times and he apologizes and makes it seem like i'm going to see some change yet i never do. he says he doesn't know whats wrong with him and i'm trying to be as patient as i can but i don't know if i can be in a relationship where he doesn't seem to care for me. Please help, What can I do, id love for this relationship to work out. so is there anyway i can maybe help him? im trying to be as supportive as i possibly can because i know he's better than how he is right now he just has these odd phases? i guess i could call them. please help, anything appreciated!! <3\n",

      "Myself (26F) and my partner (26M) have gone away for our 10th year anniversary. He has been going through a lot lately  and I  havent pressed him,  but yesterday he asks my why I don't trust him after 10 years. He's extremely hurt, says his mental health has taken a beating for it, and I completely understand. I have extremely anxious moments / periods where I put a lot on him, he's always shown up for it / me. But now it's all culminated into too much - I've been so afraid of this happening but now it's at the point where he doesn't know if he can stay. He's exhausted and I really do get it, but I want to work on it. I have booked in therapy starting next week and encouraged him to do the same, he says he will but I'm worried he's already mentally tapped out.\n",
      "Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this? I want to do better for him and support him as best I can - firstly starting with taking majority of my baggage to the therapist to ease  the load on him.\n",

      "We have been through many things growing up, the relationship has been fine and decent. Except I feel like I have put up with a lot on his end, and gone above and beyond on my own end, and do not feel at the very least appreciated for it.   \n",

      "What has been happening lately: He started his 1L year of law school, I am finishing up undergrad and going to med school soon. We both live 15 mins away from each other. Going to grad school in same city. Seems all perfect and ideal. Except: When it comes to stressful times, and he feels like he is on the urge of suicide because of stress, I am there to support him undoubtedly. Even with my busy schedule, classes, work, gym, typical life stuff of the fall semester. I made time to cook him meals and go to his grad school to give him words of encouragement, massages, and kisses. And tackle his future plans and his racing thoughts. We never went on dates, he never really spent money on me, but i thought that was okay because he was going through grad school first and adjusting and I could be there for him for more support. The same thing happened in the spring semester, with me on the back burner. Now he finished his 1L year, he finished applications, he secured a summer job, he has been succeeding and I am so happy for it because I made sure to be his peace and help him along the way with lots of love and support. Even during his finals he maybe texted me less than 4 times a day and we couldn't really see each other because he was studying. I never held it against him.   \n",

      "Now (literally today) I have been going through intense exam studying this summer where I feel so overwhelmed and like I have no time for myself. I still make the effort to see him when I can and give my most loving and positive self. But i think what broke me is when i explained my struggles that I would like help and support too, and he was not accepting of it. I have cried because of studying in the library for 10 hours and wanting some love and support or kind words. But he simply will not give me any and won't initiate trying to soothe me or calm me down or tackle my problems, or talk things out with me. Like i am not expecting him to buy me anything, all i want is him to be present during my struggles and tough times. And it hurts even more because i go out of my way to do special things for him, TMI but i even buy sexy lingerie and surprise him with it, trying to soothe him and make him feel better. and then when it comes to supporting me emotionally, or even satisfying me sexually he just simply wont (and when he wants sex, i give it to him, because ofc i want to please him). he acts all tired and entitled, and tells me what i am doing is normal. but to me it feels one-sided. and i feel like through the amount of hardships i go through he is not there to help me or love me. all of this seems like a clear sign that he does not care about my wellbeing or me as a person,   \n",
      "  \n",
      "but when his friends show interest in me, or other men show interest in me, he becomes full blown defensive and then tries to \"protect\" me as much as he can and explains how none of them will love me or admire me as much as him. but i simply do not see it, so i cannot trust his sweet words at times. i just feel like i am a good partner and girlfriend to him, not only during tough times, but i try to make the sweet times even sweeter. i always make sure to respect and not embarrass him, keep my distance with men pursuing me, always behave and dress modestly (all things i learned from my parents). i respect and love him so i behave that same way and want to as well. i do not ask him for anything, all i ask is for a loving and supporting partner, to at least reciprocate what i give. but i have received nothing during this really hard time and i feel alone and undervalued. i cannot continue to be strong everyday of my life for the end of time, i want to at times rely on my partner, isn't that what a man is for? any advice would help me, i have no idea what to expect from a partner, he has been my only long term real relationship. thank you everyone.  \n",

      "I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for 3 years. I’ve supported him selflessly through the stress of law school—cooked for him, gave him massages, surprised him with lingerie, listened to his racing thoughts, and never expected gifts or fancy dates in return. But now that I’m overwhelmed with studying for med school exams, he gives me nothing back—no comfort, no emotional support, barely even kind words. Sex also feels one-sided: I always make sure he’s satisfied, but he rarely puts in effort to satisfy me. I feel like I’m his emotional rock, but when I need support, he’s absent. He only shows concern when other men are interested in me, but otherwise, I feel undervalued and alone. I don’t know what’s normal in a relationship—this is my first serious one—but I’m exhausted being the only one giving.\n",

      "Body text: First, we are in a distance relationship. Although we were close in high school and kept in touch over the years, we’ve only been dating for about five months now. A couple weeks ago, I began to see this guy in her pictures, and she would mention this friend in some conversations. Now I’m not saying she can’t have friends. My worry however, is how close they seem to have become. From what I’ve seen and heard through her, they’ve been gone out to eat multiple times, and I see that they go on trips to the park together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand these are normal activities. And for what it matters, I’m certain he’s a fair bit older than her. I do not know for certain just how old, she hasn’t told me his age, although I haven’t actually asked her that yet either. From what I understand, she visits him multiple nights a week, which she drives the distance. It’s not within the town. I may be hesitant to ask about him, but from what I have already, she’s told me little because she “wants to keep her friends private”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel I should also make clear, she’s really hasn’t given me many legitimate worries. I overthink, and I understand that clouds my judgment. I trust that she won’t do anything foolish. She doesn’t hide that she hangs out with him, I always know if it’s him that she’s with, and she doesn’t act defensive or try to hide anything about who she’s with. She hasn’t acted “distant”, or stopped being as affectionate. It’s not like she’s stopped telling me she loves me and whatnot. It’s just how often she’s with him that gets me, and makes me worry about what could potentially happen. I would say I worry more about him than her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I call her some nights, about various things, and some of these calls have been during her ride there, or when she’s already been there. One night she was getting ready to drive there, one night she was at his house already, more recently when she was waiting for him to get home from work to then go see him. And just earlier this evening, she told me she was going to eat with him tonight. Whether it’s at his house, or out at a restaurant I’m not certain, I didn’t ask.\n",

      "I want to know if these are valid, and how to let her know of my concerns. The best way to go about asking her about him, and what she does with him. I totally understand if these points make no sense, as I overthink about these things, and that I probably have no need to worry. I do trust her, I’m not going to outright claim that I think she’s trying to bang this guy. I apologize if there’s any information I left out that would’ve been needed, or if I shared anything unnecessary.\n",

      "Before we parted ways we set aside a few days to spend together. On one of these days she opened my Snapchat and saw I had a 2-day old message from a girl, we’ll call her Anna. I explained that Anna was a good friend of my since 8th grade, we were part of the same friend group, and that we are close friends (I don’t have many friends so the ones I do have are close). Initially this seemed to raise some alarm bells, and she said she felt a little threatened. But I assured her there was nothing to worry about. I went on to explain to her that Anna had texted me asking if I’d like to come to a festival with here that weekend, I replied and explained I would be with my gf and would unavailable that weekend. This explanation probably didn’t make things better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward two weeks and my gf brings it up again via text. She said she finds it odd that there is a girl I’m “close friends with” and I hadn’t brought her up to my gf, and furthermore I text her on Snapchat where things delete (this isn’t intentional, this is just how we and the rest of our friend group tends to communicate), and all of it just seems suspicious on my part. She went on to say that this sort of thing is a sore spot for her (her parents had issues with infidelity, and I know this). When things like this come up she questions whether she is wasting her time, and how much I trust/value her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She goes on to say that she deserves to know of this kind of thing, not to find out on her own, and that when she tried to talk about it in person I got defensive about it (I honestly don’t remember my reaction, I remember trying to diffuse any concerns she may have had). This sort of thing causes her pain because of things that have happened in her family (feeling she can’t trust certain people), and my not seeing that is misunderstanding her and she feels as if I don’t know her completely.\n",

      "The reason I didn’t communicate any of this is because I don’t feel the need to, I applied the golden rule. It was the sort of thing where if the roles were reversed I wouldn’t feel it necessary for my gf to tell me this stuff, and I don’t feel I would be concerned if I found out either. However, if a girl I was previously involved with started talking to me again, asking to get together, etc., that would be cause for concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I felt really hurt by things she said because I trust and value her immensely. In that moment I felt the love I had shown her was unappreciated and forgotten. At the end of the day I unintentionally hurt her and that brought up an emotional injury inflicted on her by someone else, and now that pain is being projected on to me (I don’t think she said those things to intentionally malign me, but because that’s how she felt in the moment).\n",

I ask her if she talks to him a lot and she says no, and I ask her what they talk about and she says me. I thought this was kind of weird but he’s pretty much been asking her “what to do” about me?

My friends also think I say \"I love you\" too much. When I say it to her, she hasn't said it back as much. Maybe once in a blue moon since I noticed the distance.

      "For context, my girlfriend has done it tough. She was abused as a child and fled her home county with her mum at 7. She never felt loved. She never trusted her mother, as she felt she didn’t do enough to protect her as a child. She doesn’t trust her sisters, as she feels looked down on by them because shes been depressed her whole life. She was bullied at school.

I could tell she didn’t like it, but didn’t say anything at the time. These things happen often. I try to be gentle. But she grasps onto these moments and turns it into an instance of me being horrible.\n",

We were out with my parents and vibes were good, but for some stupid reason (I blame this on my adhd, maybe that’s just an excuse tho) I flicked a lighter in her general direction. I admit it was stupid, but there was no malicious intent whatsoever (obviously). At the time, nothing was said. The next day, it was over. She accused me of trying to set her on fire and said if I can do that, what will I do next. I was distraught. I apologised profusely. I said i was being silly and I know it was unsafe and dumb. After a week, she forgave me. But to this day, she brings it up in moments like this morning, where she says I make her feel unsafe and I’m horrible.\n",

I try to be gentle, but tiny things (eg. putting plastic straws in dishwasher when she has said we shouldn’t) makes her hate me. I don’t know what to do. I love her but nothing makes her happy and I can’t gain her trust. Maybe it’s best to let go and have this conversation in full, as the current situation is miserable. That said, I love her, and am so scared to see her on her own, as she doesn’t have any other support aside from me. I’m stuck. Where do I go from here? Stick it out and hope that one day it all works out? Is there something more I can do? Or is it time to let this all go and prioritise my happiness. Any words of wisdom or advice is welcomed.\n",

      "Me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been dating for a few months now. At the very start of our relationship she was iffy to get in a relationship because she said she had a crush on multiple people, me and this other guy she's friends with online. I didn't see a problem with it as she's never even met him and I see her almost every day, she choose me. Now she's hiding her phone constantly. At the start right before we were official she had the MyLove app and it said she was in a relationship with someone for like 2 months I asked her about it and she said she forgot to delete it. I believed her. Now she's been very secretive about her discord. She doesn't know but I snooped a tiny bit and she STILL has the MyLove app with the same guy on there. My name in her phone is just my name but in her phone he is labeled \"My Mute <3\" what the hell. I've never been cheated on but that's clearly what it is right? The worst part is we have a mostly good relationship and we love each other, she wears my shirt, constantly mentions how I'm her boyfriend. I don't know what to do. My best friend has left for basic training until August and I literally have nobody else to talk to about it. I'm lonely as hell and that's part of why I can't break up with her. She's all I have now, I'm slowly realizing just how little friends I have. Another issue is my drive. My needs aren't being met for sexual  things, we never have, we talked about it a bit, but I need more and I feel disgusted for thinking these things. She isn't ready and I won't push her at all but our relationship is more like friendship and less like a relationship, usually I'd have something casual, we'd flirt, make dirty comments, it's fun, I want that but I can't push her. I seriously don't know what to do. The logical thing would be to break up with her but I literally have no other close friends to hang out with, I'm lonely enough as it is. Please I need advise.\n",

Being spontaneous and what not, is something I never felt like I could do in a relationship without worrying him which only worried me.

      "Body text: Hello Everyone! I am new to reddit so please let me know which subreddits this is relevant to. I 27M broke up with my gf 27F 1 year ago. We had been together for some time and even long distance and had planned to marry. She has had a pattern to put herself first which led to us having some fights in the past. She is the girl I have felt the most comfortable and disappointed at the same time. She understands me and has a similiar sense of humor to me but her tendency to become a victim has put me off. She has broken up with me twice in the past and blindsided me both times. I asked her to reconsider to which she did and regretted and we moved on together afterwards. I told her that I felt dissatisfied with our relationship and put in some work in therapy and my life for us to have a smooth future together. I asked her for a break in the meantime. During the break I came to realize how uncomfortable she made me every time she complained and put herself first. I let her know my disagreements and what made me unhappy but all she did was make herself the victim again. I tried to give her chances but she didnt go to therapy as I asked her or pledge to do what was needed to save the relationships. (she did say once she didnt know what to do but I felt I told her so many times what to do that I felt unheard and angry at her) In a heated moment I broke up with her. That was 1 year ago. I have been busy with life and stuff so I haven't taken a moment to process everything and move on. I know I am technically single but just havent taken the time to fully process what happened so I can look at another girl with full heart without thinking of her. I messaged her about 1.5 months ago. I used 2 different social media channels as both I and her blocked each other on our main whatsapp after the breakup. I think she saw one message where I asked her to talk (explaining i am not looking for closure) and blocked me on that platform. But I dont know if she saw the message on the other platform. I told her that i want to move on and if she has went to therapy and feels different about our relationship then we can retry, otherwise I wished her good luck. Since I know she has blocked me, should i move on? I feel that I want to move forward in my life but I am simultaneously angry at her for constantly playing the victim. I want to be a good guy and give her an opportunity to explain herself or be tolerant and let her space to speak but I feel very angry at her behavior. She is being so flaky that its just hard to depend on her and for us to not fight. How do I move on from here? Should I just move on?\n",

Previous I never really bothered about her but when I found out about this, I GOT VERY UPSET because he got close to the likes of her, when I Confronted him he lied to me and hid her chats, I knew it and found it, turns out he was talking to her about how tough it is for him and me about the breakup and basically throwing a pity party and she encouraged him to break up with me. She also talked shit about my girls. Obviously I was very upset, suddenly he turned cold and asked me why should I bother, we broke up anyways after that he basically maintained distance with me. I was upset because I wanted to go through this together and technically he was right about us not being together, but my heart still held on. I was quite desperate but was slowly healing and when I was about to move on.

I'm happy and I love him me so much,  hes clean, thoughtful, and very sweet and kind. Never been mean or raised his voice. I just unsure, the only issue i have with the relationship is the sex. I rarely get off and i don't hate the sex but don't love it either it just kinda sucks and feels like a chore. But that's the only big issue that's ongoing. Hes good with money so thats not a worry if we move in together,  he can cook and clean and such. Ive lived on my own for years and im currently in a iffy living situation, i have multiple roommates but they are usually okay but i do want to move out though. I just need help and advice on this, I'm not being abused and we don't have passwords to eachother phones or anything i trust him and he trusts me. We usually see eachother once a week as he works away. Sometimes its once every 2 weeks and it's always a couple days. I'm sorry this is all over the place, I'm not sure what to do.

Well, that's good, but she has grown a anxious attachment to me, even if for a small amount of time, I want to be left alone or go somwhere alone, she gets too anxious and starts getting angry as if I am leaving her.

I have tried telling her and explaining it to her that I just need some alone time, some days off, some time to myself, bt she takes it in a negative way and makes me the villain, assumes that she is irritating me or she is being an obstruction in my life. I never meant it that way,  I being a single child have always grown up wih just my mom and dad, and always had a fair share of alone time and I enjoy it really. Even, when we are back from college on vacations, I talk to her on phone regularly, and even after a call of about 1 hours, when I say I need to go(yes, I am close to my parents a lot), she gets angry amd makes a fuss that I am leaving, or I don't want to talk to her. Even once when my mom came while talking to her, she just cut the call and later said she didn't want to disturb me, although I said my mom knows about you, and she just was calling me for lunch.

After emigrating, we started talking more, and a few months ago we moved in together. It was mostly a forced decision: he lost his job, and I offered him to stay with me.\n",

      "He didn’t sleep at night, was in the living room with his laptop. I woke up a couple of times during the night, and around 6 AM I saw he was starting to fall asleep. I suggested he move to the bedroom so he could rest better, since I would need to use the kitchen (which is combined with the living room).\n",
      "He came to the bedroom with his laptop. On his nightstand there was a hairdryer and a bottle of grooming spray for the dog — I had used it earlier in the day while bathing his dog. He removed the hairdryer and dropped the bottle to the floor to make space for the laptop. I asked him to please put the bottle on my nightstand instead, because it leaks, and handed it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, he started saying that I never clean up after myself and raised his voice. He said I’m manipulative, that my care is fake, that I pressure him, and that I should have removed the bottle earlier. I asked if he had talked to any friends about moving in with them since I clearly annoy him so much. He asked if I wanted him to leave. I said no — there are things I like about living together — but if it’s this hard for him, I can’t live in constant tension. I suggested joint therapy. He refused and said the problem is mine, not his, and that I need therapy to learn how to communicate. He’s been in individual therapy for years. Then he got angry, grabbed his dog, and went outside for a walk — at 6 AM. He came back after about 15–20 minutes.\n",

      "Later that day, I suggested we go for a walk together, but said I wasn’t ready to continue the earlier conversation. He sarcastically asked why.\n",

We met naturally in university and she fell in love with me, showering me with affection and taking care of me, and I did the same. We were each others first relationship, we’d talked to others before but nothing ever worked out. We checked each other’s phones at times, and for her, there were no guys in her phone and she was repulsed at the idea of being with another guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past week contact became sporadic and she blamed her lack of texting on the fact that her parents were pressuring her to find a boyfriend from the same cultural background (I’m a different race). This was due to the fact that we had discussed that we wanted to get married and saw a future in our relationship. She also said her lack of contact was due to “family issues.” We spoke three days ago and she said that she was stressed and didn’t know what to do, and did not want to break up but hated feeling pressure from her mum. I also once during the relationship was invited to her place to have dinner with her folks and everything went well, which led me to think that maybe her folks did like me after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "After not hearing from her for another 2-3 days I was sent a photo of her with another guy. She had her fingers on the side of his face. My heart dropped, and in the next days I spoke with her about it to which she said that the reason she drove to see him was because he was a family friend and she had errands to run in that area anyway. She also repeatedly said that when they hung out it was purely platonic and the photo of them together did not have any significance and that she was actually uncomfortable with him taking photos of her. She also stated that she was playing with his younger siblings and him and scratched something off his face. He happened to also be the same race as her. I don’t think she’s the type to cheat but I never can know. \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, her friends have told me she didn’t know if we had broken up or not when this incident occurred. Because she told me she needed space beforehand, and that to her meant that we were over. But to me, I just thought that it meant that she needed some\n",

      "I do also want to clarify that after I found out about this incident that happened I also wanted to come clean about something I had done during the relationship. I had invited a female coworker (friend) over to my house to have a conversation and catch up. this was not a date or planned out in advance. I also did not know that she had feelings for me. However, towards the end of the interaction, when she told me she had feelings and wanted to hang out again I immediately shut it down, as I am not a cheater. however I told my girlfriend as I felt like I made a mistake by hiding this interaction from her in the first place, although it was nothing that crossed any boundaries we had set. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’ve asked her friends how’s she’s doing to which they say she’s okay, struggled (was crying) in the first couple days but is okay. I still miss her more than anything, can’t eat, sleep, or function the same. I workout and train jiu jitsu and work on my business to distract myself but I truly cannot live. I have this constant pit in my stomach and am socially off since this incident occurred. I’ve never had any mental or physical health problems before but I had my first proper panic attack when this news was delivered to me and haven’t been the same since. \n",

      "Body text: I 19(M) is currently in a situation with my (18) gf. For short context we have been together for about 4 going on 5 months now. I'm currently in a situation where my gf was invited to her friend's Airbnb. Not big on the party stuff out of respect for her, but it's her friend and I don't wanna be that controlling bf. We have had numerous conversations about communication while being in that type of setting in which she failed to do so this weekend. This was a 2 night even in which she stayed the night saturday night. I wasn't too pushy Friday night, as she was reassuring me, but came to find out that all communication stopped after she \"fell asleep\". It just doesn't add up how you fall asleep at a friend's event but ok cool. Saturday morning, we talk and she apologizes and says she will communicate better which is all I ask of her to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come Saturday night, I feel like our conversation has completely gone out the window, as she confirmed she was up but gone hours without a text nor some type of reassurance. I'm sure this all ties down into my trust in her, but it genuinely got worse. Sunday morning she wakes me up still a bit drunk/ hungover from last night telling me she's sorry and what not, which I'm honestly not buying because yesterday was her prime chance to show me your sorry for Friday night prior. Before I hung up I caught that she called me another guy's name who ended up being at the Airbnb. I did a bit of digging and he is my gf's friend's friend. Now I end up calling back which I regret now but it just gets worse. She's now in the room with the rest of her friends having a girl talk but it's like she completely forgot I existed and was on the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like by now I know my gfs voice and can point out when she's talking vs when she's not. I went on mute and wrote down everything I heard. 1 My gf had they guys hoodie on, so they were together at some point that night. 2, I vividly heard her say she cheats on me, and I'm going to continue to talk to her which absolutely blew my mind. 3 I overheard her say to a friend \"how did you get caught cheating\" which in my head implies she does it and I haven't caught on. So all this alone just makes me feel like she doesn't even respect me nor love me because how could you possibly act or say that with friends. To add on, her and I had a conversation a while ago, and she said out of her mouth that her best friend is the grimiest girl she knows. So who am I to think shes not doing the same. Birds of a feather flock together. Now if I'm gonna be honest there is way more to this situation but all this alone gives me the ok to just leave and disappear. But I'm still hurt and I want to hear her side. I feel like this is completely stupid because what could she say to get herself out of this situation other than play victim or flip this situation on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top this whole thing off, after she got home, I asked if we could talk in person in which she agreed. I watched with my own eyes her location drops a friend off passing my house and go back home in which I haven't heard from her since at the time of writing this. I truly don't understand how you leave your house to drop a friend home then end up back home. I'm sure she's sleeping because I haven't heard from her in hours. I honestly don’t know what to do right now and I feel like I'm stuck, well at least my heart is.\n",

      "Body text: My 25F boyfriend 33M is a die hard carnivore and I’m vegetarian. Now I don’t care that he eats meat. My whole family does. Most my friends do. It’s never been a dating perimeter or even preference for me before. But this boyfriend is an extreme carnivore. He needs meat with every meal so we literally eat nothing the same. It wasn’t super bothersome at first but it is getting a bit annoying. Even with things like oatmeal, he puts sausage, butter, and raw milk in his. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also gets takeout probably 5 times a week which I think it excessive, expensive, and unhealthy. I stopped saying anything to him about this anymore. It’s his money, his health, fine, whatever. He has said 1x a week many times and never does that. So I stopped saying anything. He does this because he says we have “no food” at our apartment— of course we have A TON of food but his meat is too frozen and he won’t buy any pantry or freezer staples. Legit will not buy. He also thinks his takeout of burger and fries fast food is health. How fast food burger or fries or chicken nuggets are healthier than frozen ones (which he won’t buy bc unhealthy) is beyond me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to my next point of he also thinks he eats healthy which I wholeheartedly disagree with but don’t even say anything anymore because what’s the point. But that’s a problem. Besides the meat, he does raw milk, unpasteurized cheese, thinks spinach is bad for you, compared my no sugar added instant oatmeal to glazed donuts…. just a few examples. Now this in and of itself is not a dealbreaker but it does worry me with kids in the future how much we disagree on diet and food. We eat totally opposite diets. I am not opposed to my kid eating meat (though not my preference) but not all the time and certainly not saturated in butter and beef tallow. I’m not making chicken nuggets from scratch either. \n",
      "\n",
      "He has other beliefs like not using sunscreen, no bleach or any chemicals (fair to an extent), anti-plastic (fair but his aversion is VERY extreme), cotton only materials, etc. Some we would fight but could princely compromise on. But things like sunscreen? Hell no. They WILL be wearing sunscreen. I’m worried we will fight a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will acknowledge he is not wrong in *most* of these opinions but these are his opinions and not objective facts (though many in the minority) and I have different opinions which worry me for the future how we will parent. He views his opinions as objective though. I firmly believe in sunscreen, no raw, etc as do many doctors which will agree with me but he doesn’t think doctors know everything. He doesn’t think I eat healthy and I would say I eat very healthy. We have very different definitions of “healthy” I suppose. It does bug me I can acknowledge his subjective stance of food is valid (kind of) and he invalidates mine. \n",

      "\n",
      "But i'm noticing that instead of him maybe being inspired to improve his lifestyle (he says he wants to, he just struggles doing anything about it), it's more often than not the opposite - i end up caving in and partaking in his bad habits (junk food, soft drinks, etc.). He has bad sleeping habits (staying up late), but i have a generally very organized schedule that i often end up tailoring for him (talking with him late into the night, or partying with his friends - he has a big friend and family circle, there's always some party or other).\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR: My brother is socially inept and narcissistic. Can I stay no contact or am I making the situation worse for myself in the long run?\n",
      "\n",
      "I, 37-year-old woman, have a distant relationship with my 40-year-old brother. He is likely on the autism spectrum, but comes across as entitled, disinterested, and pretty narcissistic. We have never been close. We primarily text to stay in contact, and it’s pretty infrequent. Even with our infrequent contact, he will periodically and suddenly stop texting or engaging in the conversation if he feels slighted or annoyed by how I’ve responded to him. The sudden disengagement is confusing, angering, and hurtful to me. He is always who initiates conversation, but his initiatives rarely include an inquiry about me/my life and, instead, are random memes or photos of his young daughter. It feels very one-sided, as if I’m expected to delight in his world while he offers no interest in mine. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this last incident of his suddenly ceasing contact, I decided I needed to stop engaging. This was six weeks ago. Since then, I have received two texts from him, one about four weeks ago claiming he “completely missed” the last text I sent him (a photo of an ultrasound from of my current pregnancy - my first) and one today, another picture of his daughter. I never responded to the text from four weeks ago; one, because I don’t believe he “completely missed” it (he had told my parents he had intentionally stoped engaging) and, two, because I’m really tired of his self-absorption and lack of ability to relate in any reciprocal or adult way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel conflicted and annoyed about his additional text of the photo today and whether I “should” respond or if I’m just making this situation with him ultimately worse by continuing to not engage. I’m used to being the villain in his eyes; I just want to do whatever I need to to keep the stress and drama at bay - especially while I’m pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I’m tired of his lack of social skills, his sudden disengagements, and his self-absorption and would prefer we just stayed no contact. All efforts to even be in superficial contact have resulted in me feeling resentful because I feel like I’m essentially feeding a tamagotchi (I.e., responding to the photos of his daughter with likes/comments with no expectation of reciprocity), and/or him becoming inexplicably incensed at me and ceasing contact or blowing up.\n",

Recently, I have finally decided on my career path and gone back to school. I realized that my business career was not going how I wanted it to go, so I decided to go into teaching. Its not something that will provide very much, but it is something I have thought of for years. My boyfriend is very passionate about other cultures and wants to travel so he can learn languages and customs. He's said he really wants to be a translator for big companies or a teacher as well. He has severe (and professionally diagnosed) ADHD, depression and social anxiety that makes it very hard for him to commit to things. We have decided on where he should travel to first and talked his plan through, but he has not made the commitment to go through with it. He also has dropped out of multiple family commitments last second because he has felt socially drained. I am not sure if it is because of who I am, but I am having trouble understanding why he is acting this way now. It feels like he's pushing everyone away and just giving up. How do I help him through this? Is there anything I can do other than being a listening ear?

      "Body text: me, f(19) and my girlfriend f(19) had an argument. basically, i have (or now had) this friend that she has been suspicious of. the thing is, i didn't know this until recently, and when she told me i took it seriously and cancelled the plans i had with that friend that day and have been seriously distancing myself. she had made jokes about this friend in the past, which i inquired about because i wanted to know if she really felt this way, to which she said she was only joking. i believed her because this friend had never tried anything with me, seemed happy for my relationship, and would talk about guys she liked with me on multiple occasions. i knew she liked girls, but she never seemed to make a pass at me. it was only after my girlfriend admitted to me that she really did have a feeling about this friend (only off of suspicion because she hadn't done something) that i started thinking if my friend had done some weird things. i took these thoughts to another friend of mine, where i told her my memories of anything that could be strange. for instance, how i first became friends with this girl was simply because she approached me and complimented my style, asking to see a movie. when she said this, i was not with my girlfriend at the time and of course would have mentioned this to her. my friend that i was telling this to explained that this could just be a friendly interaction, but could seem like she was asking me out on a date too. however, when we saw the movie she never tried anything romantic. from there, i started remembering things that i completely forgot, like how i'm pretty sure she asked when i finished class so she could \"accidentally\" bump into me at the bus stop and talk to me. or how she would ask for sleepovers, which i always rejected, and take things in our friendship more seriously than i would, almost as if it were a relationship. she wanted to come visit in my city when i wasn't living in the same place as her, which i was surprised by a little because i didn't think our friendship was so serious. she even asked if she would be allowed to stay in my dorm room with an air mattress, which i rejected because i wouldn't want anyone but my girlfriend staying with me unless it was a very close friend. at the time though, i again just thought she must not be aware that asking that while im in a relationship is odd, not that she was asking on purpose because she liked me. so thats why i just did not encourage the idea and nothing further. she had also asked for my location pretty early into our friendship (for safety reasons she said) but when my location was glitching recently she texted me about it, which i had some thoughts about because none of my other friends have been concerened about my location in that way. i thought, is she watching me? i even told my girlfriend when this friend had texted me about my location saying that i was annoyed she cared so much, to which my girlfriend just agreed with me. at the time though, i didn't think she wanted me, just that she was maybe a bit of a clingy friend. by the way, i have since blocked her from my location.\n",
      "\n",
      "anyways, after having this talk with my other friend who suggested i shouldn't be so trusting this friend is strictly friendly and that my girlfriend could be onto something, i told my girlfriend about this. she got very upset, since she didn't know about all this stuff my friend had did and now she really had a reason to not trust her. i keep trying to reassure her that i seriously did not think bad about it at the time, otherwise i would have immediately cut things off as i have now that i am aware. however i do not think she fully trusts that, and says she doesn't recognize this side of me. i have tried to tell her so much that i only want her, which is of course true, and i wouldn't let anyone get in the way of us. am i horrible for not seeing the signs sooner? or telling her about the things my friend said which made her worry more? i did this because i didn't want to keep anything from her, but it seems like it was the wrong idea. does anyone have advice on the situation?\n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone. Me (M22) and my girlfriend (F21) have been together for 1 year and 2months. We've known each other for 3 years now (met in university, we both study philosophy ) and we used to be best friends and hang out all the time before I helplessy fell in love with her. We always had chemistry and found ways to have fun together, but we are very different people. I am a meditator, very focused on my inner/spiritual aspect, vegetarian and I don't drink while she's more of a materialistic person (doesn't mean she don't have a good heart, she is a beautiful person), loves to eat meat and drink sometimes. But I never cared about these differences. Getting with her was the most painful experience of my life. She never had a serious relationship before and when I started expressing my feelings for her she was very much taking steps back from me. But I could see that she liked me deep down so l kept hoping and we kissed a few times. But it didn't mean anything to her. After the third kiss we had in like 2 months she totally disconnected with me and I had 2/3 months of crying everyday and writing poems for her... it was really painful but taught me much, I never blamed her for not returning the feelings but I was suffering because of the intensity of mines. After five months of this she eventually decided that she wanted to be with me and we got together. I was the happiest man on earth, couldn't believe it (in fact at the beginning I was often in fear that she would leave after sometimes). But things build up and our relationship became stable and loving After 2 sweet months together I went to India for 3 months, got back, seen her for 2 days and then she went for exchange study abroad for 5 months. I went to visit her 2 times (in total like 12 days), things were good even with distance. As time passed she matured and became more loving, caring and sensitive. Then she came back and - after 2months + 7 months at distance relationship, we finally were together in the sane place again. Bu then something happened. I fell in love with my friend's girlfriend. We started seeing each other because we share intrests like music and writing. She used to read my things and give me feedbacks, wich I appreciated very much. But when we (it was almost simultaneous) started realizing we felt something for each other, it was a terrible epiphany. I will not lie and say I had not seen it coming, but i certanly underestimated the possibility. As soon as we sort-of told each other about what was going on she left her boyfriend (they had been together for 3 years and they swear - yes, I talked about this to him too because it's my friend- that there were problems before and I'm not the main reason for their separation) and I ran to my girl and told her I was feeling romantically towards this other person. Nothing happened between us, we sort of cut ties and decided not to see each other again out of respect for our respective partners. My girl was hurt when she heard this, we cried together and I promised that I would be with her if she wanted me to. With thine things got a little calmer and we slowly are trying to rebuild the serenity and trust that was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last month, I’ve been trying my best to be present with my girlfriend, to honor the love we have, and not make rash decisions. But I can’t shake the feeling that we’re on different wavelengths. We’re about to start a long-distance phase for two years due to our studies, and I can’t imagine that future together anymore. I still love her and want the best for her, but I no longer feel I want to walk that path with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part? She’s more in love with me than ever, and committed to us. She started this relationship with more hesitation, and now I’m the one hesitating. I feel like I’m breaking — torn between the fear of hurting her and the truth that staying might hurt us both more in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I think I should just sacrifice my needs to keep her from pain. But then I realize that this wouldn’t make either of us happy. And yet, the idea of letting her go — and truly losing her — destroys me. I know she would need to cut contact to move on. That thought paralyzes me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear: I’m not thinking of leaving her to be with this other girl. Maybe in the back of my head, yes, but I anyway would need much time to be romantically available to someone else and there’s something more fundamental. I haven’t barely seen this other girl for weeks. But she was a catalyst, and through what I felt with her, I saw what was missing in myself and my current relationship.

From my view of it all of this is temporary and I'm sure everything will get better too once they actually move and start their job and school and all that but what scares me is they have made no mention of it ending soon, I've rationalized it in my head as , someone who is deeply off center and super fucked up will find it very hard to see the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" so I'm hoping I can be there however I can and once they get better everything will be okay.\n",

He then got very weird with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways last week we all went out to celebrate and he got really drunk and was all over me at the bar. He asked to go home so I took him home he laid on my couch asked me to lay with him so I did. He put his hand on my butt and I told him to stop because he was really drunk and it felt wrong. He did and ended up sleeping. \n",

      "I did offer to call him an Uber like three times but honestly he was so drunk I’m glad he ended up staying. When I told him everything the next morning he was upset with himself and how he acted. He apologized we talked about it. He is a major over-thinker with bad anxiety so I was trying to make sure he knows it was ok and I was ok. We are both adults who consented to whatever groping was happening. However the more I thought about it the more I was like I feel sort of icky about it. On one hand I’m flattered but on the other hand I’m not ok with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is he not the first guy to publicly grope me in a bar he did it in-front of some of the people we go to school with.So I texted him and he ended up calling me. He has been so nice about my feelings and very much validating them. He admitted that he has been giving me mixed singles and blurred the lines of our friendship. He also admitted that he was hitting on me and called it a botched drunken hookup attempt.  I just feel like I’m only good enough for men who are drunk since this isn’t the first time and I told him that. He then made a comment that has been bothering me so much he said “believe me any guy would be lucky to have you, you are the nicest person I know” it just felt like it was out of pity. He also mentioned how I am more than just my body and if guys are trying to hook up with me it’s not just because of sex. I don’t know my feelings for him but he seems to want to remain friends. I just don’t know if I even want to remain friends I feel used by him. He has other friends who are girls who I don’t think he has ever done this to just me. Do I have another conversation with him do I just move on and pretend it never happened ? We have mutual friends and got to the same school so I can’t avoid him forever. \n",

      "My gf f17 and I m15 have been dating for 8 months and her parents have done everything in their power to force a break up after they found out about the relationship that we kept secret from them. They have separated us and removed anyway for her to contact me. Now I am deeply depressed and scared that I won't ever see my girlfriend again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My GF and I met at an online school in August of last year. We started out as friends and mainly just talked and hung out for about two weeks before I decided to shoot my shot. Unfortunately, I chickened out before I could ask her on a date, but I did end up asking her if she had a crush on anyone and to my surprise she said me. I immediately told her that the crush was reciprocated, and we decided to start dating (asking her out did go as planned but all's well that ends well lol). It was about two days after that when her dad discovered who I was and told her to block me and cut all contact. I should probably mention that her parents didn't care about her privacy and regularly went through her text messages. From then on she kept our relationship a secret from her parents. \n",
      "\n",
      "From what I learned over the next few months was that the reason they rejected me was that I wasn't the guy that they had hand picked for her to date and subsequently marry. Needless to say they were extremely controlling and misogynistic, my GF told me more times than I can count that she felt like a slave in her parents house. \n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion that I have come to as to why they treated her the way they did was that she was a part of a broken adoption. Her parents had adopted her and her little brother when she was 10. The way they treat her, the things they have told her (they have never outright said that she was unwanted), how they act around her vs how they act around her siblings; everything they do makes me believe that they wanted to adopt her little brother not her. The orphanage she was placed in had a policy that if you wanted a kid and they had siblings, you had to take the siblings too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her parents and siblings went out of town to visit family for spring break, but  she had a job and couldn't go with them. We used this as an opportunity to take the next step in our relationship and sleep together (using 'slept together' as a euphemism cause I don't know if my post will be taken down if I say what we actually did). I know there are gonna be people out there who are gonna say that we shouldn't have done that because we are too young but it was what we felt was right to move our relationship forward, and because of it we were drawn even closer. I spent the entire week that her parents were away at her house and it was amazing to be able to hug and kiss her without having to worry about whether or not her parents would see. Because of events held by mutual friends and friends' parents, we had been able to hug and kiss each other but because of the places being events, her parents were always there and we had to walk on eggshells to avoid detection. After the week I spent at her place, she and I had never been closer, and would spend as much time on video calls as we could and would jump at any chance to meet up in person. \n",

This had been the ultimate commercial break, but now it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.\" At an event hosted by one of our close friends, I slipped up and her dad saw the two of us sitting next to each other with my arm draped around her shoulder. I saw him coming and was able to  act fast enough to play it off as if a leaf had landed on her shoulder and I was brushing it off, but it was too late and the damage had already been done. Her dad made her leave, and she told me that during the car ride home, he was interrogating her as to why my arm was around her. She was able to convince him that a leaf had in-fact landed on her shoulder and I was brushing it off, but her mom saw through it. Her mom dealt out severe punishments that forced my girl to confess what had been going on between me and her for the past few months. \n",

      "From what my girl told me, things got EXTREMELY heated. Her mom started shouting at her that I wasn’t a good person (they had never formally met me and I barely have any social media presence, and my gf and I were so diligent with how we got together that the only times other people found out that we were in a relationship was when we told them. Nonetheless, her parents knew jack squat about me), and my Gf started shouting back. I don’t know the exact specifics of what was said, but I know that her mom threw insults at her about how “stupid she must have been for dating someone like me” and pretty much any mistake she had made in the past seven years got thrown in her face. It got so bad that my Gf ran to her room IN TEARS because of how hurt she was by what her mom had said, which is saying something cause it takes A LOT to hurt my girls feelings.\n",

She cried and cried and cried, and I myself teared up cause the thought of having to live without her scared me more than anything has in my life. She eventually fell asleep in my arms, and I just held her the rest of the night, occasionally stroking her hair and kissing her forehead but mainly just trying to cope with the anxiety of possibly losing her and the looming feeling of dread that her parents' reaction gave me.\n",

Unfortunately, at the time we didn’t know this). \n",

I know she will try everything she can to be with me and I am doing everything I can to be with her and get her back, but I am unsure if things will work out. To me, the absolute worst possible outcome is she gives in to her parents and breaks up with me. She is my everything, but if breaking things off with me will make her happy, then I won’t fight it.

      "In January 2025 I caught Adam in a really big lie, which then brought out more lies, which completely broke my trust and my heart. At the time we had been going to pre marital counselling with my Mentor (31M) who was going to be the officiator at our wedding, who helped us talk it out. I forgave him and since then have been trying to mend my trust and our relationship. I regularly went through his phone and we had many discussions about what happened, recently I decided I need to let go of the reins a bit more to give him more space to gain my trust so I stopped going through is phone as frequently, etc. Almost 2 weeks ago we were on our way to work and my gut was telling my to look through his phone and I found exactly the same thing he did in January, and I asked him about it and he lied. He continued to lie to me all morning, texting me and begging me to believe him. He tried manipulation and gas lighting, I had to literally show him proof that I knew with no doubt he was lying to me for him to say “I have a problem, I’ll come clean when we get home” (as we were both at our jobs at the time). We got home and he comes clean about even MORE things he’s lied about, he was never really telling me the whole truth in January and yes, it’s the lies that have broke my trust but what really gets me is the gaslighting and manipulation and begging that is much harder for me to get over. Our relationship as of now is non existent, Ive postponed the wedding and now I need to decide what my next step is. \n",
      "My mentor thinks I should move out, give ourselves more space to grow individually and experience more of a traditional relationship. (By traditional I mean don’t move in together until we are married) we did move pretty fast and didn’t give ourselves time for that phase of going on dates and stuff, we just kinda jumped right into it and have been together basically everyday since we started dating. I do think because of everything that’s happened that we kind of need a refresh button, our relationship is basically non existent and I think the best option is to take a step back to give space for a step forward, you know? I don’t disagree that maybe I should move out. But there’s a few big factors that could make that not an option; \n",

      "\n",
      "3. He could go back to his parents house, and I stay on the lease, but his parents house is also full as he has quite a few siblings, and they also aren’t the best people for him to be around while he’s going through a massive change in his mentality. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. I have really bad anxiety, the apartment we live in is out of town from where we work and where our friends/family are, and if I were to stay and he go, my anxiety would probably spike from being far from everyone and I don’t think I’ll be able to handle that on top of everything else. \n",

      "Title: Different Approaches to Problems\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend (m, 43) and me (f, 38) have been arguing all the time lately. We've been together now just over three years. We've lived together for a year and a half. I feel like the predominant issue we have generally is that he is very laissez-faire about the way he lives his life and I'm not. Have you ever seen Summer Camp Island? Basically he's Oscar and I'm hedgehog. For instance, one of our cats got a totally swollen arm last week, and I wanted to take him to the vet after a few hours of the swelling, and he didn't. It turned out the arm got better the next day, thankfully. But that just irritates me because it almost validates him. Life has been overly stressful lately. Three of our cats since January have gotten diseases- cancer, FIP and an unknown eye issue (she still may lose the eye). These have been weighing heavily on me both emotionally and financially, on top of my own health issues. He never goes to the vet visits because they are my cats specifically, he doesn't handle the financial aspect of that either, for the same reason. But he acts like I'm the problem when I complain about the stress of these issues, or when I get stressed out about recent changes at our apartment complex. For instance, this argument started when he said \"try not to get into an argument with the new property manager.\" That comment made me so angry because it makes me feel like he sees me as some kind of instigator, merely because I wanted to email her to clarify points in the lease agreement that were written in very vague languate. It  all leaves me feeling like I can't even discuss basic life issues with him. I don't think it bodes well for our relationship that I am left carrying the work and weight of these issues alone. I get that since they are my problems because they are my cats having the issues and he doesn't need to take on 100% everything I take on, but it's almost like lately he's just worrying about his own hobbies like his painting or whatever only he needs to do and it just feels a lot like we're two separate people living our own lives yet living in the same house, which doesn't feel good to me. It doesn't feel like a team. I tried to discuss this with him tonight and it did not go well- he mostly made me furious by talking down to me/making me feel high strung just because I don't ignore things in life until they work themselves out like he does. He basically said \"my problem\" is I don't know how to be happy despite having problems, and he actually blamed his constant moodiness on me. I really don't think if we broke up he would magically be a happy person all the time. Like, he told me the reason he doesn't care to have a conversation about our future plans EVER even though my younger sister and her boyfriend are beginning steps to buy a home together, is becasue \"he just knows how to be happy and I don't.\" I just dont' know if this relationship issue is able to be worked through if we seem to be so different when it comes to this. \n",

      "Body text:  We dated in the past for three months in 2024, but she broke up with me and ghosted me. I dated someone else for six months a few months after that relationship ended, and during that time, my ex got jealous and begged me to come back to her, texting me constantly, bringing me gifts, etc. I felt really bad because I knew how badly I wanted her back too, but I was very weary of doing such a thing, especially given how the relationship ended last time. Plus, I was \"dating\" another girl for 6 months (she refused to put a label on it because she was not over her ex, which was a mistake even getting into that on my part) After my other relationship ended because she went back to her ex-boyfriend, my ex and I got back together. Things were great at first, we would go out, have fun, kiss al the time, have sex a lot, the whole 9 yards. but two months ago, during sex, she started crying and said it was extremely painful. She said it just hurt very bad, and she was not sure why. Since then, she's been distant, less affectionate, and seems unhappy.\n",

We talked, and she said she's depressed, (which she has always talked about since I have known her.) but I'm not seeing any changes; I know from experience that depression hits hard, but she is on a high dose of medicine, and I feel as though the way she has been treating me has not been a result from that. She's on Lexapro and birth control, which I know can affect hormones and mood. She's also been going out with her friends without inviting me, even though all their boyfriends are there. It makes me feel awful, because I want to be seen as her boyfriend, not someone she uses as emotional support when she is bored. She's canceled plans we've made, which has become an occurrence ever since the painful sex and emotional switch up, and it feels like I'm walking on eggshells around her. Overall, I have become quite unhappy, and even after we had a talk about this stuff, nothing has really changed. Overall, she has become very emotionally distant over time since that night. How can I fix this? I am at a loss, and I dont want to breakup with her because I love her very much, but at this point I am at a loss.

      "Body text: I (16F) have been with my boyfriend (15M) for about a year and a half. He is my first everything and I am for him too. As cliche as it sounds, we had a domestic violence seminar recently in school and it made me realize that my boyfriend would possibly qualify as a domestic abuser, but I’m worried I’m overreacting.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the entire relationship, I have felt like I put in more than I receive and like he doesn’t respect my feelings or values. He has always been the type of person to make these jokes kind of calling someone stupid. I’ll say things and he’ll just make these snide remarks in a snarky voice like “yeah everybody knows that” or “that’s not how that works blah blah blah” and I’ve told him so many times that I don’t like when he makes jokes like that at the expense of my intelligence. He also never listens to me when I say things I don’t want him to do. It’s small simple things like maybe he wants to buy me something or do something for me and I’ll repeatedly say no but he doesn’t listen. A few weeks ago I lost a pack of gum and he asked if I wanted him to buy me some. I said no but he continued saying “Are you sure?” “I’m gonna buy you some anyway” and I kind of snapped and said “No. Please listen when I say things the first time.” I usually feel very patient and calm and like I am being respectful, but I knew in that moment I wasn’t. Although it does sound false, I have been told by my psychiatrist that I exhibit many behaviors or BPD and I am worried that maybe the behaviors are getting worse because I have noticed that I’ve been getting angry and snapping at him a bit, but for the whole year and a half I’ve never felt like he truly listened to me and stopped doing things I didn’t like. He very often invalidates my feelings or tries to shift blame onto me if I bring up an issue. He never has mild reactions. He’s always either very angry or very guilty and upset, and either way I always end up apologizing for bringing up an issue that he may have caused. He’s also not the most stable either. He definitely struggles with childhood trauma and mental abuse, as well as adhd. But I just don’t know if this is something we can get through, I’ve told him many times that I don’t like these jokes, I don’t feel like he listens to me, and I feel like I put in way more than I receive. I understand that if I want more I should ask for it, I can’t expect him to read my mind, but he genuinely didn’t even get me a birthday gift. He bought me a wind chime(which I love and appreciate) on the way to my house as a last minute gift, while I pre-plan what I’m going to get him and start getting things or making things months in advance. I feel like seeing me out in the amount of effort I do should make it obvious he could put in at least a little more. Maybe just some flowers, or my favorite drink from a gas station, which he did do once so I can’t be mad, but just some basic effort besides just being there and maybe complimenting me. He does definitely treat me very well when he’s not upset, and he does more than what is the bare minimum, but I don’t want to tell him I don’t feel appreciated and have to be scared of how he’ll react. I talked to my therapist about him for the first time and I told her about how he was upset that I didn’t tell him I was walking home from school with my friend. He texted me before I even had the chance to tell him saying that he didn’t like having that sprung on him and how he always has to find out about things, but I feel like I always tell him what I’m doing when I go somewhere, and if I don’t beforehand I still tell him late, typically before he even asks. But he never does that. He has so many double standards in our relationship. But anyway, my therapist said that he sounded controlling, but if she only hears the bad and not the good then I’m worried things will get confused. I wish I had someone to see how he treats me all the time so I would know if I’m overreacting or not. \n",

      "He also does this thing where he’ll ask to hang out a day or so in advance and then the day of when I ask if he still wants to hang out he often says no because he’d rather be alone and he knows very well that almost nothing upsets me more and makes me more frustrated than plans getting changed like that, but he continues to do it so often. \n",

I just get so overwhelmed with emotions that I shut down and I can't find a way out of that hole to treat the situation with compassion and kindness. I get so overfilled with negative emotion that I doesn't feel like I have any kindness left in me. And I know that's not true, I know that's not the sort of person I am.

Recently I’ve come to the realization that she has an avoidant attachment style. Being vulnerable is really hard for her and I see it during conflict or even when everything is fine and I’m seeking some reassurance when I’m overthinking. She seems very hot or cold when it comes to affection. I crave affection often. I love this person so incredibly much but being with them has given me so much anxiety and fear. I always find myself questioning if they really love me or if they’re going to leave me because I’m “too needy”. I want this relationship to work and that’s why I’m seeking advice on how to fix or even just deal with this relationship. I feel as though my needs aren’t consistently being met and it’s pulling me apart.  How do I go about this relationship? Do I end it or is there something I can do. \n",

      "\n",
      "For a little back story, we were dance partners and would train together 2-3 times a week for almost a year. During that time, he started bringing me small gifts and I would ask him to walk me to my car after training for safety. That led to him fixing numerous small things on my car and even a couple significant fixes over time, all of which was his idea. On occasion he would give me larger gifts, and even a really thoughtful one on Valentine’s Day. We would regularly talk in the phone, normally for 1-3 hours but also small things here and there. He was always there for me in times of need. We would do random things outside of training. And then we would train things that required close proximity. We were basically committed to only training with each other, so we both put a lot of time and effort into that. I actually think I was his closest person, since he was literally always available for me and worked his plans around mine. Even on short notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of everything, he asked me on a road trip to something he knew I would enjoy, which didn’t end up happening because I cut things off. Now, if we were dance partners and none of the others things outside of training occurred, I wouldn’t have thought anything if it. But I started to get feelings for him. I would drop little hints or openings, like asking him if he gets all his friends thoughtful gifts in Valentine’s Day. He would flirt and I would flirt back, but we never kissed or anything like that. I did eventually address it, and told him how I was feeling and he said he didn’t feel the same way. I was crushed, but accepted it, and said we couldn’t be partners anymore. I didn’t explain it why but I knew I couldn’t handle it. He also never pushed.\n",

      "What I’m confused about is- why would someone put in that much effort into another person they don’t see romantically? Like, any of the things on their own would seem friendly but all of it combined seemed like too much effort for someone just trying to be friends. I’m also feeling hurt because, after all the time we spent together, he hasn’t said anything to me since. Didn’t even try to show care for us continuing to dance together. From what I can tell, he hasn’t been, and I have continued training with other people.\n",

      "Edit: I want to mention I had a good feeling I was going to be rejected. But ignoring my feelings for that long made them start to bubble up in unhealthy ways. I’m sad to lose a good friend in my life, and perhaps if I was a stronger person I could’ve handled the rejection and continued to work together. It really blows to not have a dance partner again. I just felt like I couldn’t really face him after that.\n",

      "Body text: I (30M) became really close with my best friend (23NB) towards the tail end of last year. Before then we were in each other's orbits and fairly close but since we started working together we became pretty inseperable. This surprised me to be honest. Obviously there's quite an age gap, but we work in hospitality where this isn't uncommon. You kind of make friends with everyone, we just happened to get really really close.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite intense to be honest. We had deep conversations, they would send me videos about how cool it was for them to finally have someone they could call their best friend (something we bonded over early, as we're both neurodivergent and struggle to connect with people). They sent me poetry they wrote about how much our friendship meant to them. They said they'd ask me to be their best man when they get married to their girlfriend, and I extended them the same offer. It felt so good to be able to just express how much they meant to me, and to have them respond in kind. It felt *nice* to finally have someone that cared so openly.\n",

      "In the last 2 months, something has shifted however, and it's making me think I'm going fucking crazy. They stopped sending me stupid little videos, saying that they were trying to focus on not doomscrolling as much. Ok, sure, that's reasonable. Then they asked me to stop asking them how their day was going, because it made them feel pressured to perform (whatever that means). But fine, I'm a good friend, I'll acquiesce and do whatever it takes to help them be comfortable. Now I'm lucky to hear from them at all. My Instagram used to get about 120 notifications a day, mostly from them. Now, I get 6. Every time I try to organize time to hang out, they are busy or have something else to do or are too fatigued. Today, we closed together, and they didn't say a single word to me aside from the odd comment about the close.

      "I'm a 22M and have been dating a 26F for nearly a month now. Things have been going really well, and I'm enjoying getting to know her. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a startup founder, and also we're both content creators, which is a nice common ground. So far, I've been paying for all our dates. She hasn't offered to split or pay yet, and honestly, I've generally just covered the bill, trying to be a gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past three years, I ran a service-based company that had great cash flow. This allowed me to build up a decent amount of savings, and I was pretty comfortable spending on things like nice dinners, dates, and experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this year I've made a big shift. I've decided to stop the service business and go all-in on building a product. This is a long-term project and a significant undertaking. It's currently costing me a substantial amount of cash and time each month (office, small product team, servers, infrastructure, etc.). Essentially, I'm burning through my savings to fund this dream, and I have a runway of a little less than a year to make it work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this financial reality, I feel it's no longer wise or sustainable for me to continue going on expensive dates or constantly eating out, as those costs add up quickly when you're bootstrapping a startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main concern is how to communicate this to her without her losing interest. I genuinely like her, and I want her to know this change isn't about her or my feelings for her. I suspect part of the initial appeal might have been my perceived success and my willingness to cover costs like a \"gentleman.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm taking a significant personal and financial risk to build this product, and I'd really appreciate a partner who understands that this is a temporary situation driven by ambition, and that it doesn't mean I care about her any less, and also doesn't mean that I can't earn more if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd love to suggest we shift towards more budget-friendly or even indoor dates for a while. We also live about an hour apart, which adds a bit of a travel hurdle (she currently pays for her own travel to see me). I have an EV so it's pretty inexpensive for me, and if she were to visit me more often, I'd be happy to contribute to her one-way travel costs to make things a bit easier, even if we're doing more low-key things at my place or around my area.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I bring this up? What's the best way to frame this conversation so she understands the situation, sees it as a temporary phase for a long-term goal, and hopefully supports this chapter of my life? I want to be transparent but also ensure she still feels valued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks in advance for any advice!\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: 22M founder recently pivoted from a cash-rich service business to a product startup, now burning savings with <1yr runway. Been paying for all dates (some expensive) with 26F he's been seeing for a month. Wants to tell her he needs to cut back significantly on date spending and suggest more indoor/budget-friendly dates due to startup costs, without her losing interest or feeling like he cares less. Looking for advice on how to communicate this effectively.\n",

      "Title: My bf said he doesn’t trust me\n",
      "Body text: My (25F) boyfriend (28M) and I have been together for about 5 months while doing 2ish months of long distance early on while I was away doing seasonal work. When we got together he knew I would be leaving to go work and I communicated to him that I am still young and want to be able to travel and take opportunities even if I’m in a serious relationship. He was fine with this at the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problems started while I was away, one of my male co workers kissed me on the cheek unprompted on my birthday and I was honestly shocked and weirded out and avoided him for the rest of my time there. I was working 12 hour days every day for 2 months so fucking exhausted and busy and didn’t tell my bf about the kiss until a week or two later when it came up. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was immediately super upset and suspicious of me especially because I had my birthday while I was gone and these dumb boys were flirting with me at the bar (which I told him about) and I brushed them off. So with the boys flirting with me and this invasive kiss he was left feeling jealous and untrusting. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I got back home we were able to work things out and I thought things were going super well. I had planned a trip for a month in June to travel with friends. And I had communicated to him that if he is jealous and can’t handle the distance then we should end it but he was adamant that he got over it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Until I left for my trip yesterday and in the morning I wake up and find out he’s gone through my phone because he thinks I was on dating apps while I was away. He felt horrible and confessed to it immediately but because of what he found had decided that he doesn’t trust me anymore. I had texted one of my friends on my bday that I had liked one of the guys that was flirting with me at the bar on hinge months prior when I was still single. He didn’t read the texts long enough to read the part where I say I swerved him at the bar and it’s so nice having a bf and not caring about boys. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was so angry that he had gone through my phone and I feel like my trust in him is broken. But I’m also devastated cause other than the jealousy issues i’ve felt like our relationship is perfect. He makes me so happy and I genuinely saw a future with him which I hadn’t experienced in this way before. Until the phone thing I was feeling so happy and in love. And now I’m so hurt that he doesn’t trust me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to spend my life trying to convince someone I’m not lying and cheating on them. That hurts the most, that this person I love and thought I trusted doesn’t believe me or my character to trust I wouldn’t do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "We talked about it for a long time before I left for the airport and he acknowledges that it comes from his own insecurity and depression. He even scheduled an appt to get back in therapy or on meds. \n",
      "\n",
      "But ultimately I don’t know what to do. Is it worth it to try and make it work when it’s felt really good except for 3 incidents of jealousy. Or to just let things go because those tough moments have made me feel so sad and hurt inside. I genuinely believe he’s a good person and this conflict is a manifestation of his depression. But can I / should I have to get over it? Or should I just move on? \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR \n",
      "My bf confessed to going through my phone and not trusting me. I am devastated but he said he would go to therapy and work on things. I don’t know if I should keep trying or move on. \n",

      "Body text: Tldr My BF and I argued twice in one day over tone—once I thought he sounded annoyed, and later I felt he sounded mean. He says I come off passive-aggressive. How can we improve communication?\n",
      "\n",
      "My bf [26M] and I [25F] have a really great relationship for the most part. Except yesterday we got into an argument over 2 incidents that happened within a few hours of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "1)I was doing the laundry and putting liquid laundry detergent into the laundry machine. I use a small cup to pour detergent from the big bottle and into the wash load. Afterwards, I hastily rinsed the cup with water but there were still soap suds on it. My bf asked me if I cleaned and I said yes I did. He then came over and saw the cup with soap suds, and he said \"No you didn't, there are still soap suds on it\" as he rinsed it off again more vigorously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I interpreted his tone as him being annoyed and so I got kind of serious and quiet (but he later told me that he wasn't annoyed). I said \"Oh ok\" and nothing else. Shortly after, he told me that he didn't like that I became so serious, and he preferred if I kept it lighthearted and said, \"Oh sorry, I didn't mean to.\" I explained to him that I thought he was annoyed, and my response when people get annoyed is to give them a few minutes alone to cool down before talking to them. I then told him, \"Sorry I'll try to speak differently next time\" and we resolved it. He then told me that I was still talking seriously [idk another way to describe it, maybe grumpy) and he said that whenever he points something out to me, I don't take it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it's helpful info, I live in his apt and all the laundry equipment is his.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)A few hours later, I took my sheets and blankets out of the dryer. They were still a little damp, but I took them out because I was fine with them air-drying for the next hour before my bf and I went to sleep. I left my bf's blankets and sheets to continue drying so that they would be completely dry before we went to sleep (we sleep on separate beds and put all our sheets in the same dryer load). I brought my blankets back to the room and my BF asked why I took mine out early. I said that they were dry, but he didn't believe me so he felt them and they were a little damp. He told me to put them back in the dryer, and I said no. He told me again, and I said that I was fine with them air drying because they were mostly dry. He told me again to put them back, but this time in a tone that I interpreted as a little mean. I said in response, \"Sheesh. You could have told me a little differently\" and then we got into an argument about tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that he was only speaking emphatically because it was his 3rd time telling me to put the stuff back in the dryer. He also explained that he just wanted me to have dry sheets to sleep on. He said that I came off as passive aggressive in my \"sheesh\" reply, but I was just trying to let him know how I felt in a kinda lighthearted way.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are small things but it's not the first time we've had arguments about especially my tone and how I don't understand how I come off to others. He says that I objectively have a hard time understanding and communicating gone- I mean, sometimes I think I do but idk if it's really all me all the time.\n",

      "Body text: Me (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for almost a year and a half. We started dating in my senior year in high school and my boyfriend’s junior year. I am currently a freshman in college and he is a senior in high school. He has been loving to me but I can never forget when we faced a huge issue 3 almost 4 months into our relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "3-4 months into our relationship was in May last year when we were in high school together. We were both friends with this girl (9th grade). I (12th grade) found out that the girl (9th grade) was going through some mental issues with depression and was seeking help. She used to do self h*rm the year before and just as she thought she was getting better, she was struggling with depression again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She talked to my boyfriend (11th grade) because she needed mental help and my boyfriend was the best person to talk to about this because he had good advice for her. She doesn’t know this but he used to go through the same issues as her in his freshman year for a short period of time when he went through a rough time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was helping her with her issues, they would talk from evening to night through texts. I trusted both of them because I know that the girl will never betray my trust for one because she respected and admired me as a leader of many things that she is part of and my boyfriend apparently isn’t attractive to most girls. The issue I had with this was that I would be on call with my boyfriend while he would be texting her about the issues which I thought was a good thing because I wanted her to be okay because she was my friend and the situation was dire since this wasn’t the first time she went through this. I felt really lonely as it went on for days with him being on the phone and just not saying anything for hours but just texting. Sometimes he would update me on what she said and is going through when it’s serious or when I ask him how she’s doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend is very honest with me so he would tell me honestly and he would send me screenshots of the texts and would also let me look at them on his phone myself. I trusted him so much that I just didn’t care that I was feeling lonely and I almost felt jealous because my friend is still a girl, but I later found that I wasn’t in the wrong for feeling that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend never hides anything from me and is very honest. He ended up telling me that he was feeling confused and thought he liked my friend and my trust completely shattered. He said “I love you, but I like ****”. I completely lost it and nearly broke up with him right there but I still loved him so I just said we need a break. I didn’t speak to him or meet him because it was the weekend but 8 hours later, he texted me saying that he was an idiot for even thinking that he liked her and realized he just did not have feelings like that anymore. His reasoning was that he would never like someone who is just like himself because he hates himself. I wanted to trust him and I ended up continuing our relationship like before but the pain still remained even up until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, I am a freshman in college and a person who I never knew would text me for any reason suddenly reached out. It was an ex-FWB I had in my sophomore year. We never talked for a long time because I thought he was using me and cheating on his partner while being with me. I talked to his partner and it turned out that they were aware of what we had and was ok with it but I decided to never speak to him ever again after confirming that his partner knew and was ok with it. I’m confused with their relationship too but it’s complicated. I’m assuming they are ok with having FWBs while dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to check up on me because we had a dear friend who passed away suddenly (reasoning I will keep confidential). He wanted to make sure I was ok mentally after the shock from the sudden news. He apologized for hurting me and for everything he has done in our old relationship. I am a Christian and I believe that enemies should be forgiven so I forgave him and welcomed him back because we used to be good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my boyfriend that my ex-FWB reached out and about how I forgave him and he started flipping out. He was panicking and telling me I have to cut ties with him immediately and he made multiple excuses why he didn’t support my decision. First it was “I don’t want you to be with someone who hurt you” then it was “I hate this guy” then it was “he’s manipulating you using our deceased friend as an excuse” then it became “he is disrespecting our deceased friend”. I was overwhelmed with his sudden outburst that I got angry because in my mind, I just wanted to forgive an enemy and move on with life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I completely missed the fact that even though we didn’t talk for a whole year, our past is still there and we are still ex-FWBs. I understood my boyfriend’s argument there but what I didn’t understand was why he had to use our deceased friend as an excuse. At that point, the manipulating person wasn’t my ex-FWB but my own boyfriend. He barely knows my ex-FWB but still went on about how I should never forgive him. I thought he would understand that I want to just be a good person and go to heaven one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also quit sexual activities as well and promised to never do such things again until marriage. Also me and my ex-FWB never had s*xual intercourse but we called and the only time we were together in my sophomore year was one occasion and we cuddled. We paused all these activities until the summer before senior year and we called again. Then we stopped again for good when I finally had the courage to ask him if his partner was even ok with this. I only knew that my ex-FWB was polyamorous so I was just assuming it was ok to do this the whole time until I got confirmation from him that it wasn’t and I had to tell his partner everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend begged me over and over to cut ties with my ex-FWB and I understood why, but I felt really sad about letting an old friend go. For the sake of my boyfriend’s feelings I did as he told me, with his help of calling my ex-FWB and talking to him because I was afraid to do it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then my trust was broken again. I felt uncomfortable that my boyfriend was still talking to the girl that he used to like and I asked him to cut ties with her as well. He refused over and over saying that he can’t just do it because he sees her everywhere. He made many excuses that supported why he only can’t cut ties with her but shouldn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt so angry. I only wanted to forgive someone and move on but I felt that he was the manipulative person again and not my ex-FWB. He convinced me to cut ties but he wouldn’t do it himself when I ask him. He liked her and I never liked and never will like my ex-FWB that way. How could he ever think that staying with the girl who made me lost my trust in him would make me ok. I hate him so much because I lost the chance for me to finally let go of my burdens of someone who hurt me before and I’ve been hurt by the person who was supposed to support and love me. Again I understand why he thought I shouldn’t be friends with my ex-FWB but then I could have just asked him to be acquaintances and nothing more. The thing that makes me angry is the fact that he shouldn’t have asked me to cut ties like that when he can’t even do it in the first place with the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now whenever I see him, I can’t trust him. I can’t love him like I used to. I hate touching him in any way. His touch feels uncomfortable. It’s almost like I just don’t love him at all because now he is untrustworthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know what to do and I want to forgive him but it’s so difficult to do so even though forgiveness is what I do. Or at least did until he ruined me.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My trust was broken when my boyfriend ended up liking my friend while dating. My ex-FWB who was a good friend reached out to check if I was ok after a friend’s passing. My boyfriend made many reasons for me to cut ties with him and said my ex-FWB was manipulating me and I did because I understood that we still had a past. I asked my boyfriend to cut ties with my friend because he used to like her and he made excuses not to which broke my trust again because he at that point was manipulating.\n",

So we talked a bit and set up a first date. It was smooth, easy to talk to her and just had great time. We set up a few more dates and now going on a month things were going well.

I said hey, just send me a text if you are busy or need space or are busy just is nicer then silence. So we hung out on Sat, Sun we talked and were going to meet up on Monday. So Monday comes she woke up feeling kinda off cause she didn't sleep well and asked for a rain check. But in there I was texting a friend about some lawyer stuff and I by mistake copied the text from my friend to send to her as texts were coming in quickly.  \n",

      "Body text: my \"gf\" 26F; not sure if it's because I'm yet to officially ask her out, although we've mutually agreed exclusivity but she still insists I must ask her out officially. We are \"dating\" with marriage in view. She gets so stressed out whenever I bring up issues to work on to improve our relationship. I don't bring up such issues in an accusatory or antagonizing manner, always sweetly, but she somehow manages to guilt-trip me by gaslighting, but deep down I can just feel her stressed over discussing such issues, I love her but regardless, I believe such issues need to be said out at least, & I've told her. I have given her the option of us stop talking or keep dating & she always chooses us to keep dating. I'm scared for the long run, although, like I said I'm not sure if this attitude is because I'm yet to ask her to be my gf officially. She also warned me she tends to get very attached which is not a problem for me, I actually like to handle that on the contrary, but I'm yet to see the attachment from her ends yet as she is quite unaffectionate, never shows that she loves me through actions which makes me overthink often. Whenever I bring up her lack of reciprocity up she somehow deflects it or turns it around on me. Idk, I love her & want us to work out. She travelled to see her mom for two weeks, so I'm giving her some space, & plan on asking her out officially when she gets back & see if things change. My love languages are mostly words of affirmation (i don't mind affirmation via actions, she does neither), physical touch, quality time (both typically not sexual in context, but could be lol), her's are receiving gifts & acts of service which i find as a red flag in the first place but it's okay since it's what she likes & I love her anyway. I've read articles on conflict-avoidant partners & mostly they never change (especially when they don't acknowledge it as a problem that needs to be worked on in the first place). I bring up issues in a gentle way, I also encourage & ask her to tell me ways I can improve or things I do that she dislikes but she almost always never does & Idk if it's because she actually has nothing she dislikes about me cos I actually try to always make her happy, even compromising on some things. I like her & want it to work. This is my first real/serious relationship, & so far I've learnt patience by force. I respect people in longer relationships. P.s we've been talking/dating for like two/three months now. I've never been so mentally unstable; always overthinking & doubting cos she never communicates well. Yet to kiss her too, as she won't allow until I officially ask her out. But I'm being patient with that cos I don't want to commit into something that won't work. Today she confirmed that we are exclusive, so maybe I can allow a trial & error basis & ask her out officially, & see how it goes. I need help fr, it's driving me crazy how someone wouldn't want to address obvious issues in a relationship & lack of reciprocity & affection, including lack of affirmation of love; but whenever I ask bluntly she says she likes me.\n",
      "\n",
      "tl;dr! when we first started talking didn't think it was gunna work out cos she said she doesn't want to have kids as her deal-breaker, & had turned down many guys cos of that, but just when I made it clear that I want kids & wouldn't fold, & was going to walk away, she painfully said that she would compromise. I saw the pain in her face when she said it & assured her that I would always be by her side forever. Now in retrospect idk if that was just a manipulation tactic or she really didn't want kids. Idk, women are so funny. She's slowly losing me atp with her lack of affection & reciprocity the most.\n",

      "Body text: my (20f) girlfriend (21f) and i have been together for a while now and friends for even longer. we have been clear about being committed to eachother and our intentions to move in together when i finish college. i graduate at the end of the year and will be going straight into a job in my field of study. we both live at home with our own families and want to move together after im out of school so we can be closer (we live about 4 hours apart currently) shes told me before that her goal is to someday live in seattle, and i support that. however i am not the kind of person to pack up my life and have my first apartment be across the country. she recently took a trip to seattle and it definitely solidified her desire to move there. she offhandedly mentioned that the next time she moves will be there; this took me by surprise but i didn’t engage in a conversation about it because it was not an appropriate time to have an emotional conversation + she is known for being indecisive and changing a lot. today we were in the car with a mutual friend (let’s call them A) and A’s mom. while talking about all of our mutual friends and our plans post college grad; A told her mom excitedly that my girlfriend will be moving to seattle this year. i immediately started panicking and asked her when she was doing that. she said by the end of the year. am i crazy or is it kind of fucking insane that this is how i am finding this out. not the first time she has done something like this and i’m getting really agitated. less than a month ago we seemed to be on the same page and now it looks like i dont fit in her plan anymore; but fuck if she tells me that herself. \n",

      "Body text: A few months ago, I (21M) started getting close to a girl (let’s call her Emily, 19F) after going through a really rough time—losing both my long-term girlfriend and my best friend. Emily and I talked every day, spent a lot of time together, and basically acted like we were in a relationship, even though we agreed we weren’t exclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now. I found out that a guy from our friend group (we’ll call him Alex, 20M) slept with my ex months ago. Me and him weren’t close when it happened, but we became friends after. The worst part is he never told me, and I found out from other people. That’s really the only issue I had with him—just that he never came clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first found out, I asked Emily if she wanted to hang out. I told her I felt like I had no one to trust anymore. She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about, told me I could trust her, and let me open up to her emotionally. I cried in front of her and let myself be vulnerable, thinking she was really there for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But behind my back, she was texting Alex about me being angry, even though I literally begged her not to say anything to him until I confronted him myself. She looked me in the eye and lied straight to my face while playing both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on, she told me Alex had been threatening her—saying he would expose her secrets if she didn’t do what he said. She claimed he made her agree to manipulate me and make everything feel like it was my fault. At first I believed her. But when I asked her to show me the texts, I saw how she actually responded to him: saying stuff like “I’ll do it, don’t worry” and “don’t worry king, I’ll do it.” It didn’t feel like someone being threatened. It felt like someone agreeing to play along.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was crushed. I kicked her out of my car after seeing those texts. That night, I called her sobbing. I couldn’t even speak at first—I just kept asking how she could do this to me. She had nothing to say except “I’m sorry” over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, Alex texted me trying to act like he was being mature, saying the situation “got out of hand,” and that what I saw was an “over-exaggeration.” He admitted there were problems but said they “can’t be fixed” and that he feels bad, but we should just move on. Not once did he actually take responsibility for lying to me or for what he told Emily to do. He tried to spin the whole thing to make it seem like I’m the one overreacting. It felt like a complete deflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, I’ve been stuck between numbness and breaking down. I don’t understand how either of them could do this to me. I trusted them. They were two people who were there for me when I was at my lowest. And they turned around and did this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that messes me up the most is, part of me still wants Emily to care. I want her to feel the weight of what she did every single day. I know that’s unhealthy, but I can’t help it. She’s apologized through texts, but it doesn’t feel like enough. She never once came clean until I forced it out.\n",

      "Body text: Let me start by saying my GF is an absolutely incredible woman in so many ways and I love her very much.  She is incredibly intelligent, highly educated, very ambitious, has a ton of grit but she's also still very feminine, very attractive and we have a ton of chemistry most of the time (same sense of humor, same values for the most part etc..) She gets along great with my family, my friends and we are nearly a perfect match in so many ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one issue that is really eating away at me though.  I have this feeling that sometimes nothing is \"enough\" for her and she's \"on my case\" much more often than I would like.  I try to be the best boyfriend I can be and often times, I feel like I do more than most guys are probably doing, although this could be in my head.  I am essentially self employed in the real estate investment/brokerage world so I make an incredible income ($500-750k/yr) for my age and have access to very lucrative investment opportunities as well.  I view this as a golden opportunity to set us up for life and make sure we never have to worry about money when we have a family and give us a level of freedom most people can only dream of. However, that comes at a cost as I have to work a lot and sometimes things change quickly, I lose track of time, I get stressed about work and bring it home with me etc.. With that being said, I still dedicate a lot of time to our relationship and work around 50 hours per week.  Most evenings I set my phone down and try to be very present with her, I try to help her out around the house when she needs it, we take our dog on walks, I spend time/energy participating in hobbies/activities that she really wants to do, but I would probably never do on my own (gardening for example).  I also don't work on the weekend anymore so we can spend time together. Not complaining about this at all, just an observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just moved in together a few months ago and had this agreement that I would pay the majority of rent at our house and she would take care of most things around the house.  For the most part, this has been the case however she does often ask for my help on things, but it's usually small things that pale in comparison to what she's doing around the house.  She has incredibly high standards for basically everything and if something isn't done perfectly she gets really upset.  This has lead to a lot of fights and is our biggest issue.  Its tough because I genuinely feel like I'm trying, and I'm spending far more time on \"house\" related activities than I ever have in my life, but it still seems to fall short of her expectations more often than not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recent example was this week.  We got a ton of her things out of storage and moved them all into our house and it's a LOT of stuff.  It's been a massive project getting the house setup, getting things organized in a meaningful way etc.. She works from home and I go into an office, so the past 2 weeks or so she has been working on the house a lot while I'm away at work. I come home and help out in the evenings and will help out on the weekends, but she's def doing a lot more than me.  These are all her belongings and she wants the house to be setup a very specific way, so it can be difficult for me to help if she's not there because if I don't do it exactly the way she wants, it's counterproductive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 nights ago she told me she's been very overwhelmed with the house stuff and she feels a bit of resentment that I get to go to work and leave it all for an entire day while she's stuck with it.  She said she needs more help.  I told her I would work from home yesterday and wake up early to help before work, and then find times throughout the day to help.  I woke up at 5am with her, got some things done around the house and then started my work day.  I had 3 periods where I didn't have to do anything for 45min-1 hour and went up to her home office to ask what she wanted help with.  She was really busy with work and didn't have the time to think of anything really big I could do without her, so she gave me a handful of smaller tasks such as dishes, trash, etc.. I did all of them, however when I did the dishes I was on a work call and carelessly left a few lids in the sink.  I also left my morning coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I was on a work call so wasn't giving the dishes my full attention but got 90% of them done (along with everything else she asked me to do) and then walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple of hours later, she got very upset with me about the dishes.  She said you told me you'd help me today, you barely helped at all and you couldn't even finish the dishes right because you were on a work call.  She told me she often feels like my job is my number 1 priority and she feels like she's in 2nd position.  I felt pretty hurt as I had woken up so early to get things done, I had agreed to work from home and I had done everything she asked me to do and had set time periods aside to help her and here I was getting yelled at for leaving a few lids in the sink and my coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I told her I came up to her office several times throughout the day to ask what she needed help with and it's not my fault she didn't have anything meaningful for me to work on.  She felt that I was doing the dishes when I was on a work call and didn't finish them to completion, and this made her feel like my job was more important than helping her around the house after I promised that the house would be a priority today.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got in a big argument and I definitely pushed back.  To me this feels a bit crazy because I followed through on everything we talked about except the 3 lids in the sink and the coffee mug but her immediate reaction was to look at what I didn't do right instead of what I did do right.  To her, this felt like she really didn't give me a ton of stuff to do and the few things she did ask me to do, I couldn't do right because I was more focused on work.  She felt that I made a promise I would prioritize the house and then I was carelessly working on the small tasks she gave me while on a work call.  Something of this same nature has been a recurring theme in our relationship.  It will often surprise me as well,  I'll come home and do things with her for 3 hours and then she'll still get upset about something or make comments insinuating that she's just doing everything in this relationship. Some days things are incredible, other days it feels like no matter what I do, she will get upset with me for something that feels small or insignificant to me. She told me the biggest thing that bothers her is when I say I will do something and then I either don't or do it in a half-ass way because my job  gets in the way.  However I feel if I'm honest with her and just straight up say \"I don't have time to help with that today because I have to work\" then she will also get upset.  I spend many multiples more time working on house related activities than I did when I was single and it still seems to fall short of her expectations often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to reiterate I really do love this girl and want to marry her, but this feeling I have inside is hard to ignore.  This is our only real issue and everything else is nearly perfect.  This is not my first serious GF, but this is my first time living with a girl so I'm wondering if this is a normal thing when moving in with someone or if we're actually more incompatible than we thought (or I'm just being an asshole).  If we're looking at this relationship logically from a \"value-add\" standpoint, my biggest value-add is my income/investments and financial strength.  Her's is handling our personal lives and the house (cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dog, keeping our lives interesting with fun trips etc..).  I feel an immediate benefit from her \"value-add\" as I come home to a beautiful, clean home every day with a delicious meal cooking.  She feels an immediate benefit on the financial side to some extent because I pay for significantly more than she does, however I feel the benefit I am providing is more of a long term benefit, not something you feel right here right now.  I'm wondering if that's contributing to this.  Curious what the Reddit community thinks about this whole thing and what the best next steps are.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - I feel like I'm spending way more time on \"house\" related chores/activities than I ever have before, but it seems to consistently fall short of my girlfriends expectations.   She often feels like she's 2nd priority behind my job, simultaneously I feel like I'm working less than I ever have to make sure I have time to help her and spend time with her.\n",

      "\n",
      "it's sort of frustrating that i was offered this trip and asked when would work, but at the same time.. it's a free trip to disneyland. i started to try and just think of positives: ok, not on the actual birthday.. i can still make something happen and make it special. i can also just ask how my partner feels about me going on a trip so close because i value his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "so.. i called him up. i had already prefaced to him a couple weeks ago that this trip was happening. i told him that i found out the trip was happening a day after his birthday and wanted to make sure he was okay with it. on the phone, he seemed really hurt by it. i went on a trip a week before his birthday last year with his family, and he brought up how he had wished it didn't happen two years in a row. i asked him if he wanted me to not go and he responded with \"i would never tell you to not do that\". i told him that i have been planning to make the day of his birthday special no matter what. after i said that, he wanted some space since he was feeling upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "for the record him being hurt is TOTALLY valid in my eyes. me and my partner have been wanting to go to disneyland together for so long but money has made that difficult for us to plan, so the trip happening for me for free without him.. let alone near his birthday, it just really sucks. i already was trying to think of special plans for his birthday day, which i would be 100% avaliable for, but he says the excitement of me going to the parks is probably just going to dull whatever comes before the trip. im at a total loss of what to do. this trip ironically is coming at a good time after a recent failed reconnection with my birth mother, and i could really use fun chosen family time right now.. but i don't know if going is just going to induce bitterness/sadness for my partner in the long run. i guess my question is, IS there a right thing to do in this situation? either way i feel like im going to feel bad. im open to any advice or insight.\n",

      "Body text: So I don’t know if I’m over exaggerating, but this whole situation makes me literally feel like I need to throw up. Basically last year I had my internship at this reptileshop for 8 weeks and that is where I met my ex. We would get along really well and had a lot of joking and teasing around with each other. Even though he was way older than me (at the time 18 and he was 31) I still began catching feelings for him. I’ll spare you all the details on how it all happened but basically he started catching feelings for me too and one day he asked me to have a drink with him at a bar, so I did and we got a bit tipsy, wich made us both brave enough to confess our feelings towards each other. So we kissed and had sex that night and eventually after some days went by, we were officially in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met his family and his kids (yes he had two daughters) and everything went well. But he changed his whole personality when we were official. He was manipulative and stuff (too complicated and long of a story to type right now) but there was one thing he did that still makes me feel sick. He would have morning sex with me after I repeatedly said no because I was still tired and wanted to sleep longer or just because I don’t like morning sex. Two times I even cried during the morning sex after I said no multiple times and he was too horny to notice. My friends, who I at the moment of the relationship still lived with, all know about this, cuz I told them everything after we broke up. They also know that I was really not okay during the relationship, because I didn’t get out of bed, I didn’t go to school, I barely ate and had no energy to the point I couldn’t even stand for longer than a minute. We only dated for like a month after three months of getting to know each other. I broke up with him after a fight and he didn’t took the break up well, he send me long and weird manipulative paragraphs that I also showed to my friends.\n",

My friend even told me how enthusiastic she was and how her boyfriend (the other friend) has already talked a lot with my ex. The thing is they should be able to have their internship wherever they want and I totally get that they chose this one, cus it’s the nearest reptile shop from their house and they both love reptiles, but I just can’t handle the fact that they will be around my ex everyday for 8 weeks and not knowing what they’re talking about. I’m scared they might like him and become friends with him, cuz he’s very likable at first. I’m also scared that he will lie about things that happened and that they’ll believe him. I just don’t know what to do, cuz I feel betrayed by my friends but at the same time it seems unfair that I feel this way cuz they mean no harm. Am I being dramatic?\n",

      "So, my bf and were friends in 7th grade and only starting becoming best friends in high school. His father had just died, I was living in an abusive home, and we became really great shoulders to lean on. We came to the conclusion that we absolutely loved each other and wanted to be together forever no matter what. We want to get married, have kids, grow old together. He has been my rock through thick and thin, he taught me that it's okay to cry, he showed me how beautiful life can be, he kept me on this Earth just by being himself, and I've apparently done the same for him.\n",

      "That being said, there are some bumps in our love story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within these past 2 years, he's been growing really anxious about loosing all this 'time' to do things he wants to do, like work on little hobbies and projects he makes for himself. He works 4 days a week, 12am-7, and had 3 days off in a row. He has plenty of time, but he still makes it as an excuse to stay up super late, to not do other household responsibilities, to not take a shower and take care of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll be talking and he will bring up all the things that are stressing him out, they are things that aren't happening yet; paying bills and stuff (he doesn't pay rent, doesn't pay car bills or car insurance, doesn't even pay his phone bill). He says one thing that stresses him out is proposing to me and it's on his to-do list. That kinda hurts me, but I understand where he's coming from. It is a big decision, but it's one I thought we already agreed upon many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am worried that when we do get married (if we ever do), that he'll be miserable, that when we have kids, he will be unhappy. I just want him to be happy. I've asked him many times if he would want a break, if he is sure he wants to be marry me... he always says he does but that he's just scared. Idk what that means or what I can do about that other than wait longer for him to get his shit together.\n",

She met this boy, and shared he’s from a giant family and the parents are abusive and controlling and his mom kicked him out to sleep outside multiple times a week and he’s frequently in tears. He supposedly is enrolled at a tech college, and is employed at a minimum wage job. \n",
      "\n",
      "About one week after dating, he chose to leave home and be homeless. He was sleeping outside in a ghetto, unsafe part of town, so through my daughter, I gave him a list of resources for homelessness. I have given him two bikes but they keep getting stolen. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the start, I told my daughter he might be the soulmate for her she thinks he is, but I cannot allow her to be with a boy whose circumstances will drag her down. He needs to stay in school, keep his job, work toward transportation, and find safe housing of some sort. I said she can wait for him to get there, but I need to limit their time together until he’s ready to be in a relationship. My expectation of her is to stay employed, focus on starting college, and handle her own responsibilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "So now we get to my concerns. They are SO invested in each other but he doesn’t seem to be making good choices or have any drive at all. He seems to be perfectly fine with surviving versus living. He got a second job but I just heard he’s at risk of losing his first one because he’s too exhausted from biking all the time. He hasn’t gone to any of the places I recommended that can give him food, clothes, help with the bus system, register him as homeless so he can get free tuition and put financial aid towards his needs, etc. \n",

      "I get that he needs help, but my daughter is newly an adult about to start college and her focus should be on good grades, making friends, staying employed, diving into a hobby, and not finagling ways to see this boy every spare second and have to leave work crying because he texted that he got hit by a car on his bike but he’s ok, and then ask to see her therapist because she’s so worried about him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know where to draw the line. I don’t want to forbid them talking because that won’t work, but the more I let them talk and see one another the more in love they fall!

      "Body text: I'm not sure where to post this so I thought here might be a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "I(28f) and my husband (31m) had twins over a year ago, but I can't get over the resentment I have for my husband. For some context we live in a small 2 bedroom house, and already have an older son(stepson). We got together when his son was 2 and they were operated over a year. We didn't get married until about 5 years later(COVID delayed), and got pregnant a year after marriage. This was a planned pregnancy though still a surprise when we found out it was twins. We had planned to share our room with the baby for the first 2 years. While we looked for a bigger home, but with two babies those plans became a bit harder. I had an extremely easy pregnancy and yet it makes me sad even thinking about it. I would love to feel pregnant again, but would never want to be with my husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through out my pregnancy I carried extremely well, and even looked most of the time like I was only carrying one baby. The first trimester I was extremely tired and could hardly eat while also feeling like I was starving. Thankfully my husband never complained about the house becoming messy and dinner not made with me having no energy. I did always made sure our son was fed, but those were usually quick meals when I couldn't be up for long. 2nd trimester came and I hadn't really gained any weight. I barely saw my actual OB and a lot of step in doctor's didn't even read my chart to see that I was carrying twins! Which surprise you need a specialized doctor for twin pregnancies. You can't just see a normal delivery doctor. The twins were gaining really well, and I could finally eat a bit more. Sadly though since both placentas were at the front I could hardly ever feel the babies move. This made me feel like I wasn't really pregnant at times because nothing was happening.I got more energy, and worked until a week before birth. Which was sadly a C-Section because I got very early signs of Preeclampsia at 36weeks. I did thankfully change my OB a little over half way through my pregnancy though. Which lifted some stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the part that I'm upset about is the entire time I was pregnant I felt like a single mom. I was taking care of my eldest like I usually do, but at that time he was going through a lot to where he was hospitalized and put into therapy. I ran around trying to take care of everything he needed which was fine, but it add to my feelings of feeling alone? My husband leaves most days before we even get up(630am), and doesn't get home until 8pm. He has his own construction business, and makes decent money working alone. He works about 6 days a week, and barely spent time with the family on Sundays. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now comes what really upset me. While I was pregnant he refused to touch my belly. He thought it was creepy when I'd asked him too, and that by me asking made him feel I was forcing him into doing something he didn't want to do. Side note I had and still have no stretch marks. My belly was beautiful, but he made me feel gross. This didn't stop him from wanting sex though that wasn't a problem, and when I wasnt in the mood he'd make he feel bad for not wanting to even give him a blowjob let alone a hand job. He never wanted to talk to them, and again if I asked I was forcing him. He didn't even want to feel when they randomly moved. It was my first pregnancy and I felt like I was living with a roommate and had a son who hated me for becoming pregnant. The first time the moved I was so excited and I barely got him to feel. He was so unexcited and just said \"yea....they do that\" and walked away. I barely had any photos of myself while pregnan, because I felt that selfies were very cringey. I even asked my husband could take photos of me one day, and even asked in advance (days before) to make sure I didn't get all dressed up for nothing. He got mad at me still because he was busy with paperwork and when he finally wanted to take the photos it was dark outside. Mind you I was pregnant in the summer time and it didn't get dark till like 9-10pm. I also had gotten into PJs by then! He said he'd take photos another day, but that day never came. I didn't dare ask or remind him, because I didn't want to be let down again. I knew I was upset by this and it's just been clinging to me and won't go away. I didn't realize how much this hurt until I broke down bawling my eyes out over a reddit story about a husband who's wife wouldn't let him touch or even talk to her pregnant belly. To hear how much he loved her and she pushed him away broke me. It made me feel like my husband truly only married me to take care of his son, that I was just a fuck nanny he tied down by getting her pregnant so she wouldnt leave him. I've talked to him about how I feel and he's tried to be more present. Even after birthday he barely held and took care of the twins. Which made me question more if he even wanted them! Thankfully my mom was here to help and he didn't complain, but it didn't mean I didn't pass out from sleep depravation while breastfeeding, pumping, folding clothes, or sitting and rocking a twin to sleep. They didn't stop needing to be fed every 2 hours until almost 3 months old. \n",

I married a man who I thought was an amazingly caring father who loves his eldest, but now I don't even know why I'm married to a man who for a while felt like he tolerated having more kids.

If we were only the 2 of us it was normal.\n",

Weirdly enough she told me that I needed to ask Dalu if that's okay for her because maybe she doesn't want any more guests. I asked Dalu if I could go with my fiance and she said no...which was weird for me but I thought, Jess was pretty happy with that response like \"I told you\". I've been dating my fiance for 6 years, we live together so they know it's an important part of my life.\n",
      "I thought it doesn't matter, we can still go together and you can just wait for me outside...Idk it was weird he wasn't allowed to go. Her wedding was pretty small, like 20 ppl small so I tried to be understanding, she invited only her closest.\n",
      "I asked Jess if it was fine for her or not if my fiance accompanied us on the trip, because I considered him to be my wedding companion but now he's just not invited. I proposed to rent an Airbnb with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathroom close to the weeding spot...\n",

All sorts of things just rejecting the idea but also just eliminating herself from the minimum thought of the situation, she said that if that's the plan she would go on other bus, and rent another hotel...I thought this was just exaggerating. Like I'm asking you if it's okay for you, you can just say you prefer it's just the two of us. And for context, I thought we were friends the 3 of us, we have gone multiple times to drink something or I invited her to our house and everything was fine. Also I have gone on trips with my SO and other friends and never had an issue, I'm aware of when you can take your partner and when you cannot. The whole situation was underwhelming. \n",

She literally told me: \n",

      "And I tried to explain to her that I don't want that situation, because we came together, and I also accepted to go on the 10am bus with her, to which she said \"I'm glad that our plans are the same\"(WTFFF)\n",
      "\n",
      "When the trip day came, it was weird to go on a bus with her but we were having a good time...until I said something related to dogs. I said I hated when people had bad behaved dogs and want to let them inside when visitors are around the house. To which she responded:\n",

      "\n",
      "WHAT THE FUCK\n",

      "That instantly made me mad and uncomfortable, I think it ruined the whole trip for me and I became just more serious. She proceeded to give examples of her sister or her cousins but girlllll I don't care, what kind of fucking argument is that if we are speaking about dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the trip was bad, like annoying and bad, in just gonna give you super fast examples. She is egotistical and arrogant, the whole trip she was combing her hair EVEN WHEN DALU'S VOWS WERE HAPPENING, like can you leave your freaking hair a minute, this is an especial moment for our friends.  \n",
      "We went to eat something and she didn't ate with me,  it was fucking weird, I'm sitting eating alone and she's just waiting for me(?) once I finished she said \"finally we can go to burger king\"...\n",

      "She criticized everyone, we stopped at a park at some point to rest and she was badmouthing every one sitting near.\n",
      "Once on the hotel she asked me if she could use the bathroom and I told her yes, just let me take my make up out AND SHE GOT PISSED like a 15 year old. Like if she didn't wanted to use the bathroom anymore because it was not when she wanted.\n",

      "Anyway, our friend Dalu lives in other country so she suggested that we record small videos to update our lives which we did except for Jess, she never sent anything because she doesn't like photos or looking at herself on camera.

      "No, fuck you. I just ghosted the entire group chat since then, Dalu sended me private messages apologizing which is fine, I'm not that mad at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with Jess I'm just fucking done, she is the worst friend I coul ever had, and I feel too stupid to realice just know. 15 years of friendship ti the trash, maybe it wasn't even a friendship it was just me letting her always get her way.\n",

      "Title: I (22F) am not inlove with my my husband (M23) anymore. I don’t know what to do\n",
      "Body text: Me and my husband have been married for almost 4 years now. He’s a narcissist, he has been physically, sexually (depriving to gain power and validation) emotionally and financially abusive a majority of our marriage. I’ve made posts regarding the details previously, I am and have been extremely unhappy in my marriage from the beginning. Well..I made a leap, and I decided to leave him a couple months ago. We live in Alaska, and I moved to Oregon for a few months. Well, he visited me in Oregon and begged to see me. I did, and I was surprised at the man he was. After he left, we started texting again. Eventually it turned into him agreeing to do therapy, promising to be better to me and better himself. He made some huge promises..saying he’ll never lay hands on me, and that he’ll be less hostile and more affectionate, not abandon me so often (he works on his fishing boat an hour away from home, he decides his own hours and often wakes up at 7am and comes home at 2am..other than that, he fishes all the time and rarely texts or calls me) and that he’ll continue doing therapy and that whatever I have issues with in his behavior-I could communicate them and he’ll work on it with the help of therapy..\n",
      "\n",
      "So I came back…\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he has not harmed me. Yes, he is really trying to be more affectionate and soft and romantic, yes he’s trying to hear my feelings out most of the time…but he’s still really mean at times randomly, he’s still super critical of me, he said that he has a huge problem with me communicating what I need him to change and work on in therapy, and at first he came home earlier as promised…but now he’s just back to working long long hours, leaving me abandoned again. He was listening to my problems at first but now he’s started saying “could you just sum up your feelings in 1 word” and when I explain that my feelings are more complex than just 1 word, he gets angry at me. He falls asleep when I’m crying next to him. He doesn’t ever wanna have sex once again, and it leaves me deprived even when I communicate my need for more intimacy. When he’s home, he acts like a dead fish and isn’t as affectionate like ever. I feel like everything is going back to the way it once was. When I tell him this, he calls me and makes me feel like I’m crazy. And I came back very hesitantly anyway, and now I just feel like his actions are chipping away more and more at my already broken heart. I’m laying here all alone, deprived of love, just unsure of what to do. I’m in a religion where divorce is VERY looked down upon…so if I divorce him, my friends and family will literally disown me. Theyll stop associating with me, stop talking to me. It’s such a scary leap, one of the big reason I even came back. \n",

But T is a good friend of mine, he helped me make the leap to leave my husband..saying that I don’t deserve any of it. When I came out there and wasn’t with my husband, he cheered me up and showed me softness. He made me feel so beautiful and cherished and like I was golden. We talked often, we had lots in common. We laughed ugly laughs together and had so many inside jokes. He showed me maturity…when I hinted i was going through lady issues and wasn’t feeling well, he flat out addressed my period as something not to be ashamed of..he even brought me food and a milkshake and danced to music in his vehicle with me. My husband is very disgusted even thinking about the fact I have a period, so this was shocking behavior for me to experience from another man. It’s like my sickness went away. We kissed, and he didn’t act disgusted like my husband always does. He made me feel sooo precious again. Absolutely warmed my heart. He talked about leaving the religion with me, and how he loves kids and would love to raise mine with him. He was just so sweet and he made me feel so good. I wanted to runaway with him, but I became too afraid. I told him everything I was going through every step of the way with my husband, he even tried giving me advice on how to make it work with him, poor thing. I know he really wanted us to be together. When I came back to my husband, I just never got anything close to that softness. All of that was ripped away due to my decision to avoid a bad reputation and try and make it work with him. \n",

I feel so awful for these emotions that I have because I’ve always been so deathly loyal to my husband…but I just feel like I’m not in love anymore.

      "\n",
      "So my **GF (21)F** moved to Senegal last month for a 3 months internship in international relations (its a way to finish her course at her uni), we've been together for about a year and a half and everything as far as I know is doing great (we tell each other we love each other everyday, send good morning and goodnight texts, go on dates etc.). I **(20)M** recently she had feelings for some 40 year old man in senegal , that's been driving her and her friend around in Senegal for free, she also told me that they kissed , apparently they were very drunk and she forgot about it, (she did that arround 2 weeks ago and didnt tell me). So tonight she was driving arround with him in his car , and he told her he was in love with her , she kinda freaked out and directly texted me as soon as she got home. We had a discussion about it and she told me she was sorry and wanted to talk it out, but she also had feelings for him, (apparently he's kind and has a good soul), I told her to stop texting him and she said it would be hard to not talk to him since he's driving her arround and she works with him too and she's not sure of her feelings either. She said to me she would love to live in Senegal and has nothing back in Montreal, she's been considering staying in senegal with him and escape her family (wich is a fair point because there's a lot of emotional abuse). All I know about her \\*crush\\* is that he's arround 40, he's nice and is having a decent life in Senegal. So how do I move on from, well this mess. I'm not mad at her , people can have crushes and everything I'm not the jealous type, but the fact that she was talking to him for well over a month and didn't tell me anything  is honestly soul crushing . So how do I move on from that , my first thought was to leave her and handle the consequences of her actions (but its just a kiss so I don't really care that much) , she says she loves me and everything but it falls a bit flat after leaving me in the dark for so long. (She also has feelings for him)  .So how do I move on from that , do I talk to her and let her live her life, or do I try and salvage that ship.\n",

      "Body text: # Me (39m) Wife (40f) is depressed and its is my fault. We have three kids, 16, 14, and 11. I'm very distressed because I want my kids to grow up in a loving home. Sadly, My wife and I had marital trouble early in the marriage. We were unfaithful to each other before we had children and the resentment has surfaced in the past 8 years. I fear she has been depressed without me knowing for a very long time now. There are so many triggers that set her off and this usually results in her making a series of accusations, that although founded, she wants to discuss all night long and into the next day. There seems to be no end in sight as this has been going on for years now. I'm exhausted. I want to give my children a good home and I've been failing miserably. I know both our actions had consequences that are impacting our kids. I for the most part have accepted what happened and have decided to move past it for the sake of the kids. Her on the other hand is having a very difficult time. She has had dark thoughts in the past. The mood cycles are killing me. She is angry, sad, leaves, comes back, makes demands, threatens divorce... I just want to reduce the collateral damage as much as possible.. My kids are great kids. We both love them very much. They do not know their mom is depressed, or why she is depressed, but of course, they are witnessing her just leave out of the blue and she sleeps on the couch often, so they know something is up, just not the details or how bad it is. I can't even bring myself to enjoy activities with them because I'm constantly anxious, sleep deprived trying to be supportive of her, and honestly, just feels very crappy when she is not there and I just know that we are in for a hellish 1 or two weeks until it sorta passes and then starts again the next month or so. I don't know if I should confide to the kids that their mom is depressed and I don't know how much I should tell them. I obviously do not want to make her out to be the villain. She will not see a therapist. That just won't happen. She goes over and over the same mistakes, although never really taking accountability for her transgressions. I just listen and try to deescalate because I want to avoid the chaos.. Divorce is not an options because in her condition, I fear that it would be worse for her and also the kids since I have a gut feeling that the depression will not go away after the divorce and then the kids will be the ones to pick up the pieces.\n",

I'm religious, she's not. I want to have several children in the future, and she probably doesn't want any. I'm mostly sober, and she drinks/smokes frequently.

Not in a manipulative \"if you break up with me I'll be miserable\" kind of way, just out of sincere affection and appreciation.

An year ago we decided to buy a house there and we made a mistake by buying an expensive house whose monthly mortgage is very high (around $10,000 every month for 20 years). And I want to admit that it was because I pushed him to buy that house even though he didn't like the price since it looked good and huge in a prime area. We definitely back then didn't make enough to afford to pay the monthly mortgage and also live a good comfortable life since we also needed to invest for our retirement. My husband felt forced and went for a job switch to increase his pay and is now working in a company with a very toxic work culture (I can't name the company because they might fire my husband if they found out).

When we were about to buy the house and he still refused that one told him that I was about to get a promotion which would increase my pay. But due to bad market I didn't get my promotion (at least that is what my manager told me.) He then told me to leave the company and search for a one with higher pay but I told that I prioritized work-life balance over pay and that I didn't want to leave my company(Google). I actually gave him a statement instead of understanding him. He now makes around 80% more than me with significantly more stress and I feel like he carries a lot of financial burden now.\n",

      "Title: I (20F) am upset that my boyfriend's (20M) conservative Christian parents (45M & F) won't let me hang out in my boyfriend's room. How can I tell them that I am sick of this treatment?\n",
      "Body text: Recently, I have had some issues with the way my boyfriend's parents set rules regarding our relationship. My boyfriend and I have had many conversations concerning his parents over the last week and we are unsure about what to do so here we are asking Reddit lol. He is also not happy with their decisions, however is of the opinion that it is \"their house and their rules \" so he isn't as upset about it as I am. My mom also agrees with my boyfriend on the concept of \"their house their rules\" and says I shouldn't rock the boat while my best friends are all passionately on my side (I have very good friends haha) so I'm even more split on what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "For background, I (20F) and my boyfriend, Nate (20M), have been together for almost 3 years and have been long distance for 2 of those 3 years for college. We go to college about 5 hours apart, both with intensive majors, so we only saw each other two weekends a month when I drove to stay with him since he didn't have a car until recently. Despite this, our relationship is very strong and we spend most of our time on FaceTime including between classes, doing work, driving, and even sleeping. Nate and I are the bestest of friends and we have no problems in our relationship other than this current issue. Before you ask, yes we have petty disagreements all the time but never stay mad for longer than an hour because we have great communication and an overall amazing relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "My relationship with Nate's parents, Frank (45M) and Caroline (45F) is also amazing, aside from my current feelings over this situation. They loved me even before we started dating and I have been invited for many vacations with them and am over at his house all the time even when Nate's not there. I have a great relationship with every member of his family including his siblings, grandparents, cousins, etc. Caroline and I are especially close, and as Nate and I are the eldest child of our families, our younger siblings often hang out with us all together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the issue. Over the course of our relationship, Nate has gone out of town for better paid summer jobs so this is the first year we will be able to spend a full summer together and we are super excited to do so. This is relevant because its the first time we are able to see each other regularly since high school while both of us live at home because while I go to school near our hometown, he has moved to the town he goes to college in. I've become upset with the way his parents have been setting rules in our relationship and feel that they are treating us as if we are still kids in high school. \n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest issue with his parents is that they won't allow us to hang out in his room together. Recently, we were playing video games on our respective laptops in his room with the door wide open when Caroline sent him a text that we needed to move to a different room, since we aren't allowed to be in there. This is how his parents always go about setting boundaries in our relationship, by sending him a text, having him inform me, and then they never speak about it to me. He and I were both frustrated by this, especially since his room is literally central to the house's floorplan with it being near the office, stairs, and front door, but didn't argue and moved to the dining room. Later that evening, another problem arose, where his parents reinstated their boundary of kicking me out of the house before they go to bed, which they also had while we were in high school. We were hanging out in the dining room at around 11pm with Nate on his laptop and I working on an art project, when they again sent him another text saying it was time for me to leave. I wanted to finish the color I was currently working on, as I had just sprawled out the materials for it, but because he didn't want to get yelled at by his parents, he started packing up my materials for me so I could get out faster. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is also not the only issue that has arose this week either. Nate, at 20 years old, still is required to come home at whatever time his parents text him to be back from my house. This includes to run errands for them or as a curfew which can be anytime from 9:30-midnight depending on when they plan on going to bed that evening. This is because they say he must be home before they go to bed so they can \"lock up\". I find that excuse extremely frustrating as Nate has the ability to get in the house when it is locked through a garage door app on his phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that has really frustrated me is they have started to make concessions on their rules, so long as they have a good excuse for them. The most recent revelation, is that Nate is now allowed to spend the night at my house, but again only if there is a good reason. These reasons have ranged from weather, to hiding gifts from him, and to needing to use his bedroom for someone else to sleep in. However I am not allowed to stay the night at his house and he cannot stay at mine without any good reason, trust me I've tried. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I am allowed to stay the weekend at his residence that they pay for in his college town and we have even stayed a week at his family's Airbnb alone at Caroline's suggestion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We run into at least one of these issues pretty much once a day and I'm really tired of it. After last week when I was essentially kicked out, I had a good cry about it and spoke to Nate on the phone about how much everything was upsetting me and he agreed that he needed to have a conversation with his parents. That conversation however, went nowhere and even though Nate informed them about how upset I was, they just told him that we needed to respect their rules. Again they never spoke to me about anything even though it is a week later, Caroline just asked me why I haven’t been over this week when I picked something up from their house today and I just told her I was busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that we got out of the conversation is that their reasoning for this is to \"set a good example\" for his younger siblings, since they will be dating their own partners soon. For reference, again Nate and I are the oldest, we each have one sibling in high school, each one sibling in middle school, and Nate has one more sibling of toddler age. His toddler age sibling is one that we babysit individually and often together, especially when no one is home. That's another concession as well, Nate and I are allowed to hangout at his or my house when no one is there, which adds more frustration to my dilemma. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't understand how these rules that they have never set in stone are setting an example for his younger siblings especially when his parents break them all the time. I'm just afraid that these rules will never change even as our relationship gets more serious as Nate and I plan on getting engaged within the next year and have made that well known to our families. Both of our families are over the moon over this news and Caroline seems to be extremely excited which is another reason why I can't understand why they set such rules on my boyfriend and I's relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "So reddit, do I keep my mouth shut and just be happy with whatever bones they throw me or do I finally speak up to them about how hurt I've been recently? Are my feelings even valid in this scenario or am I just overacting? \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend's parents limit our relationship through curfews and time alone but often break their own rules if they have a good enough reason despite our relationship being serious enough to get engaged within a year. \n",

      "Body text: Me (19M) and my girlfriend, let’s call her R (18F) have seen dating for a couple months. RIGHT before we started dating, R and her best friend, call her E (18F), planned a trip to the beach for senior week (I graduated last year). At the time they booked it, E had a boyfriend and was bringing him along. R made a comment or two about it, and E said something along the lines of “don’t worry we’ll find you a man when we’re there.” Now for some context, E is a very self absorbed person. Fast forward to now, E got dumped by her boyfriend, and R brought up the idea of bringing me along on this trip, but E denied, saying she wants it to be a “girls only” trip. This seems a little hypocritical of her considering she was planning on bringing her boyfriend at first. I don’t think R has mentioned it again, only the once. To be completely honest, I’m feeling left out and not entirely comfortable with R being in a party city with her self absorbed and party loving friend for almost a whole week. I feel bad for wanting to bring this up to R because I feel like I’m inviting myself and overstepping. What should I do?\n",

Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid.

      "Body text: I (32F) have been with my fiancé (35M) for several years.

I said it calmly and clearly—not in anger or blame. His response? He walked away and wouldn’t make eye contact. Later, he said he felt “blindsided” and was angry that I “sprung it on him.”\n",

      "Body text: My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n",

      "They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families.

They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal.

I don’t brush it off or minimize her feelings, but I don’t take it personally when she raises her voice when speaking to me or says intentionally hurtful things. That being said, growing up with a father that was abusive towards my mother, I fear what I’m capable of if I experienced years of this, although I believe that fear has kept me far far away from acting that way. \n",

      "Our date was originally 3 months ago. I decided that we needed to postpone things because we were absolutely not “ready” when I’d seen some of her most violent behavior weeks prior. From driving to my house at 3 in the morning to throwing her phone at me. Now we’re about 3 months away. I feel we need couple’s counseling and we both need to see things in this relationship before that point.\n",

      "All of that to say this- I have a house about 10 minutes away from her in a town she loathes. She lives in her parents house, which they are actively trying to sell. When we decided to postpone the wedding back in February, it was with the agreement that we’d look to sell my house and buy one in her town because she hates the town I’m in (haven’t QUITE heard a legitimate reason, but 🤷‍♂️). So this has led to her giving me the ultimatum last week that, since you can expect it to take months to sell a house, if I don’t put my house up for sell, it’s over. I bought this house in 2019 at a 4% interest rate, nearly half of today’s rates, and looking at things objectively, this would be the worst financial decision I’ve ever made. But, there was a time where I would be willing to make that sacrifice to make her happy. I think that the things that I’ve seen over the last few months may have eroded that. \n",

He didn’t do a lot of work on his mental health over the past 2 years and recently trickle truthed me about some bad decisions he had been making for the past year that we had discussed when marrying and agreed would be cheating behavior.

      "\n",
      "In the past he has also voiced displeasure about my tattoos and piercings and made passive-aggressive “jokes” about removing them and outright stated he doesn’t feel attracted to those things or want them in a wife. Mind you, I had 5 tattoos and several piercings when we met and have been respectful about not getting any big tattoos since but upon voicing how I want to get more, he called them horrible and his expression and body language seemed disgusted. If I had known our difference in values then, when he should have but didn’t voice them, I wouldn’t have continued the relationship but here we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "My issue isn’t how he feels but how he is voicing it and his only focus being on how my physical appearance might harm theoretical future children despite me being a lovely person who takes pride in personal growth with full faith that I would do an amazing job raising children while considering I’ve never done it so I can only assume. I feel he is blaming me for things that haven’t happened and would not be fair to blame on me if they did.

I set a boundary that I need to be with someone that can be honest and look me in the eyes and tell me the truth and she still wouldn’t. Truthfully a very immature and childish response from her during the conversation. Like you could tell she wanted to tell me but she said she can’t do it. When I told her I couldn’t be with someone who wouldn’t tell me to face the truth, her response.. “I can’t be with someone who is threatening our relationship, get out” ..

But I didn’t know how to tell you bc i felt like that was a part in why liked me. I only had 45 days to take the nclex and obviously now it’s past that. So I have to take another semester in the fall that’s only 6 weeks and then I’m finally all set. But all the work stories I’ve told you are true and I’m a nurse tech for now. I’m sorry. I think I was too ashamed to just be out of school and when I fell in love with you I didn’t know how to tell you because I know it would change everything.

      "I 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.\n",

      "Body text: Husband (48M) and I (45F) have been married 20 years.  3 kids.  I was more educated, but he had more earning potential, so he's full time breadwinner and I'm a dedicated SAHM.\n",

      "* He is a tremendous father to our kids.  Loves kids, spends hours each week with each kid hanging out or helping them troubleshoot emotional, social, etc. issues. He's spent time coaching their sports teams. I send a lot of the kid issues to him nowadays because he's usually more patient and insightful with them.\n",
      "* He's a good earner.  We have a good home in a good neighborhood and school district.  It's not enough that we don't have to be responsible, but it's enough that we don't have to worry (\\~$250k/yr).\n",

      "* His sleep schedule is atrocious.  He usually plays video games until 3am and sleeps until 9am (he doesn't need much sleep?)\n",
      "* His hygiene is poor.  He works from home 40-50 hrs/week, so he only showers when he needs to leave the house, which is a few times per week.  His brushing isn't great either. He often forgets deodorant and he stinks up our room.  We're both obese, but we're both working on it.\n",
      "* He has porn-induced ED.  He masturbates almost every day, mostly with softcore pics and stories.  He gave up hardcore stuff years back.  But his masturbation isn't anything like intercourse, and when it's time for us to be intimate, he can't stay hard and often takes 30+ minutes to finish.  We have sex every couple months (mostly when I initiate, he says he's afraid to), and the sex is nice. But we haven't had intercourse in 9+ years.\n",
      "* He doesn't do much, if any housework.  He has his own physical/injury issues that limit him. But he just doesn't see it or take any ownership of it.  I'm so tired of doing all of it.\n",
      "* I'm constantly disappointed by how thoughtless he is about me.  He says he can't read my mind, but it just feels like he doesn't care or think about me hardly at all. I feel lonely.\n",

      "When it's just the two of us and he's focused on me, it can be lovely. I love it when we go away for a weekend together and he's focused just on me and we fall in love again. I can't see leaving him, but I guess a part of me wants/expected better from my marriage.\n",

But the minute he sees me he asks me why I'm wearing this, said I don't look good, that I should lose weight if I want to wear such clothing and it looks awkward, that I should just wear loose clothing till I lose weight. This time I didn't even bother responding to what he said and just nodded, gave him a thumbs up and we continued on about our day. But he couldn't let it go.

My boyfriend (26M) works full-time as a medical professional, and we live with his grandparents in their house.\n",

      "We dated for a few months initially, I ended it for awhile because I felt that we weren’t getting along, but he asked to start going out again and told me that he would work on himself.

But lately, he’s been treating me really poorly, especially in the mornings before work.\n",

      "Body text: We've been together for the past 5 years - married for 3. Nearly half of our entire relationship she hasn't worked. I've had numerous talks with her about this issue because she has finished Law school and seems to not want to work in that direction. Fine, okay. That's her prerogative and choice. However, when we sit down and review the budget and I explain to her that we currently have no financial difficulties for everyday life needs but we cannot save any money or go on even cheap vacations and this is putting a strain on me - she suggests we make her a resume so we can start searching for a job for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the issue lies, however, is that she doesn't want to sit down with me and write this. She esentially wants me to do this by myself. She says she has never made one and she can't do it alone. My problem is she has never even tried making one before giving up. This sounds very much like weaponized incompetence to me and I told her so. Our arguments lead to nowhere but bitterness after a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all came to a head when we were together with the in-laws yesterday. She was explaining an argument we had prior to the gathering.  The argument was about some tiles that needed to be picked up as they were going to be laid for our new apartment. The shop had told me the tiles were to be delivered at 5pm on Friday. After talking with my wife I told her I wish to do this pick-up on Monday as I was dead tired to pick up some tiles alone that weren't going to be put until Monday anyway. She didn't accept that and her argument was that I didn't ask for her opinion on the matter. My reply was curt and rude - I told her that no matter her opinion on the matter I wasn't going to do it. This all spiraled and lead to the night in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the gathering with the in-laws my wife was explaining all of this. My wife's sister upon hearing the story said I wasn't in the right and that I had no right to speak like that to her. This lead to a full-blown argument where I said that we have no children and my wife isn't working. All I want from her is some leeway on these issues as I feel overtired working alone. She has no driver's license by choice so whenever she has stuff to do I go pick her up and we do it. I have a great job working with my father so I do this during working hours when I'm free, as well. This has put some further resentment from me as she can do these stuff alone but she doesn't want to. She says that I only think about myself and my needs and not hers, whenever I express I don't want to do this every time. BUT IM SO FUCKING TIRED. The stress of having to work for 2 people in these times is making my head spin. Upon hearing my displeasement with my wife on this issue her sister went feral. Told me she can't believe the words coming out of my mouth and then went on a rant about me telling me if I had such a problem with my wife not working I should just find her a job and make her resume myself. Otherwise, I cannot complain. My wife stood in agreement during all of this. Standing there and being scolded by these people while my wife stood in agreement about not working was making me see red beyond imagination. The irony in all of this is that my wife's sister isn't currently working and her husband is having mental problems having to cope with working a lot and not having enough rest for him.\n",

I met my partner during covid and we fell in love. My dad was ok with it at the start and then when I stayed the night at my partners house, my dad rang me and told me to get home. This was the start of him trying to control me.  Alot of people ask, why does he hate your partner? But I don't think he does, they spent time together. My dad done work for my partner and my partner done work for my dad for years!!! They even went to buy a vehicle together and went for a mountain walk once.

I stuffed them down my bra. If I even tried to use the bathroom, he ordered that i don't lock the door and my mum was to stand guard at the door to ensure I wasn't texting. I was 25 turned 26 years old. I was a teacher. This was insanity to me. A few weeks of this passed, being stalked and followed by my dad. I fled. I parked in my local town and cried. The police parked beside me and asked if everything was OK. I burst out crying and explained, I was being harassed and followed by my dad. Within minutes of this conversation, guess who parked beside us. My dad. The policeman went between me and my dad, asking me if he had any mental health issues. My dad then exclaimed the car I was driving was his. The police advised me due to the safety concerns that I get everything I need out of the car and get into their car, give daddy my car and it can be sorted at a later date. Looking back, I still can't believe I willingly packed my car belongings up and left the car to him. It took weeks but eventually I got my car back with the help of the police and I moved in with my partner. That was only the start of the torment. My dad rang my place of work, he told everyone he came across that I was a drug user ( that was his way of covering why I actually left my family home) I has to justify myself to people that I was not a drug user. I was a teacher. And a very good one st that who had never taken drugs. He also said horrible nasty things about my partner. It was awful. This went on for a few years. Since then I have had a child. My parents first grandchild. My mum (f60) is doting on my child (f1) but my dad has tried multiple times to ban my mum from helping me or my child, from seeing us. For months, I had to meet my mum in my car and her car, away from the town so she could see her grandchild. Recently, ee both decided, enough is enough so I took my child to her grandparents home. My mum was overjoyed but my dad will not even look at my child. He has said he will not have anything to do with her. He wants to basically pretend she doesn't exist. He is now suffering with heart failure. My mum wishes he could see sense but I have honestly got to the point, I don't care. I don't care if he misses out on his only grandchilds life. In fact, he doesn't deserve even a chance really. He has done nothing but cause me hassle stress hurt cost me money, taken things from me (oh yes I forgot to say , he dumped all my childhood keepsakes, clothes, school work, any gifts that were brought to then for my daughter etc or anything I had left with my mum e.g. pram add ons etc he dumped them all, he filled a car trailer with it all and dumped it). \n",

That he will stop spreading slander about me. That he would see sense and try to rebuild some sort of civil relationship. How do I get to this point? It is breaking my poor mums heart.

      "I (30F) have been estranged from my father for years after a long and painful history of abandonment, emotional manipulation, and serious financial harm. My childhood memories with him are vague and mostly superficial—sporadic weekends at karaoke bars or bowling alleys. There was no emotional or financial support, no real presence. I was raised by my mom and sometimes even struggled to have what to eat, and often when he was supposed to pick me up, he wouldn’t show up or would just drop me at my grandmother’s. I was left alone as a child more times than I can count. I eventually stopped wanting to see him at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "We reconnected briefly in my late teens. He asked to refinance a car in my name since I had just turned 18, promising it would be mine once I got my license. I was naive and agreed. Later, I found out the debt was defaulted, my name was ruined, and his then-wife had to pay it off to clear my name. I wasn’t even aware they were married or had a child until after their divorce, when she reached out and told me what she had done to help me. That’s how I found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I insisted he remove the car from my name and I handled all the paperwork—except the final step, which only required him sign a paper and deliver in a specific places. I had classes and couldn’t join, so I trusted him. Years passed. At 22, I went to get permanent driver’s license, only to be told I couldn’t get it due to multiple traffic violations. I hadn’t driven, didn’t own a car, and deliberately waited to avoid this kind of situation. I was in shock. Eventually, I traced the plate to that same car. He never took it off my name. My license was revoked, and I could only reapply in 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotional toll broke me. I was already struggling and this crushed me. My mom and sister (dif dad) helped me forcibly recover the car (which by then was a wreck with no value). I managed to sell it for scraps to help me pay off over $8K of his debts tied to my name. I later discovered his side of the family had known all along (he was receiving all the fines and notices at his home and never told me). They were complicit. I felt violated, humiliated, and betrayed all over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wrecked my credit, cost me job opportunities, and kept me from driving for years. Every time I’ve let him back in, even slightly, it ends with me hurt or set back. After this incident, I completely cut contact. I’d only get texts from him after that on Father’s Day texts or occasional birthday ones, which I ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, he caught COVID and it was serious. He didn’t text, I didn’t visit, but knew from my auntie and I checked on my grandma, sending flowers and offering support. When he recovered, the family held a gathering and didn’t even invite me—not that I would’ve gone, but they didn’t even consider me, despite my efforts to stay respectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in 2023, during a very low period in my life, he messaged me again. He blamed my mom’s family for our distance and acted like he tried to reconnect. I snapped. Told him I make my own choices since I was 10 and he never tried. I listed everything he’d done and what I’ve been through while he never helped. I told him I was exhausted and suicidal, and he didn’t know anything about me. His only reply? “May God have mercy on your soul.”. No follow-up. No concern. Just a cold religious guilt trip that left me worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, we haven’t spoken. And today at 4:30am he texts me saying he’s admitted at hospital, asks for forgiveness, says he loves me, and thanks me “for letting him bring me into this world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the thing: he’s used emotional manipulation his whole life. I don’t know if this is genuine, but I want to reply. But I also don’t want to reopen a wound or invite more pain. Just wish him well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I need advice: What kind of reply can I send without opening the door for more contact? I don’t want to start a new dynamic, just want peace and clear conscience if it’s serious and anything happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My dad has been emotionally and financially harmful, including ruining my credit twice and using his family to hide it. We’ve been mostly non contact for years. Only rare, cold messages from him on Father’s Day or rarely on my bday. The last time I was vulnerable and shared I was suicidal, he responded with complete indifference. Now, after years, he’s hospitalized and texted at 4am asking for forgiveness. I want closure and to wish him well, but I’m scared it’s just another manipulation. How can I respond without opening the door again?\n",

      "Body text: As the title says I think my Gf of 6 months might be toxic and honestly her behaviour is starting to wear me down and drain me.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context I am 22M and my girlfriend 21F met online and have been dating for 6 months roughly and in that time I have very quickly seen her behaviour morph into something that honestly makes me feel like shit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example I enjoy cooking for my partner and I don’t like to live in a dirty environment, so I always cook the food and I always clean up after. In the 6 months we’ve been together she has not offered ONCE to even help out, even when I stay over hers. And don’t get me wrong I enjoy cooking for her but when I have tonsillitis and literally can barely move out of bed, why am I the one cooking HER nuggets? \n",
      "\n",
      "Another example is the fact she has never paid for pretty much anything, once again I don’t like splitting the bill and I enjoy buying gifts, and I am fortunate enough to have a salary that allows to do so most of the time. However it’s to the point that when she wants to order food she just grabs MY phone and doesn’t think twice and has yet to even think about buying me a gift, btw I’ve bought every gift in the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s never once travelled to come see me, we live 30 mins away from each other however she can’t drive, but once again I was sick and STILL made the effort to pick her up from work and she refuses to even begin trying to learn to drive meaning I drive everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also the fact her communication is so infrequent, one day she’ll message me instantly, the next I won’t hear from her for like 8 hours despite not being at work or having no friends and no ability to drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything sexual we do together she’s incredibly selfish, I love giving head to my partner and I’ve been told many times I’m good at it, I take pride in the fact I can pleasure my partner, however she’ll typically want head or to be fingered, and then immediately after refuse to do anything for me. Which I get I’m not entitled to sexual acts but It does kind of make me feel like shit sometimes having to just roll over in bed while she scrolls TikTok after.\n",
      "\n",
      "However I think the thing that bugs me the most is her ability to just snap at me, like yes I like to act childlike sometimes but she will just snap in anger at it. It doesn’t even have to be that multiple times I’ve simply asked her a question and she snapped at me so bad I just went quite out of shock. The few times I have been upset by things she has said, it someone always becomes MY fault and something I should apologise for so I feel like I’m walking on egg shells around my own partner.\n",

The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.\n",

      "Body text: For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?\n",

I do get attention wherever i go so that was never a problem with me but I do understand wanting the feeling of someone liking you. We are very comfortable with each other, he worships me and loves me but I think all the years he spent alone (im his first girlfriend) and unwanted(?) made him feel insecure.

      "Body text: I’m in a situation that feels like no matter what choice I make, I lose something important to me, and I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I 'F35' met my boyfriend 'M40' on Reddit at the end of 2020. I had gotten out of a bad long-term relationship a couple of months before, and talking to men on Reddit felt like a nice, easy way to dip my toe in the water without expecting it to be more. I assumed we’d chat a little, it’d be something to do during the pandemic, and it’d fizzle out in a couple of weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it didn’t fizzle out. And I ended up moving to NYC in 2021 for work from the Midwest, and he was in Boston. It took a long time to pull the trigger, but we met for the first time in 2022. We were long-distance for a year, traveling between the two cities. I was working a new job that is fully remote, and I offered to move to Boston to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told anyone who would listen that New York was never my end game. But I did love it deeply. I honestly felt like the city belonged to me. I had an incredible group of friends, I was having the best time, and I just felt so alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite visiting a number of times before moving... it didn’t take long for me to realize that Boston just wasn’t it for me. Everywhere I looked, there was a comparison to New York, with New York coming out on top every time. I moved in September, and by April, I was really miserable and told my partner I hated it here. My attempts at making friends, which I hadn’t been worried about at all, came up short. I live too far out in Cambridge for public transportation to feel easy. My once-per-hour bus or 30-minute walk to the train just didn’t cut it. I missed Broadway shows. I missed having access to every type of food imaginable, everything a world-class city offers. I could go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in April of last year, I shared how unhappy I was with my partner. He asked me for one more year in Cambridge so that he could meet the 3-year requirement for his 401k to vest. I agreed without hesitation- it was a super fair compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outwardly, you probably wouldn’t know that I hate it here. The best part of Boston is getting *out* of Boston, so basically every weekend, we get out of the city... we visit coastal towns, we go to the cape, we go hiking... and I never complain. I can enjoy all those things and it still not be \\*enough\\*, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "I think, for me, if Boston were cheaper, I’d be more content here, but I hate paying New York prices for so much less than New York has to offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March, we started talking about what would happen at the end of our lease, and I reaffirmed that I wanted to go back to New York and that he had agreed a year ago to go with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many pieces and intricacies. So many nuances and so much grey area. It’ll never be black and white. You need to know that he’s a widower and that he has years of memories with his late wife in Boston. You need to know that (though never diagnosed), he is likely a little neurodivergent and struggles with change and has social anxiety. You need to know that he works a hybrid position and isn’t sure they’d allow him to go remote. You also need ot know that I make enough money to support us both should he be let go.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to me, we made a deal. He disagrees. But to me, not going to New York is going back on his word. To me, staying in Boston signifies that I'll be the one bending for the rest of our lives. That he couldn’t just try it for me. That’s all I’m asking. That he tries. And if he tried and hated it, we would find somewhere else, and we’d make that decision together. But at least try.... \n",
      "\n",
      "And he’s not willing to try. He said he can’t leave, and I know it’s related to the memories he holds. I obviously don’t know how it FEELS, but I CAN understand and empathize with how gut-wrenching it would be to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him that I couldn’t stay. I want to go back, and I’ve begged him to come with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sitting here in tears, truly not knowing what to do. A few days ago, it felt clear as day... I have to go back, I have to put myself first. But I love him so much. The way we got to know each other all those years ago... there was no expectation of it ever being more, so we were our pure, unfiltered selves. And I don’t think anyone has ever known me the way that he knows me. And I don’t want to lose him.\n",

      "Title: My girlfriend (19F) wants me (19M) choose between her or my family\n",
      "Body text: Me and my girlfriend have been together for a bit over two years. This starts with me complaining about my mum to my girlfriend. The average \"my mums always telling to do this, my mums always telling me to do that, etc\", the typical complaining about a mum you'd expect from someone my age and that led my girlfriend to not like my mum so much. Now my mum does social work as her job so she's picked up on small behaviours my girlfriend has shown that she didn't like (locking me and my mum in her car once however I saw that as just a habit, leaving me to do all the cleaning after I've cooked for her, things like that) so it's led my mum not to like my girlfriend too much either. Now my girlfriend really disliking my mum reached its peak when my mum asked her to leave my house after she was at my place uninvited while my mum wasn't home (she asked me to tell her to leave once she got home.) now my girlfriend drove off and then I complained about my mum and apologised to her that she had to leave but then my girlfriend drives back to my house enraged then as my mum is outside watering plants out the front of my house she has a go at her asking if they can go inside and talk (in which my mum says no). They have a very heated argument while I just stand there and watch in shock because I've never seen anything like it (while the neighbours watch). Then my girlfriend goes to drive off she yells at the top of her lungs \"if you continue to live here, I can't be with you anymore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have nowhere else to go, I can't move in with my dad because I don't have enough money to pay for rent at his place and frankly I don't want to (he lives in a shared home and would have to give up his bed for me, I don't want him to do that.) Now she has apologised a lot for her actions but the damage has been done. Everytime I close my eyes all I see and hear is her yelling at me and I have nightmares about her every night. And now that my family hates my girlfriend for having a go at my mum in broad daylight, I now feel like I'm in a situation where I have to choose either my family or my girlfriend and I want to choose my family. Our relationship has never been ideal really as I've had to cut off pretty much every female I've ever had contact with to stop her from overthinking, she doesn't help herself when it comes to her mental health issues but we managed to make it work due to me being willing to sacrifice a lot. She keeps sending me videos/tik toks making me feel guilty for wanting to break up with her (I tried a couple weeks ago but wasn't successful). I feel like I'm betraying my family just by being around her and I can't see our relationship going anywhere and I'm also very quickly losing the connection I have for her. Messaging her now feels like a chore but when I see her in person I don't feel so bad about it. I really don't know how to go about this and would love some advice.\n",

      "Body text: I (F27) and my fiance (M28) have finally decided to get married after 12 years of being together. I know it’s been a long time, but we got together at 16 and lots of things have happened in the time in-between. Even though he asked me to marry him 7 years ago, and besides the fact we had a child and COVID and other things affected how long it took, I also was not mentally ready to get married. But I decided last year that 2025 would be the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I attempted to tell my family that I would like to do a wedding this years couple months back. For further context, my older sister is pregnant with her second child and younger sister is graduating HS- so i understand my family has stuff going on. I did not want a big crazy wedding, just a reception with my friends and family- I planned to keep it under 75 people. I was told “can we just do it next year?”. This really angered me, especially since my older sister got married last year and she basically had the whole year about her. So my fiance and I decided, maybe it was us being spiteful, that we don’t want to do much of anything- just do a very simple ceremony with very very close family and a couple friends and then go on a nice trip for a long weekend. I had also realized that after my sisters wedding last year, it was all too much for me. The planning, the expenses, the time, and I also have developed some serious social anxiety as I’ve gotten older and stage fright. \n",

It just doesn’t seem like anyone cares and it honestly hurts me. \n",

      "I’ve been friends with a girl for about 5 years now. We are very close and I consider her one of my best friends. However, one of her biggest flaws is that she always needs the attention to be on her in a group setting. She’s great one-on-one, we have fun together and have supported each other through our roughest times. But when she gets around large groups, I cannot stand her. She’ll very obviously flirt with men and then be shocked when they start to like her. She blatantly flirted with my ex in front of me (not because she likes him but because his attention was on me and she would do anything for it to be on herself) but she’ll do these things in a strategically subtle way where if someone points it out they’ll look the crazy one. \n",

      "The worst thing for me about this is birthdays. We went to dinner for my birthday last year and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. She told me the story earlier that day, and she didn’t seem sad at all about it, at least outwardly.  At dinner, she decided to spill the news about the breakup to the rest of the group, and spent basically the whole dinner talking in detail about the story. I left feeling really unappreciated but didn’t say anything because I wanted to be there for her. Last week was another one of my friends’ birthday and we went to dinner. She had been apartment hunting for a while and recently found a suitable apartment to move into. Again, she told me this earlier in the day and she showed me the virtual tour and talked in detail about the location, looked at it on Google earth, etc. But then at dinner, she decided to drop the news that she found a new apartment to the group and everyone asked to see it and she ended up giving everyone the virtual tour again on her phone, until we got our food which was about 45 mins. Meanwhile it seemed like no one was paying any attention to the birthday girl. I tried diverting the topic to ask the birthday girl something and my friend always found a way to bring the conversation back herself. The frustrating part is that I feel like I’m the only one who sees it happening - everyone else indulges in her behavior. \n",

I want to know how I can handle this - is there a way that I can not indulge in her story to make her tell it faster or for it to not be the main topic of conversation? Any tips on how to handle this?\n",

      "\n",

      "This lead to me doing unhealthy things like turning off my emotions, disassociating or hurting myself.  Their episodes last from 20 minutes to hours at a time, and can range anywhere from crying, to punching themselves, cutting themselves and even suicide attempts (it happened when I was at work once, and I still haven't processed it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times their episodes take priority over mine own, unless mine are really bad. Usually if mine gets bad enough they will do their best to hold and take care of me. I've been good at handling their episodes for almost two years, but recently I've been getting worse and worse at handling them. Most recently (reason I'm making this post), I had a bad episode after theirs, and they started screaming at me and grabbing me hard, telling me to help/hold them over and over. I was having such a bad panic attack that I kept just repeating the same thing over and over. At one point I was lying on the floor trying to hold on to reality, and they walked up to me, made sure I was looking at them, and then sliced their legs with scissors, very hard. \n",

      "I still can't believe they did that to me, it was almost like they were punishing me for not taking care of them correctly in that moment. I've been thinking about breaking up with them even more since then. I love them so much and it would disrupt our lives so much for us to break up. We've been living together along with my brother, his fiance and their kids. If they left I'd have to cover all of their rent. Not to mention all of the friends and family I'd lose in the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern is them hurting or killing themselves. They've told me many times that they're going to kill themselves soon, and I have to be ready. If I leave them they just might do it, and it would be my fault. I feel so selfish for even thinking of leaving them, but my mental health and sanity has been taking a toll for so long.

I was in a great headspace and good mood due to the festival. We met at a burger restaurant the day I got back. From the moment she sat down she had a pretty bad attitude... asking me if I had been looking at other girls when I was away, if I had spoke to anyone, questioned why I spoke to a few couples and randoms. After we finished the burger, we stopped off at the shop to get some snacks for home, I said I have some bananas in my bag if we want to make banana bread, she immediately shut me down saying we don't have the ingredients (when we're in the store, we can just buy them), I said ok no problem, let's grab something else and go home.\n",

      "We then face timed and met up, a couple of days later. I reiterated that I won't tolerate that behaviour. She pushes back saying I am just walking out and won't be there for her, and that next time I can keep walking. She asks for examples of when she's spoke to me like that.

      "Body text: I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n",

Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people.

I was so...puzzled, I guess, that I didn't even know how to react. And the last time I visited, I caught my father snooping in my medication. These are pretty typical examples of how they violate my boundaries and try to control me. It seems that if they think they're being helpful, they don't care about anything else. I have had so many conversations with them about their issues, and usually, they accomplish nothing. I learned today that my nephew/their grandson is coming to visit them. I communicated with both parents that I'm thinking about joining for the visit, but the boundary problems are a concern. Also, that I may only come back to visit once/year due to the lack of progress in addressing the concerns. I was clear with both that my goal is to protect the relationship.

      "\n",
      "Here’s what I’ve been going through:\n",
      "\t•\tHe started criticizing how I talk, how I sit, how I look at him, how I even blink sometimes. He says I look “attacking” without saying anything. That my tone is disrespectful even when I’m just trying to explain.\n",
      "\t•\tHe constantly says I don’t have manners, that I’m not cultured, or that I don’t come from a good enough background. He even once gave me an old-fashioned etiquette book and suggested I “start from the basics” and stop wasting time on my interests.\n",
      "\t•\tHe makes me feel like I’m always failing. He doesn’t say it outright, but the way he acts, it’s like he truly believes I’m beneath him. It’s not even manipulative at this point—it feels like he’s just disgusted by who I am.\n",
      "\t•\tHe often says I can’t be a part of a “real family” like his. That I wouldn’t last in his home. That I was raised wrong and that’s why I behave the way I do. These aren’t heat-of-the-moment things. He says them like facts. And after a while, I’ve started believing it.\n",
      "\t•\tIf I bring up how I feel, he says I’m being too emotional, or that I’m playing the victim. If I say nothing, I’m giving attitude. If I ask a question, I’m challenging him. It’s like no matter what I do, I’m wrong.\n",
      "\t•\tHe blocks me whenever we argue. He shuts me out, disappears, and then waits for me to chase him, apologize, and fix it. And I always do. I can’t help myself. It’s like I’m addicted to proving to him that I’m not what he says I am.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’s extremely close to his mother, and I’ve always been made to feel like I’m competing with her. If I try to speak up about how I feel about that dynamic, I’m told I’m disrespecting his family. Meanwhile, I’ve felt guilty for even wanting time with my own parents.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’s never once apologized for anything, even when he’s been cruel. He once punched a mirror during a fight and said it was “because of me.” When I get upset, he mocks me or just tells me I need to calm down. I feel like my emotions are used against me every time.\n",
      "\t•\tThere have been times he’s gotten in my face, raised his voice, said things I still hear in my head days later. Things like how I need to learn my place, or that I shouldn’t speak unless I know how to. Even when I cry, he acts like I’m putting on a show.\n",
      "\t•\tHe’ll be loving again, and just when I think things are okay, he’ll find something small to fight about and say it’s over again. It’s like he breaks up with me every time I forget to keep my head down.\n",
      "\t•\tI’ve tried to leave more times than I can count. I’ve lasted a few hours, maybe a day. Then I’m right back—texting him, apologizing, trying to calm him down. I hate that I do it. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m addicted to him.\n",

When we met, she had just gone through a breakup that she clearly wasn’t over. While I thought she was cute, I didn’t want to be a rebound. After about 6 months of climbing together and growing closer, we both caught feelings and started dating.\n",

I think just before the time we started dating, she gave him her number right in front of me (framing it as a new friendship and possible person to outdoor climb with—I’m not big on going outdoors but she is). \n",

Things like “I almost feel obligated to climb outside with X since he’s so strong”. Or “oh him and I text all the time, he invites me out all the time”. Though she’d never accept the invitations, she also seemed very excited by him. She also talks about her ex a lot, who I don’t think she’s quite over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve bottled in some discomfort, but X recently approached us while we were climbing. He asked her to go outside (not me). She got super excited. Granted, she asked if I wanted to come along, but would have gone otherwise. I said yes in the moment. So we have plans to now.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I tried to explain my discomfort to her. Telling her that it’s likely he invites her out and constantly texts her because he’s interested to some extent. She’s telling me she’s just making new climbing friends, but that they talk all the time and finds their conversations hysterical. I asked if he knew we were dating, to which she said she figured so because we see each other at the gym, but she’s never straight up told him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Immaturely, I started talking about a girl friend of mine more often and I asked how if she’d feel fine if I was always texting other women and being invited out by them. She responded that she wouldn’t care and wouldn’t care if I dated someone else honestly. Which stung. But also felt like her hiding her true feelings of caring. Couldn’t tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first started dating she’d always tell me about how guys only want her for sex or dating (she’s gorgeous) and that she is uncomfortable getting to know guys frequently because of this. But she’s getting to know quite a few recently (again, some of which I know and are cool with which is whatever), and doesn’t seem to be concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "It never feels like she brings them up maliciously, moreso naively/subconsciously and I don’t even think she realizes she’s doing it. But sometimes feels subconsciously like she wants me to be concerned, whether I have a reason to be or not. Like with one of the guys I know and am not concerned about, she talks about him often too and even said he has a nice ass. Again, she’d never date him, and I’m not worried about him, but it feels like she wants me to be? If that makes sense.\n",

I decided to take a work internship MANY states away in order to regroup and figure my life out. Which brings up to the present. I moved back home in February and am due to start school full time again in the fall. My parents and I have a fabulous and very healthy relationship when we don’t see each other everyday.

This adulting was quite new for him and I knew back then that eventually he would feel like it was a lot or he was missing out on his twenties. However, he always assured me that he loved me more than anything and would follow me anywhere.\n",

His new job got him new friends, which Im so happy about and smh I felt like our lives were more balanced (we live in my hometown so I have a lot of friends and family around but he did not). I went for a weekend trip with friends that he knows very well but he could not come due to work on saturday. I let him know about my endeavours as usual, and he went out with his work friends. During the evening, I felt weird - his messages were scarce which is not like him at all.

My little crushes would always go away in a couple weeks naturally, because what I have with bf is so much bigger, stronger, more beautiful and I love him so much. Being slightly attracted to someone else cannot shake that for me.\n",

      "We then spent the entire evening crying, consoling each other. He would say things like 'if we separate for a little while, then we will find each other better'. He misses missing me and I understand that. We also talked about how when he goes out, he feels the need to come home to me early and feels frusrtated. And I was actually mad at this one because we are party people and I never put pressure on him in that regard. He says he does not want me to be alone home but I said im fine with me-time (im a geek too so i usually use the time to play). I feel like he puts a lot of unrealistic expectations on himself, he has this idealistic idea of love and what a couple is so for him getting a crush was shattering. I am from a different background so I am more open to listening and understanding that this things happen, you can't control it but what defines you is how you act on it.\n",

We don't want to rush and yesterday was madly emotional. But I don't know what to do: give him space, accept the break? I feel too anxious and rejected to be initiating much but maybe I should push myself? I am so very lost and every thing he does that is not his usual caring self hurts me deep. He was crying so much yesterday, saying he felt like an asshole and that he loved me still and would see a future with me but that he felt like it was all a lot now (which he never mentioned before).

These compliments are nice in moderation but are quite unrelenting, and I’m missing that deeper physical connection, a sense of intimacy. It feels like I’m more of a cuddle buddy than a boyfriend.

      "Body text: I [29F] have been with my bf [30M] for 7 years, and we're thinking about the future. He comes from a rural part of England and his parents own a farm. We've just moved in together in a city neither of us grew up in, and I've been struggling with the thought of relocating to take over the family farm. Where we live now is closer to his parents farm than to my parents, so it's easier to visit his parents. He visits a lot, and is expected to do a lot of work on the farm, despite his 2 of his brothers living closer and not doing anything on the farm, but he doesn't mind. I do sometimes\n",
      "\n",
      "We have recently talked about the long term future and he's expressed not only his hope but excitement to take his family farm. It's something I was expecting tbh but I don't know if I want to. Maybe I have buried my head in the sand over it, hoping he'd leave that dream behind. I have a degree in a career where there are very few jobs in the county where the farm is, and growing up in the suburbs I'm not accustomed to country living. I am also susceptible to mental health problems and while I have done a lot of work in therapy and have been healthy for the last 2 years, I fear I could slip back into depression if I was isolated. That being said, the farm is only a 10 minute drive from the town, and it's closer to where I grew up than where we're currently living.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all being said, I love to craft and love to garden, and could see myself enjoying this farm life in that regard. And the other hobbies and things I enjoy can be found in the town by the farm. But would I be sacrificing too much, career wise? I could get a job in a sector close to mine and be happy, or get a job similar to what I'm doing now and work from home, but will I always want that? I know I certainly won't be turning into the perfect farm wife, but he's not expecting that from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We almost broke up last year because of his own mental health issues, but we decided we do want to be together. We are best friends, and truly do have so much in common, and I love his family, as he does mine. And I don't particularly want a future without him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the easiest thing to say is to just leave and never look back, especially how normal it is to see a woman sacrifice everything for a man, but I am happy with my life right now where we are, though I know we will have to move to the farm within the next 10 years due to his parents age.\n",

      "Body text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n",
      "\n",
      "T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n",

      "To be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown.

He never sells them, even though he talks about it. A year and a half ago, he won $20,000 at the casino. I thought it would be a huge turning point, but that’s when I found out he had way more credit card debt than he ever disclosed. I was proud that he used the money to pay off the cards and cut them up, and he did set aside money to pay the taxes — but I was also disappointed that it didn’t change anything long-term. There should have been enough to start saving, but here we are now, and I don’t think he has any savings at all.\n",

And while I thought I’d reached a place of independence, the reality is that without him, rent alone would be tough.

But I went into this hopeful that with therapy and some quality time with him, I could start to bring my walls down. It is happening very slowly, but I still feel anxious when I want to express a need, or open up about how I feel. When I get anxious, it dampens my personality. I get quieter and more reserved.\n",

      "He is not much better, probably an avoidant as well. We have lots of things to chat about but when it comes to our relationship its hard to get into it. I feel like there are some conversations that we should have had that haven't happened. Even when we became \"official\" it was because he just started calling me his girlfriend. When I asked him about it, it was because it \"made sense.\" I agreed because to me it made sense too; we have lots in common in terms of interests and values, we're both attracted to each other, live 15 minutes apart, and our families know each other. No reason not to get exclusive and see where this goes, right? \n",

      "We don't see each other more than once or twice a week because of his work schedule (head chef), and I think that contributes to my disconnect from him. Neither of us is big on texting, plus we both work. Last night he came over and I made dinner. We started the fire pit and I wanted to bring up finding ways to spend more time together but my heart was racing. It's not that I expected a bad response from him, I just felt embarrassed about expressing this need, and anxious about potentially diving into this conversation about what our intentions are about this relationship. I really want to plan a weekend with him. We could get an Airbnb somewhere and go hiking and fishing since it's getting warmer out. But he works on the weekend, and they're his peak hours. We usually meet every week on the same day because that's when our availability overlaps. Sometimes we can squeeze in more time another day.\n",

      "The best I could get out was, \"We should plan something.\" Obviously that didn't take me very far. He asked me what I was doing tomorrow and said that he would go in as early as possible to finish work, and he'll let me know. That's what we've been doing, taking it day by day. I don't think I'm in a place to tell him what to do with his time, but sometimes it feels like a lovely slow burn, and other times I don't even know what we're doing. \n",

But we're really not building anything and are unable to plan ahead.

I would greatly appreciate some advice because I really want this to work. \n",

This goes for trips, events, moving, etc. Regardless of what it is, his response is usually that “it always works out, doesn’t it?” And while it’s true that it usually works out ok, it typically causes more stress than necessary, leads to spending more money (late booking, last minute flights, etc) than if he planned a little bit ahead of time. \n",

      "Now most recently, this has started impacting me as we make plans together for travel, moving, and soon to be long distance. It’s really concerning and stressful to me when these things happen, especially when I’m directly impacted. And the thing is, I’m not even a huge planner. I don’t need the details ironed out or to know what we’re doing or eating everyday. Generally, I just want to know that we have a place to stay and a way to get there with a little advance. \n",
      "         For example, we went on a trip and he told me he’d book the hotel. I asked a couple weeks in advance, he says he has it under control. I ask the week of, nothing booked but under control. I ask the night before we’re leaving, still no hotel. He reframes it to say that I don’t “trust him” and when he says he’s “got it” he’s “got it” and I shouldn’t be nagging. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s not just trips and dates, it’s also important things like completing tasks. He had a task to complete, forgot about it because he doesn’t use a calendar or keep track of things in a written way. And because he missed it, he only had one opportunity (which took days out of our time together before he moved across the country) to complete it and had to leave early. I’m getting concerned because it’s a recurring pattern and anytime I bring it up he gets super pissed and it turns into a huge fight. Any advice on how to move forward with this?\n",

      "Body text: Hey everyone, I’m in a situation that’s been weighing heavily on me lately, and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective. I’m 20 years old and have been in a relationship for a year now. It’s my girlfriend’s second relationship, and it’s my first. We’re the same age. There are definitely great aspects to our relationship, and I do see potential — but there are also serious issues that leave me stuck between my future and this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, I used to hit the gym 4–5 times a week, especially during weekend nights with friends — it was an important part of my lifestyle. Since we became a couple, we’ve been spending almost every weekend together from Friday evening to Sunday night, and also a few evenings during the week. While I do enjoy our time together, we mostly just hang out, watch Netflix, go for walks — not really anything productive. The problem is, I also study, have to work, and I have a business project with a friend, and I want to keep up with the gym and start Muay Thai — I have goals I want to pursue while I’m young and have time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I try to talk to her about needing more time for myself and my goals, she takes it personally. She interprets it as me not loving her enough, not making her a priority, or wanting to see her less. She says she also has to study and work but still makes time for me, so I should be able to do the same. She has very high expectations of emotional presence — like wanting her partner to only have eyes for her and treat other women very distantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to emphasize that I’ve tried to communicate this with her — multiple times. I’ve explained that I need time for myself, not just for work or productivity, but because I function better when I have space to recharge and focus on what matters to me. Alone time is important for my well-being, but every time I try to express this, it ends in her feeling hurt or rejected. She takes it as a sign that I don’t care about her enough, rather than understanding that this is something I genuinely need. So while some people might say “just talk it through and find a compromise,” I feel like I’ve already done that — and it hasn’t worked. She sees my needs as a threat rather than something we could balance together.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a deep trust issue. Her last boyfriend betrayed her trust (flirting with other girls, keeping nudes, etc.), and I’ve made mistakes too. Most recently, she found that I had viewed some stupid thirst trap content on TikTok — nothing I saved or interacted with, just watched. But it triggered a big fight, and I fully understand why. I apologized, deleted TikTok, and acknowledged it as a moment of weakness and lack of dicipline I'm working on. But it really hurt her and worsened the trust issues that were already there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also gets upset over things that seem harmless to me. For example, one time I bought flowers for my mother’s birthday, and before heading into the gym, I asked a female staff member at the gym front desk (she was the only person there) if she could hold them for me during my workout, since they’d get damaged in my locker. My girlfriend was with me at the time, and afterwards, she was really upset — saying I was too nice to the staff member and that a “real man” shouldn’t speak so kindly to other women. From my perspective, it was just a practical and polite interaction — nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not even saying I need to be friends with other girls — that’s not what I’m after. I don’t feel the need for female friends. But at the very least, just being able to communicate normally, socialize, and maybe build connections if there is any value or so like a normal person — simply because it’s always valuable to know people and improve your social skills — is already a huge issue for her. In her eyes, like I mentioned, a man shouldn’t even be kind to another woman. To her, things like simply talking to other women or being friendly already feel like a form of cheating — because in her eyes, a truly loyal man only has eyes for her, ignores other girls completely, and would never initiate any kind of interaction with them, as that would already cross a boundary of trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often questions whether I’m really out with my friends and asks me to send proof. It’s exhausting. And while I’ve made my mistakes and try to take accountability, the trust issues have been there from the start and seem to be growing, not healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, I feel stuck between two paths. Part of me wants to hold on and try to fix things. But the other part wonders if I’m already giving up too much of myself just to maintain this relationship — and whether that’s something I’ll regret later. I’m trying to figure out what’s truly right for me long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I’m 20 and in a one-year relationship with someone I care about, but I’m stuck between growing as a person and keeping the relationship going. I’ve already communicated that I need time and space to focus on studying, the gym, and building a self-employment project — but my girlfriend takes that as rejection. Trust issues, emotional pressure, and control are wearing me down. I’m unsure whether to keep pushing or choose myself.\n",

I saw his bank account statement when we were uploading them to the gov website for reassessment, and asked about one of the transactions that was weird.

      "Body text: \n",
      "I'm a 22 year old male that been hyper sexual for as long as I can remember. I grew up in a rough and abusive household and was also exposed to sex very early by seeing guys hook up with my then single mother around the age I was 4-5. I discovered masturbating in the third grade, and porn in 6th. I haven't stopped either since I've found it. Having grown up in a rather conservative household sex/masturbating was always a taboo, and I was only shamed for it never taught how to approach it in a healthy manner. Fast forward to college, and I began chatting constantly with girls online hoping to send and receive nudes as much as I can. I would pull all nighters doing this. Couple years into college, I met a wonderful girl (24) who loves me dearly. Fortunately for her, she grew up healthy and is not nearly as sex driven as me. Unfortunately that caused a lot of rifts in our sex life and I would go through multiple periods of almost resenting her because I felt she wasn't allowing me to be the terrible person I wanted to be (for some reason I wouldn't just break up with her, whether I was too much of a coward or just did rly love her too much). To backtrack a bit the first couple months of our relationship I stayed loyal and didn't do anything. After those months I once got back to chatting with girls online, except this time being more sneaky using pics of other people, using niche sites/apps etc, to satisfy my urges. Occasionally (2x that I can remember) I slipped up and sent a real pic of after intially showing the girl a pic of someone else. Both times the woman took a screenshot of the pic. This gives me terrible anxiety as I'm so scared one day somehow the person will recognize me and tell my gf. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time this led me to dive even further into my addictions, where even if I wasn't chatting with girls online I was \"gooning\" to porn on twitter. This continued my spiral even further, I began getting brainwashed by porn. Brainwashed enough that though I seemingly had no attraction to men, and still don't, I was fascinated with penis's and jerking together to porn with other men. This intially started with Omegle like web chats but eventually made its way all the way down to getting Grindr and jerking  with 2 separate guys while drunk. Those Grindr interactions happened with the same month, and to this day I don't understand what came over me to think that was okay. I didn't even enjoy it, it just left me yearning for more satisfaction through porn. Over the last 3-4 years I have on and off done this, last year I deleted many of my accounts and got better, but then I again released a few months ago and got back into porn. Recently I guess my frontal lobe finally developed because I've felt sick to my stomach about all the secrets I've been keeping and have deleted pretty much all my porn accounts. I love my gf and if you ask her she'd say I've been amazing to her. I plan on marrying her. For years my porn fueled brain justified my actions stating that as long as I'm good to her it was all good. Now i feel so incredibly guilty that it's all I think about. I can't possibly tell her, she would never look at me the same. If I do truly stop with all this, is it right for me to go on with my life (hope I never get exposed) and marry her? Or should I break up with her and seemingly give her no real explanation as to why. I don't know, I'm lost. I feel as if I've ruined my young life with these perversions as I'll always be worried that someone will recognize me and expose me. It's exhausting to live like this. I understand I probably sound like a terrible person, and I probably am. I wish I didn't have the childhood I had, and I wish I was a better man. I would appreciate it if I didn't get bashed and recieved some helpful or ig reassuring remarks, but I understand if not. \n",

He also now takes a much longer time to reply, and I have been the only reason we even have days to hang out. I feel like I am losing him, but not sure if it's something to wait out.

All her attention was towards him, i was upset and my mood has dropped, I stopped enjoying the party. She was asking if Im okay, told her yea. Then I confronted her about it, when we left to the hotel. I was like \"im overreacting\", so I asked her: \"Allright, how would you feel if I did the same to you?\" Her response: \"I would take it worse and probably fight with that friend.\" \n",

      "Title: I’ve been in a relationship for 6 months now. My girlfriend (22F) recently decided to wait until marriage. Need advice on what to do next\n",
      "Body text: Throwaway account, let’s try this again\n",
      "\n",
      "TL/DR: Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 6 months now. We’ve been away from each other for some time now. During this time away she has decided suddenly she wants to wait until marriage for sex. I want to stay with her, but I need advice on how to make this change more manageable for me or if it’s realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, I was aware she was a virgin (and hasn’t been in a relationship before) and she was aware that I have had multiple sexual experiences prior to her. Since it was her first, I was willing to take things extremely slow since I didn’t want to rush her into anything she wasn’t ready for. She also comes from a religious background and because of that has had the ideology installed in her that she should never have pre marital sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, we did have it, and over the course of the next 4-5 months we had it a lot. The first time we did I was hesitant because I didn’t feel comfortable as it wasn’t just a religious choice but a personal choice that she made, but shortly after we got together she went back on her word she made to her self and decided herself that she wanted to engage in it. Note that at that point, I was fully confident in myself that I would be able to wait until marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she recently left for a trip overseas back to her home country. This is where she grew up until 2 years ago. She went back to her family in a religious area and she’s been there for the past month and a half. I was afraid this shift back to what she knew might change the relationship, but I didn’t know to what extent\n",
      "\n",
      "2 things happened while she was gone… 1) We broke up for a short bit, after she voiced her concerns that I haven’t been emotionally available to her. She felt that we should take a break and remain as friends to strengthen our bond and eventually get together, however she was also clear that she still wanted a relationship with me. After some space from talking together and a lot of conversation we voiced our concerns and got back together, and I promised to do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the most recent thing… She mentioned she had something she wanted to talk about when she was back from her trip, but after asking to talk about it now, she told me she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex again. In the moment, because I love her and was willing to before we had it, I told her I was ok with that. However I very quickly realized that this is a huge decision to make on both of our parts and I didn’t want to tell her something if I can promise it. So the following day, I had another conversation with her and she explained further.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that she felt guilty and viewed sex as something sacred to her. She also said sometimes after a while of us having sex it lost value to her since it didn’t feel “sacred” to her as much. She made it clear that she wants to feel that we’re making love, not just doing the action. She said that she wouldn’t mind reducing the sex to special occasions, but she preferred if we stopped all together and waited until marriage. It’s important to note that she would be the one who usually asks me for sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where I’m at now. I’m conflicted, I don’t want to commit to something I can’t promise her, however i did see a future with her as she is the one I want to marry. Now however, I’m unsure about the constant changes she’s making to our relationship while being away, unsure about if I’m able to wait as we already had it once, and unsure if I should stick it through or leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also can’t shake the feeling that these changes and difficulties in our relationship when we haven’t been together may be causing some doubts in her mind, because as a person I realized she functions off of positive reinforcement and time spent together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men and women, I need advice from both sides on how to make this change more manageable for myself and if it’s realistic to wait possibly years after already engaging in the act.\n",

      "Title: My husband has changed so much since he became \"stable\". I can't tell if he even likes me anymore. Advice?\n",
      "Body text: Hello, I (23F) have been married to my husband (28M) for less than a year now, together for over 3 years now. I'll go ahead and say sorry bc this post will probably be all over the place, but I just need to get this out somewhere. I also apologize about formatting, I'm writing this on mobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some back story, my husband and I both have struggled with mental health, with us both being medicated. My husband has had a longer journey with getting properly medicated, and was not fully \"stable\" until about 1 year ago (Ie. Able to hold down a job/not having drastic mood swings).\n",
      "\n",
      " During the first 2 years of our relationship, we both got along pretty well, as we had a lot of the same interests and just tried to make each other happy. During this time, we both were supporting each other through mental health struggles ( I have anxiety/depression/ADHD, and he has anxiety/ADHD as well as a mood disorder). About a year ago, he hit a very low point and we agreed that it would be best for him to be admitted to an in patient facility. While it was awful at the time, the facility was able to get him properly medicated and he has not had to get a med change since then, with no highs/lows like before which is awesome! \n",
      "\n",
      "However, after the medicine change I noticed a shift in his overall demeanor. He was still himself, but his patience was lower, he was quicker to get annoyed, and he was more condescending. I've brought this up to him several times, but he says that he's always had anger issues, but his previous medications dulled his moods and his cognition. He said he feels better and smarter now, and that being grumpy is just \"part of who he is\". \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I've always been more silly/goofy, and will just ask questions about nonsense stuff just for the sake of talking with my husband and having fun. Before, he used to join in and we'd just be goof balls together, talking for hours on this and that, having fun. During the last year or so, I've noticed that when I try to do the same thing, he just looks at me like I'm dumb or scoffs at me like I'm a child who genuinely doesn't know better about something. I've stopped engaging in random conversations like that with him as often, but he gets annoyed at that too, saying I don't talk with him enough and that I don't spend enough time with him. But when I try to be myself, it absolutely feels like he's looking down on me or that he just thinks I'm dumb or something, when I'm just trying to be silly and have fun with the person I love. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to state for the record, he is also still goofy when HE'S in the mood to be, he loves meme culture, he likes to act goofy when he's in a good mood, and he likes to make up songs about stuff, dance around, or poke fun at himself or me. I don't really know how to describe it honestly; it's like if HE wants to be fun and silly, then it's fine, but if he's not in that mood and I act the same way, then it's because I'm dumber than him, not because I'm doing it on purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big issue is how he speaks to me during arguments. He admits that when he \"feels threatened\" (when I point out things he's doing that make me upset) he feels cornered and goes extreme because he wants to \"win\" the argument. I've talked with him about several issues with this:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. \"Winning\" is not the goal when you're having a problem in marriage, we're both supposed to be trying to solve issues together. He says he agrees with that statement, but whenever he discussed arguments from the past, he always has to point out if he \"won\" or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. He says hurtful/extreme things during arguments, but once everything is calmed down he backtracks, says he only said those things bc he was upset and that I shouldn't take it to hear. For example, he has told me that our entire marriage has been unhappy, that I don't care about him like he does me, that he's miserable around me, that he's relieved when he gets to go to work to \"be away from me\", and several times he's made comments along the lines of \"you have (xyz) because of ME, I'M the reason you have (gym membership/different bed/etc) and yet you treat me LIKE THIS\". He has also brought up divorce several times, stating if I don't \"change the way I behave, then this is going to end in divorce\".\n",
      "\n",
      " I try my best to hear out his side of things, listen to what he's been hurt by or feels unhappy with and make changes for him. And once the argument is over, and he's had a few hours to calm down, it's like a switch flips and he loves me so much, I'm the best wife ever, he doesn't know what he'd do without me, he's never going anywhere and he'll always be with me, etc etc. and then things will be good for a few weeks/a month, and then the next time we have tension it starts all over again. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably my biggest issue as of right now, because the going back and forth from 2 extremes; from him saying he feels \"miserable\" and that our marriage is unhappy/ruined, to turning around 2 hours later saying I'm the best thing that ever happen to him or he loves me more than anything, and he hates fighting and just wants to be happy together. I don't know how to handle it, and it makes me feel like I have to hold him at arms length, and I hate it. I feel so confused about how he actually feels about me, and it's starting to make me feel disconnected from him and the marriage \n",
      "\n",
      "For the record, we are both currently in therapy, and he is talking with him therapist about dealing with angry issues, and I'm working on communication skills and executive functioning, bc I am most certainly not perfect, and I have things I need to work on too. But I just don't know what to do as of right now. I don't feel like I can talk with him about his mood shifts, because he takes it as me saying it's his fault he has a mood disorder, and \"I knew what I was signing up for when I married him\". I've told him that while it's not his fault that he has angry issues/ mood shifts, the things he says and does when he's angry/upset are still his responsibility. It just makes him feel more upset, and he continues to say I'm blaming him for symptoms of a disability, when that's not my intent. All I want is for him to think about the things he says to me before he says them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel so selfish, but I miss the person he was when we started dating. I hate that I feel that way, because he's stable now and can hold a job and can keep routines, and he says he feels better and, for the most part, I can tell he does. I don't wish any of pain and anxiety he went through during low points in those first 2 years onto him, I just miss how much more joy he seemed to take in everyday things like taking a walk together, playing video games together for hours, exploring woods together, or staying up late baking cakes and making puzzles together. i miss that gentleness, I miss the kind person I knew. He says that he's more himself now, and for some reason that makes me sad, and I feel so incredible selfish for it. \n",

      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I feel like my husband has changed from the man I knew after he became \"stable\" with new medication, to the point that it feels like he doesn't even like me and I don't feel secure in the relationship. How do I deal with these feelings? How do I approach this with him?\n",

I can count on one hand the amount of times he has complimented me in our relationship. The most I have gotten is “you look nice” or “you look pretty”. Words of affirmation is my love language and I have communicated that since day 1. I have had a  two talks about this but nothing changes. I don’t mean to sound conceited but I am an extremely attractive woman and have been told that my entire life. I get compliments from strangers more than my own boyfriend.  I want to feel desired by him. He does show it in other ways like physical touch but as I said, words of affirmations is one of my main love languages. I know this was a problem in his past relationship - she lacked reassurance and compliments. Our relationship is seriously almost perfect in every other aspect so I’m not sure what to do.  I think deep down my gut knows that I won’t be fulfilled long term but is there any other advice you could give me? Or possible reasons why he seems to be incapable of complimenting me.\n",

      "\n",
      "So the story begins with his friend (35M). He's the type of friend that everyone has: shitty, but not quite enough to cut him off completely. He's just nice enough to keep around, but shitty enough to make you uncomfortable. And my bf's biggest fault is him being a people pleaser. Anyway, a few weeks ago they went out for a drink together. The problem is that he didn't tell my bf that he will be bringing his new gf too (and mind you he didn't say anything about inviting me too even though my bf said he can't stay for too long cause he needs to pick me up from work). Long story short, he came home tipsy (but not blackout drunk) and told me that his friend and his gf tried to set him up with one of the gf's friends that ended up coming over too. He quickly shut it down and brought up the fact that he has a gf, to the disappointment of his friend. Obviously I wasn't happy at all, 1. Why tf would they set him up with someone knowing full well he's in a happy relationship? 2. I brought up him staying longer and drinking more even after knowing their real intention, and letting himself be in that situation. He completely understands, apologised, and we moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the problem is: he might be working on a project that lets him be in closer contact with this friend, while I don't mind them keeping in touch with each other, I know for a fact when it comes to them going out for drinks again, I won't feel comfortable about it at all. I don't want to lose trust in him, but I truly don't think I can trust this friend of him, and eventually in my bf too if he kept putting himself in these situations. Now, obviously this hasn't happened yet, but I know it will soon cause they tend to catch up once in a while.\n",

      "My question is am i crazy for thinking this way? I NEVER want to tell him to cut someone off, or who to be friends with.

I feel burnt out with life and I (27F) have self-sabotaged my first-ever loving relationship with my boyfriend (30M). For backstory, we met and dated during the pandemic. I was a non-traditional community college student about to transfer and he was a military sergeant who was thinking of pursuing college for the first time in order to become an officer. We fell in love and with some encouragement he applied to community college and I transferred. We lived 10 min from each other for a year and then 30 min from each other for 2 years. Although there are many precious memories, our arguments have reached a limit to him and I’m afraid there’s no turning back as much as I’m trying to fix it.\n",

I saw the potential in him and encouraged him to apply to the local private university that is known as one of the best in the country. He was hesitant yet he applied 2 weeks prior to the deadline. When he got accepted to the private university, I cried tears of joy. I was so very proud of him! However, I didn’t expect him to be loaded in work. Now he had military officer training (rotc), 20 units per quarter in order to graduate within 2 years, and tons of reading and essays. Meanwhile, I was finishing my last year of public university with school-related stress and severe imposter syndrome because I had tried for 3 years to obtain a major-related internship and failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I graduated in May 2024, my imposter syndrome got worse because I obtained a seasonal position I didn’t really want. Then, I was coming to a realization that my boyfriend’s college career was working out so well for him. This is when I first started feeling a bit jealous of my boyfriend. In the past year, he got accepted as an officer which means that will be his title/ranking in the military once he’s active after his graduation. This meant a year away from home to train and I was ok with that. I started planning out goals to achieve during our year away from each other so when I move in with him, I can be financially and mentally independent. But nothing in my life has worked out how I wanted it to.\n",

      "\n",
      "• I only worked for 2 months as a seasonal employee. My job search has led to a few interviews. I’ve been forced to accept job rejections and ghosting. I have tailored my resume multiple times with chatgpt and wrote cover letters for the positions I was really interested in. \n",

      "• A month ago, my 15 yo childhood dog started suffering epilepsy and had to be put down. Seeing my dog have a 10 min seizure was extremely traumatic. \n",

      "• 2 months ago, my homeless uncle, aunt, and aunt’s husband moved into our home. A family of 4 is now 7 in a 3 bed/2 bath home. We’re all adults and I gave up my room so my aunt and her husband could sleep in it. To say I’m overwhelmed is an understatement. I have no privacy and my aunt is a highly opinionated woman and having to hear her voice everyday annoys me because I disagree with lots of things she says yet I have to remain composed and apathetic because I don’t want to make her feel disrespected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve only hung out with my boyfriend for 2-3 weekends this year and the last 2 weekends were messy and unhealthy that I don’t really remember most of the arguments. The first weekend I recall feeling sad because he was not giving me enough attention but that was the norm because he was always busy with school. What triggered me was seeing a matching bracelet I gave him. I had mine on but his was on a shelf and that killed me emotionally. I didn’t say anything and went into his apartment bathroom to cry on the floor. After an hour of crying, I kept thinking to myself “Why isn’t he coming for me? Why am I torturing myself?”. I had enough and went into the small living room and cried. I was still ignored for hours. After about 3 hours of just crying on the floor, I started hitting myself and saying things like “you don’t love me”. I ripped the matching bracelet off of me. He obviously reacted but didn’t hug me. He told me to relax and we talked while I cried and then I told him to hug me. He told me to play a game on my iPad and then we went to bed cuddling and had sex. The next day it was as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second weekend we hung out, I didn’t feel like cooking with him which is usually what we do. I felt tired of my life and was only thinking of jobs and career future. I do remember opening up about being so worried that my plans weren’t working out and how traumatic this job search has been. I felt like not owning a car and having all my savings decrease overtime made me feel like a worthless girlfriend. What do I have to offer when we move in together? The next day, I don’t remember what he said but I started packing up my stuff crying. I told him I wasn’t feeling good and that it would be best if I leave. We then sat down and he started getting a bit upset that in the past 2 years I always run away during an argument or over something he says. He had told me he was walking on egg shells and I told him the same. I was running away but letting him know for the first time ever which was kind of hard to do. Looking back, it’s a bit of growth to even be a bit open in communication instead of being silently dramatic when running away. I didn’t leave and the next day we went on a beautiful hike and had lunch. This was 5 weeks ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming back home, I realized that I’m not ok. I felt on the verge of burnout. My self-esteem was at its lowest and I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. Nothing brings me joy. I decided to seek therapy because I was done feeling overwhelmed with life. I was jealous of my boyfriend’s life and tired of not being able to regulate my emotions. I knew this was depression. Eventually, I broke down at home because I was rejected from the 2 positions I had interviewed at. I wasted an entire month just interviewing with those companies and carrying false hope. Breaking down for me is ugly. So much self-loathing sentiments and the urge to simply die but being unable to. A huge wave of negative thoughts I’ve been telling myself about everything including my relationship overtook me and I blew it later that night (Mother’s Day weekend). He FaceTimes me and in the recent months, our conversations have been about his upcoming graduation. With attitude, I let him know that it’s best if he gives away my graduation ticket to someone else in his family because they will enjoy and celebrate him more than I ever will. He asked “What did you say?” And I said “You know what I said”. He sternly smiled and said ok. We hung up and I went to sleep with deep shame. I had my first therapy session the next day and the connection wasn’t there which was frustrating. I realized I regretted hurting my boyfriend and that what I truly needed was a psychiatrist. I meet her this Wednesday. Anyways, my boyfriend still texted me and I kindly said I wasn’t feeling well and that I would text him another day. He told me that was ok and to feel better. It took me 4 days to calm down and during those 4 days I finally opened up to my mom about what was going on with me. I cried because I had negative 10 dollars in my bank account all because my ego didn’t allow me to work a regular retail/fast food job. I felt a bit better once I made my psych appointment because I wanted to change for the better. I’m tired of hurting the people that love me the most. After 4 days, I texted him what was up and he ignored me. After a few messages he tells me he had the roughest weekend ever, that I wouldn’t understand and wants to be alone and just focus on finishing strong in order to graduate. I said I was here now and to talk to me and he refused. I called him 8 times until he picked up with attitude. I told him this is clearly a relationship issue and it’s an urgent matter that needs to be fixed. He basically said he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I cause a lot of stress and pain for him and the resentment had been building up overtime which led him not trusting me anymore. I knew all of our problems that I instigated were part of his decision but clearly the graduation ticket comment was the breaking point. I cried so much and had another mental breakdown. I opened up to my mom about all the times I’ve been so mean and spiteful to him and how he didn’t deserve any of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a few days he accepted a phone call where I apologized and let him know I was already trying to seek help and I wanted him to give us another chance. He said no as it didn’t matter anymore since he’s leaving for a year. I cried again for almost a week and I felt I was going crazy. The psych ward couldn’t have me as I didn’t have plans to you know what. I was referred to a crisis counselor that didn’t help at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then chose to drive to him since I hadn’t seen him in 5 weeks. I left a care package of food and snacks that I paid with a credit card. He kindly accepted it and took me for a walk to talk. We catched up as if nothing had ever happened. Then we started talking about the care package. He said he felt so bad that I wasn’t coping well and had driven 2 hrs to see him. He wanted to give me money and I refused. He told me “you know you’re struggling”. That hurt me to the max and I apologized again about the graduation comments and anything I ever said or did. He said the resentment was there but that all was forgiven. He said he couldn’t take me back if I didn’t love myself. He said “How can you love someone else if you don’t love yourself?”. He had watery eyes throughout our conversation but I just ugly cried. I told him I was already making a huge step to fixing myself and he said no. He said he asked many times for me to change and he never saw it. He doesn’t believe I will change and my heart shattered. I had self-sabotaged my relationship. We hugged one last time and he didn’t want to kiss me so I don’t get false hope of reconciliation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how I drove back home but I haven’t eaten in 2 days and my family doesn’t understand me at all. They just want me to accept and feel better. I have to hear them talk about how disrespectful I am that I’m not eating or doing anything. I’m officially burnt out and want my own space to mourn. I keep beating myself up even though he told me not to. He told me he cares a lot about me and still loves me and I lowkey feel betrayed because he has never left before when I’m out of my mind. His graduation week includes officer training graduation, his birthday, and our 4 year anniversary as well. All hopes and dreams are lost because of me and I truly regret hurting him. Why couldn’t I support him when he loved me? Does anyone have stories about reconciliation? Any advice? Thank you for reading. I’m lost and I’m very sorry this is all about me. I hope to be better.   \n",

      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I’ve been deeply depressed and overwhelmed with life. I pushed away the person I love the most and now he says he can’t be with me anymore. He still cares, but says I need to focus and love myself first. I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist soon but he says he doesn’t want to pursue the relationship anymore. Is there any hope for reconciliation? How do I move forward when I feel like I destroyed everything?\n",

      "Body text: We’ve been official for about 4 months now. I love her and she genuinely seems deeply in love with me when we are together and we get along very well. We usually spend our weekends together so I see her fairly often. But when we text, she is pretty slow to reply or inconsistent at best, doesn’t really update me often until after the fact or when she sees she has left me unanswered for a while, and doesn’t engage in meaningful conversation even though I try to. She usually isn’t too busy in the evenings but doesn’t usually make much effort to talk to me much at night from what it seems. Ive brought it up and she says she’s usually busy reading or cooking or that she’ll get better at it (she’s used to being single and not talking to someone often). Im not so much worried something is going on as I am slightly annoyed at our discourse at this point. I’d be much more receptive to late replies if we actually were talking about something beyond what we are doing at that exact moment. I feel like I’m constantly making cute advances to get her attention or trying to just have a nice conversation with my girlfriend just to get a “thank you my love”, a short almost flippant seeming reply, or a text back that has nothing to do with what I said before it pertaining to her or something shes doing.

      "My girlfriend and I reconnected in fall 2020 after having been just acquaintances (if even that) in high school a few years prior. Everything was going just incredible … we clicked on every level and our honeymoon period lasted literally years. She’s my first girlfriend while she’s been in a few relationships before.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have some similar interests, find a lot of the same things funny, and really enjoyed each other’s company for years. Prior to all of this I would’ve said she’s a *very* sweet, kind, and gentle person, truly. I thought and think of myself as a pretty nice guy too lol although perhaps not to her level.\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved into a small apartment together summer of 2024 and almost immediately, things got kind of bad, to put it plainly. I knew she was far and away not the tidiest person in the world (extremely hygienic (self-hygiene) but also extremely untidy in terms of keeping the apartment clear and tidy) but didn’t expect it to be so awful. To put it simply, we had an abject mess (I called it a pigsty, honestly) in our small apartment for over six months. And I really mean like shit *all* over the floor to the point where it was a mini hoarder’s home and you had to deliberately find small clear paths to walk through. It was like a goddamn minefield LOL. Maybe an actual minefield would’ve even been preferable for my sanity! It was a mix of her stuff and mine, but really mostly her stuff. I seriously cannot overemphasize how gross it was—not like food and crap out, but just everything that would have been stowed in a normal person’s home was out and about in ours. I understand sometimes it takes time to clear your stuff out, especially for people having moved out for the first time and especially in a small home, but come on, man. I also understand some homes can be “lived in,” but this also was just anything but that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bothered me *immensely*. Immensely is a huge understatement, really. I’ve never suspected I had OCD or anything like that and really still don’t—I’m just a guy who likes a tidy home. I don’t need every single speck of dust and every single, I don’t know, tiny little thing to be away, but 99% of your shit just has to be away, I feel. At the very least, you need enough goddamn floor space to be able to move around freely!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even knowing just how much it disgusted and bothered me, she did almost nothing. She would tell me she’s doing it little by little but I’m sorry, if that were really the case then after six months (a little more, actually) I would’ve at the very least seen a dent put in the mess, but I didn’t. And yes, of course I offered to help, especially after seeing she just wasn’t doing it. I don’t understand how anyone could live in conditions like that. I didn’t have family or friends or anyone over just because I was horrified by the mess and knew they would be too. Again, there seemed to be close to zero effort put into clearing it on her end.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, I decided enough was enough and, entirely by myself (just saying lol), I cleared the entire apartment’s worth of crap in two days. It took me an entire working day to clear out all the crap in the living room and kitchen, and then an entire working day to clear out the bedroom too. Let me again emphasize that it wasn’t entirely her stuff—there was some of mine mixed in too, especially in the bedroom. I’m not going to put 100% of the blame on her because that’s just not right. After I cleared it, everything was spotless, and I mean spotless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, she asked (kind of demanded, really, but I’ve done the same with a few things too) to be able to put her work bags and stuff on a section of the floor adjacent to our couch because she “needed it for easy access.” Okay, whatever. Not optimal but that’s a compromise I’m very willing to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has crescendoed to: our kitchen table is packed with mail (90% hers—again, I am to blame here too), our living room has a large floor section inaccessible to do her having taken out her I believe summer clothes but “not having found time” to put them away, her side of the bedroom (adjacent to her bed) is overflowing with random crap, and even the little adjacent-to-the-couch section of her bags is untidy too. Maybe this all sounds stupid and insignificant to you, but Jesus Christ it bothers the absolute *fuck* out of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is incredible with cleaning the bathroom and all the chores she has to do (we split pretty much evenly), but the tidiness is just … I have no words. She has told me she does not regard clearing up the apartment as a chore! She prioritizes even going to the gym or a bike ride over that. I do not understand it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of moving in itself was awful as well. My parents had spent a very considerable amount of time rearranging the apartment after my grandpa passed and trying to keep the best furniture. I understand that it was our first time moving out and that it was exciting and this and that and we have big ideas for the apartment and we’re going to buy $5,000 of new furniture, and hoopah and hakkah and yadda yadda yadda. That is all well and good, but we went about this in a ridiculous way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like when you move into a new place, you try to put all your stuff away and see how everything turns out. Of course, if some furniture is old or ugly or whatever, it’s gotta go. However, her approach which I could not compromise her out of was getting rid of furniture while not replacing all of it. Why is this a huge problem? The apartment is, again, small and quite limited in space, and what do you know, to this day we still have big space issues! Why the hell would you get rid of furniture BEFORE you’ve even finished moving in; before even evaluating how much space you truly end up with?!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the goddamn TVs lol. I’ll try to keep this one short: they are entirely too high and I didn’t get much of a say. Instead of simply putting the living room TV on a stand, we wall mounted it. She said it’s because “people trip over them” and it happened to her sisters in their youth. Okay, not a big deal. Well the day her dad and sister came over to install our two TVs, it was basically a 3 versus 1 … I pleaded my case that they were too high while her and her dad were quite pushy and we ended up with TVs mounted insanely high lol. Like it hurts my neck to watch! Doesn’t sound like a big deal, but my opinion wasn’t really heard and now that we agreed to compromise and lower them, her idea of “compromise” here is to, in her words, lower it by an inch or so. Okay. Lol. “Compromise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat is also an issue. She was my grandpa’s before he passed and is a total sweetheart. My girlfriend knew that a prerequisite of us moving in was taking the cat with us as my cat at home (also a sweetheart but a diva as well lol) does not tolerate any other cats. Grandpa’s cat had to come with us. Grandpa’s cat has long fur and it gets everywhere—it’s just how it is. It’s not great. She’s also a little overweight (vet and I have been working on it) and oozes a gross reddish-brown fluid from around her anus, and it gets on the bed. Again, very much less than optimal!\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend tolerates the cat but *hates* cleaning up the fur and the stains we get on the bed. I don’t like it either! But it is what it is. Her solution to this is a proposal to not let the cat in the bedroom at all. This, quite frankly, is a total nonstarter for me as the cat is an indoor cat and cutting her access to the bedroom means she has something like 33% less space (or thereabouts) to roam and live, not to mention the fact she wouldn’t be able to cuddle us at night the way she likes. That proposal sounds borderline cruel to me. We didn’t really come to an agreement so she’s taken to simply shutting the door after I leave for work, meaning from 9  to 5 PM the cat is locked out of the bedroom anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also doesn’t feed the cat nor clean the litter box. Again, she knew that the cat was coming with us. Anyway, with the litter box: cool, whatever. Can’t say I enjoy shoveling cat poo every morning but I’ll do it. Feeding a cat however is far less gross and takes, what, maybe a minute max? And that’s if you’re slow! How long does it really take to get a new bowl, get a can of cat food, open the can, and put it in a bowl? I’d say about a minute lol. But she doesn’t do that out of principle! Seriously, like I will be at work or just not at home and the cat will be hungry and she just … won’t feed it out of principle. It really pisses me off. I’ve of course asked why and every time the answer has been, “u/bcyankees, I just don’t want to take on another responsibility!” Let me again remind you that this would be a one-minute “responsibility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, due to the constant fighting, we’ve really just lost mutual respect for one another. I don’t know better to state that, truly. It is just the frank truth. In fact, during an argument a few months ago, she told me verbatim that she “doesn’t respect me anymore.” That, by the way, sounds like something you’d only say to your partner if you were trying to hurt them. I’ve never said anything objectionable to her apart from snide comments during arguments (obviously not cool or right, I know) and once calling her lazy for not clearing up her shit. She has called me a D-word multiple times during arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve really had enough of all this horseshit all this time and finally summoned up the courage (if that sounds odd, it’ll make sense in just a moment) to address these concerns with her after three weeks of putting this conversation off. The reason I was putting it off is because I just knew exactly how it was gonna go, and boy was I right, quite unfortunately …\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing up the mutual disrespect first, we both acknowledged it was bad. Her solution is couple’s therapy (which she’s brought up multiple times over the months) but that is honestly a nonstarter for me. When I then said that I was just fed up with the current state of the apartment and earnestly pleaded her to address it, at least a little (and I’ve done so about a million times over since moving in, sometimes quite nicely, sometimes abrasively, honestly), I was met with the reaction I expected. **NO, NO, NO!**Well, basically that. She absolutely shut me the fuck down and invalidated my concerns, telling me she wasn’t going to sit there and have me complain about her when I had initially framed it as a conversation we needed to have. Instantly, shut down. Instantly. She’s been hearing this for months but it really came to a boil here. In fact, I’ve been *very* cautious about bringing up her untidiness to her lately as it upsets her acutely and immediately. Her rule is I am not allowed to voice my concerns in the morning or in the evening (yes, seriously), so this limits me to only the weekends lol. And even then, like I’ve said, I haven’t told her a damn thing in probably close to a month because she gets pissed any time I bring up even a small thing that needs to be put away!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that’s kind of it. Immediately shut down, and I just took it like a B. I didn’t even stand up for myself—I’m just so defeated after all this time lol. What was a spectacularly perfect relationship became … this … in the span of less than six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, wtf do I do? What do you do? Couple’s therapy? Learn to talk to each other a little better? Try to compromise some more? Go our separate ways? I honestly don’t see myself proposing to her at this point and I don’t know what kind of future we could have together.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have of course only seen my side of all this. Maybe I’m just a total A-hole and completely in the wrong here—it’s possible. Please advise me as to what the actual fuck I can do with this awful, awful, nightmarish situation.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. I've definitely struggled over the years managing my emotional and mental health. I've been doing really well the last couple of years since I'm medicated and see my therapist every week. I've held a job for about 6 years now, my longest ever. I'm really proud of myself. He's really proud of me too. He's the only person I've been with that has ever felt like they understand what I'm going through.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and is on medication for that, but it doesn't seem to be helping. I think part of that is the system failing him, but I don't know how much of it is just him. He had lost his job a few months after I met him. I offered to have him move in with me so he wasn't homeless. He's not on good terms with his family, so he didn't really have anywhere else to go. In the three years we've been together he's had 3 jobs. None of them have lasted more than a month. He works for a while, then he gets super panicky and his anxiety his the roof and he completely breaks down. Personally I don't care if he makes money or not, I just want him to get better. He says he feels worthless all the time because he doesn't do anything. I mean he takes care of things around the house and is really good emotional support for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's tried a couple medication changes with his doctor and has seen a psychiatrist like 3 times. He tells me that it doesn't feel like they want to help him. I've tried to suggest therapists and even suggested getting married so he could have better medical insurance. In my experience, it feels like he definitely has some trauma and probably also has ADHD (birds of a feather). I always feel like he doesn't want to take my advice to help get him through the medical system to get him better. I mean I get it. It's difficult to find a good therapist and a good doctor.\n",

      "I have been in a realtionship with my bf for almost a year and we have been through some difficulties. I have always expressed my feelings to him if I don’t like something that he does or if he doesn’t think about me doing things, for example, being on his phone while we are together, even though we met 2 times a week as we live in different cities and our job schedules didn’t allow us to meet more often and other small things that have accumulated over the months. I always explain my feelings very detailed, so that he could understand where I’m coming from, even thinking of examples to help him understand me more clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "One time I told him that I don’t like that he follows random girls on instagram, all I asked for was that he unfollows them, but he didn’t do it right away, he did it only when I was feeling down, because of it and ignoring his texts, then he did it. Mind you, he unfollowed 200 accounts that were just girls. After 6 months into the relationship, I went through his phone (I know that it’s wrong on my part too, but I guess I have bad experience from my last relationship, so I just wanted to make sure everything is okay), and I found that he had old messages in insta dm, random girls in snapchat (again a lot of them) and screenshots of models accounts (y’know which ones). Basically we had a long conversation about this, he confessed that all those times that I was expressing my hurt feelings he just said that he understood and he wouldn’t do that again, but everything was repeating, but now he really understood, he had a talk with his mom, I guess at least she could explain to him that relationship is work and you have to try. In the end I forgave him even though I didn’t forget. About dm’s he said that he just doesn’t clean history, altogether his phone. About screenshots he said that he just discussed them (not in a positive way) with his colleague and forgot to delete them. He doesn’t really use snap, so again, just never cleaned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all this, our relationship wasn’t really back in its tracks, only because I was often feeling hurt and not respected, so there were times when I would kind of remind him of everything and then he would get upset that I would even remind him that, why I can’t just forget it, but I really can’t, I don’t understand him and why he did what he did while being in a realtionship, but after all that, he said that he cleaned his phone and I moved on, even though I was still hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week later I sent him a big text with my feelings about all of this and what has happened before and we had a small talk, I know that he understands how hurt I am and how not respected I felt. He asks me if he can help in this situation, but what’s done is done, there’s no turning time back. I just can’t seem to forgive him anymore, because I don’t believe that he just “forgot” that he has old contacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he couldn’t think of it when I told him about the pictures and everything else. It feels like he doesn’t know how to think, he just does what I tell him to. Well, at least now I know his phone is completely clean of past girls and these situations would occur anymore, but now I feel like I have lost a piece of my feelings for him. He has been away for week and a half and I don’t really miss him, but I am waiting for his arrival and planning things with him. I just feel like he has to become more mature. This relationship is first serious one for him, but I have experienced it, so I don’t have pink glasses anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now, sometimes I still go through his phone, but I only check open tabs as he doesn’t close them and one contact caught my eye, I think he was searching a name in his contacts and one of them came up as “tinder girl”. I went through his contacts and found some girls saved with either a flame or blushed smiley, one even was named as “my boo” and it wasn’t me, I was saved as “name and a heart”, so again, I told him about it and he cleared his contacts but I didn’t say anything further. I was really disappointed. I found it one day before he had to go to another country for work, so I didn’t want to ruin the day we had.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I get the spark back? Can I bring back that lost part of my feelings? Do you think that I could forget this all and time would heal? Every advice for keeping the relationship is welcome, thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. He has been always kind and helpful. He sometimes plans dates, gets me flowers every month, because he knows I like them. He really wants to keep the relationship, I know he loves me and he will always be faithful. He started to make time more for me, now when he is off work, he looks up date ideas, he tries to solve my problems with me or even for me when I don’t have time (like looking up a good hair removal laser clinic or operation that I need).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have deleted my spicy photos from his phone when I found out about the screenshots and haven’t sent him anymore and he stopped asking, because it was making me feel more hurt.

      "My husband (M29) and I (F26) have hit yet another rough patch in our marriage. I’ve made numerous Reddit posts in the past regarding issues in our marriage that I’ve either hidden or deleted out of fear. My husband and I got married after 28 days of courtship. We both knew we wanted to be married and we had always struggled to find partners who wanted the same thing (a God centered marriage). \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband has a child from a previous relationship. He was 19 and in college when he had a kid and when I came into his life, his child was 3 and he got along fairly well with his child’s mother when I first got with him. After we got married she requested more child support and took him to court. She was granted her request and it led to financial hardship, but we made it work. Once his kid started school she filed for full custody and as a result we rarely see his kid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before us having a kid, he was a pastor and had a small church. During this time we would get into fights where he would yell at me, call me degrading names, break things around the house and throw things at me. There were times where he would make his praise team wear shoes in the house because of the broken glass all over our floors. After only a few months of being with him I was already ready to take my losses and leave but after speaking to family and elders they encouraged us to work it out and go to God. Long story short, he quit ministry since we were struggling and he didn’t have anymore help to run his church (eventually our friends and family stopped coming to our church).  \n",
      "\n",
      "After the church ended and I got pregnant, we decided to move in with his mom and we were still having issues of him being emotionally hurtful towards me and I again contemplated divorce but stuck it out so our kid could be in a home with mom and dad. After he quit his job to do YouTube I kept working and was taking care of our newborn while working from home. I was the main one providing financially and taking care of our newborn while also keeping his mother’s home clean. I was overwhelmed and stressed so he told me I could come off my job and we would live off of his YouTube income and cash aid. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 2 years we have been living with different family members and he doesn’t make much on YouTube. This year he decided to go back to school to earn a degree (I am also in school and almost finished) so that he can become a teacher while working YouTube on the side. He also does Amazon flex for extra income, but he can be quite sloppy at times with his delivery and as a result he has an at risk standing. (I get frustrated by it because I tried to help him with his deliveries but if something seems complicated or he doesn’t want to find the specific apartment or locker he gives up and marks the package undeliverable which leads to your rating going down.) \n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn’t see his kid much and it bothers me to see them living a life far from God and being influenced negatively. When he reaches out to his child (10) they don’t respond and they often times seem disinterested in a relationship with him. I feel that it’s a result of not paying child support and us not having our own home for his kid to come to and be with us at. When I address my concerns he tells me I am disrespectful and not a submissive wife. I asked him if we could go to counseling to work out our differences and see eye to eye but he said he doesn’t want to go to counseling “just to hear them say the same exact things he already tells me”. \n",
      "\n",
      "He says that our relationship doesn’t work because of my bad attitude and abrasive tone when addressing things that concern me. We currently live with my grandma and we have no savings. I recently had a miscarriage and it opened my eyes to so much. A lot of our marriage was spent with me supporting his dreams and passions even though it put us in financial hardship. He spent a lot of time putting me down and telling me that I am an “inadequate wife who doesn’t know how to be a wife or a mother and that it isn’t my fault because my mother abandoned me as a child”. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that really put me off was when I saw he had been looking at my little sister’s and my friend’s social media accounts on a daily basis. When I confronted him about it he said it was because he was trying to hook up his friends (his friends are married and he essentially helped one of his friends cheat on his wife.) with my friend and sister. A part of me doesn’t believe him but I don’t know what to believe. I would hate to think he has been lusting over my friend and little sister because the type of posts they make are very flirty with lots of skin showing. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw what he had been doing behind my back, it shifted something in me because I had been feeling like I was a terrible wife this whole time but I took a step back and saw the constant sacrifices and pain I have endured all while being told how horrible I was and in the entirety of our relationship he has not taken care of us. When I first got with him his credit was shot and had no savings but he always had to have a brand new car and the latest iPhone. He used my savings that I came in with to pay off debts and over time my credit went down bc of cars he bought in my name that he ended up losing because he quit his job. I worked the first half of our marriage and when I stopped to be at home so did he and the government as well as family have been keeping us afloat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout our marriage we’ve had disagreements about finances, biblical viewpoints, his relationship with his kid (I feel he could do more), and what he sees as disrespectful. (I don’t call him names or get irate but I do speak with passion at times). Today he is distant because I asked him last night if we could go to counseling and as a result he feels we are on the brink of divorce. I told him that all I want is true and genuine reconciliation and a deep connection with him. The conversation just centered around how I don’t listen, that I’m rude, and have a bad tone. He told me he is going to talk to a man he looks up to and when I asked if I could go with him, he said no. We agreed that I should go back to work and that we could just go 50/50 but he ultimately feels we are headed toward divorce. \n",

Then flashforward to a couple days ago and I notice shes being distant again so I try my best to keep talking to her. But she still keeps canceling plans and moving them back to a later time. She doesnt even bother to respond to my texts, til the day after, or after me texting her multiple times. \n",

      "Body text: Hello, everyone. This is a throwaway account because the subject of today's discussion, aka my best friend, knows about my main. Also, sorry if I am rambling in this long post. My emotions have been all over the place. I'm also doing my best to provide only the relevant information, but there is much more other context than this. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a little context, my best friend and I have been friends for about 15 years now. I (F22) just graduated college, and my best friend (F22) is working on her master's. I am fully aware that graduate school is very demanding, and she has expressed to me numerous times how stressed she has been. I really appreciate her being open with me, as that's how we have always been. Throughout elementary, middle, and high school, we have both gained and lost friends, but the experiences have only brought us closer. Until recently, besides each other, we didn't have any other close friends. Sure, we have friends at school and family friends, but the depth and extent of our friendship really doesn't compare with anyone else. I say \"until recently\" because after years of having one-sided crushes and failed situationships, my best friend finally got into a relationship with a guy last summer. I was really happy for her when she told me because the guy seems very sweet, and it's all she has ever wanted. For the record, it's a long distance (and by long distance I mean international) relationship, so she won't be seeing him again until next month. \n",
      "\n",
      "From what I've described so far, this might sound like a classic \"ditches-best-friend-for-boyfriend\" scenario, which it could be. What I find odd is that quite literally up until a month ago, things were completely fine. She lives in the city for school, about an hour away from me in our hometown, so we don't get to meet in-person often. That's why we FaceTime each other, and we've had no problem with this whatsoever. However, because of a time difference, she only gets to communicate with her boyfriend during the morning or at night. Sometimes, we'd talk during those times, but I was okay with letting her have that time to speak with him since that was the only time they got. Of course, we planned our way around that, and things worked out just fine. She'd keep me up to date with what's going on in her life and relationship, and I'd do the same (except the relationship updates, lol). \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last couple of months, we have barely spoken to each other. A few weeks leading up to spring break (mid-March), I had been asking her every week if we could call each other to which she has said no every time with a different reason each time. Granted, she is extremely busy, so I let it go without much thought. Eventually, I stopped asking because it was clear that she was occupied with other things, and we have an unspoken understanding to reach out whenever this kind of busy period ended. But, she didn't reach out until nearly a month later. Of course, she texted me the typical \"how's it going\" and that school has been kicking her ass, to which I joked how it's been a month without a single word. We texted for a bit talking about common end-of-semester events and life in general, and I brought up a trip she had taken recently to one of her cousins' place. Again, she's not entitled to tell me everything, but I had that expectation because she would tell me things like this before. It hurt more because everytime I tried to make plans to just talk to her over the phone, she kept telling me that she's busy. But somehow she has time to go on a spontaneous trip? I also have it on good authority that she has been texting her boyfriend every morning and every night. Basically, she has time for everyone but me. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, out of the many things we talked about, there were two things that hurt me the most: \n",
      "\n",
      "One, she told me how she couldn't come to any of my graduation events because she was going back to her cousins' to watch over their dogs while they went on a trip of their own. I've been long overdue to take a trip to see my grandparents overseas who aren't doing too well, but I haven't been able to go because I have no one who can look over my cat (and other pet boarding/care options are not possible in my case). Every time I've asked her, she beats around the bush and doesn't just straight up say yes or no. I've even explained that it won't be much of a responsibility and that I'll only be gone for a maximum two weeks, but I've gotten no real response from her. (To anyone wondering if she's allergic or scared of cats, no, she's not. Also, she has met my cat many times before, and she even tells me how her man really wants cats and that they'll be getting some in the future.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Two, she told me that she was staying in the city for the summer. She made no indication that would be coming over back to her hometown to visit during the time off nor did she welcome me to come over to her place. Usually, over the summer, we'd spend a lot of time together on walks in the evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "To make long story short, she asked if we could meet, which I initially said yes but ended up canceling because it was a day before guests were arriving for my graduation weekend, and my family and I were busy preparing. (And, to be honest, I was upset with her and wasn't in the mood to see her and talk.) She asked if she could come over for a minute at my place to give me a graduation gift, and I couldn't avoid that, so we ended up sitting and chatting then. I hadn't fully recovered from my emotions, and she caught wind of my unusually low energy and disinterest right away. She asked me if I was okay, to which I said yes. She then asked if it was because I was tired, to which I said yes because I wasn't ready for telling her truth and possibly having a confrontation. We chatted for about half an hour, my cat came to play with her, and then she left because it was time for dinner. I looked at her gift and thanked her for that afterward over message and told her that spending time with her is the best gift I could ever receive. Only then did she suggest that I come to the city. I told her how that'd require someone to drop me because I don't have my own car. It's been two weeks, she only liked the message with no response, and we haven't spoken since then. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have this heavy feeling in my chest, and I can't get rid of it. It's hard for me to eat, sleep, and function, to be honest. But I really don't want to reach out first. I understand this may seem childish and is probably my ego getting in the way, but if I have been trying my absolute best to just speak to her for a few minutes to no avail, should I really keep doing so? If I'm not as important to her anymore as she is to me, what can I do? As desperate as this sounds, I don't have anyone as trustworthy as her to talk to. The way I'm open with her, I can't be with anyone else. The bond we have had all these years comes from a place of deep trust and lack of judgment. She has told me in the past that I, too, will find a love like hers, despite my deep trust issues and complete disinterest in traditional romantic relationships. She understands the part of me that I say will never be \"normal\" and accepts me just the way I am. I don't know if I can live without her. She is like my sister. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please, help me understand this situation and give me some advice. I truly don't know what to do. Do I need to wait it out? Or should I communicate this with her? \n",

The family home will be left to my partner and his sister, they have planned for my partner and I to move everything back there and help his soon to be grieving sister renovate and sell the house (doing this ourselves on a budget will take 1-2years). So basically something tragic is changing our course but I don’t want to move back. Am I selfish? We are also trying to conceive and the more stress of moving etc the less odds we have at this age.

      "Body text: My 25F boyfriend 33M is a die hard carnivore and I’m vegetarian. Now I don’t care that he eats meat. My whole family does. Most my friends do. It’s never been a dating perimeter or even preference for me before. But this boyfriend is an extreme carnivore. He needs meat with every meal so we literally eat nothing the same. It wasn’t super bothersome at first but it is getting a bit annoying. Even with things like oatmeal, he puts sausage, butter, and raw milk in his. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also gets takeout probably 5 times a week which I think it excessive, expensive, and unhealthy. I stopped saying anything to him about this anymore. It’s his money, his health, fine, whatever. He has said 1x a week many times and never does that. So I stopped saying anything. He does this because he says we have “no food” at our apartment— of course we have A TON of food but his meat is too frozen and he won’t buy any pantry or freezer staples. Legit will not buy. He also thinks his takeout of burger and fries fast food is health. How fast food burger or fries or chicken nuggets are healthier than frozen ones (which he won’t buy bc unhealthy) is beyond me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to my next point of he also thinks he eats healthy which I wholeheartedly disagree with but don’t even say anything anymore because what’s the point. But that’s a problem. Besides the meat, he does raw milk, unpasteurized cheese, thinks spinach is bad for you, compared my no sugar added instant oatmeal to glazed donuts…. just a few examples. Now this in and of itself is not a dealbreaker but it does worry me with kids in the future how much we disagree on diet and food. We eat totally opposite diets. I am not opposed to my kid eating meat (though not my preference) but not all the time and certainly not saturated in butter and beef tallow. I’m not making chicken nuggets from scratch either. \n",
      "\n",
      "He has other beliefs like not using sunscreen, no bleach or any chemicals (fair to an extent), anti-plastic (fair but his aversion is VERY extreme), cotton only materials, etc. Some we would fight but could princely compromise on.

      "\n",
      "I will acknowledge he is not wrong in *most* of these opinions but these are his opinions and not objective facts (though many in the minority) and I have different opinions which worry me for the future how we will parent. He views his opinions as objective though. I firmly believe in sunscreen, no raw, etc as do many doctors which will agree with me but he doesn’t think doctors know everything. He doesn’t think I eat healthy and I would say I eat very healthy. We have very different definitions of “healthy” I suppose. It does bug me I can acknowledge his subjective stance of food is valid (kind of) and he invalidates mine. \n",

      "For a little back story, we were dance partners and would train together 2-3 times a week for almost a year. During that time, he started bringing me small gifts and I would ask him to walk me to my car after training for safety. That led to him fixing numerous small things on my car and even a couple significant fixes over time, all of which was his idea. On occasion he would give me larger gifts, and even a really thoughtful one on Valentine’s Day. We would regularly talk in the phone, normally for 1-3 hours but also small things here and there. He was always there for me in times of need. We would do random things outside of training. And then we would train things that required close proximity. We were basically committed to only training with each other, so we both put a lot of time and effort into that. I actually think I was his closest person, since he was literally always available for me and worked his plans around mine. Even on short notice.\n",

      "Towards the end of everything, he asked me on a road trip to something he knew I would enjoy, which didn’t end up happening because I cut things off. Now, if we were dance partners and none of the others things outside of training occurred, I wouldn’t have thought anything if it. But I started to get feelings for him. I would drop little hints or openings, like asking him if he gets all his friends thoughtful gifts in Valentine’s Day. He would flirt and I would flirt back, but we never kissed or anything like that. I did eventually address it, and told him how I was feeling and he said he didn’t feel the same way. I was crushed, but accepted it, and said we couldn’t be partners anymore. I didn’t explain it why but I knew I couldn’t handle it. He also never pushed.\n",

Like, any of the things on their own would seem friendly but all of it combined seemed like too much effort for someone just trying to be friends. I’m also feeling hurt because, after all the time we spent together, he hasn’t said anything to me since. Didn’t even try to show care for us continuing to dance together.

      "Body text: Hi! Recently I (30F) have been pulling away from my partner (29M), I know I have issues with relationships because of my past but it's been a little over a year and I'm wondering if I'm picking at small, unimportant things or if what I'm bothered by is real. \n",
      "\n",
      "It started small, we met through mutual friends and in the getting to know you phase, he talked himself up (I always assume there's a bit of fluff added at this point) and I learned shortly after officially dating that he had (no surprise) exaggerated quite a bit on things he told me about himself.\n",

      "He was in police academy when we met and is now an actual cop and it's our ONLY point of conversation. Even when we're talking about something completely unrelated, he circles it back around to police stuff. I've talked to him openly about how that bothers me, he's acknowledged it but hasn't stopped. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently, he's been SUPER clingy, always wanting me over at his house, constantly saying I need \"kisses and snuggles\" (I am not a physically affectionate person and he's very aware of that), and we got into a disagreement a couple weeks ago and when he approached me to apologize, he said \"I'm sorry you felt frustrated\" which is not an apology. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've talked to him about all of these things, so I'm making sure I communicate, but things are bothering me more and more because he's not making any moves to stop or adjust the things I've been open with him about. \n",

      "\n",
      "Recently, he told me that for the 1.5 weeks leading up to his test, he wants to study alone. We have been studying together in his room pretty much daily until now. His reasoning is that I make loud noises by moving around too much (going to the bathroom, drinking water, typing) and he wants to establish a routine being alone on test day, as I won't be testing with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the past 3 years of medical school (except summer breaks where we have gone back to our homes in different states), I have essentially lived in his room. Our first two years, we spent all our time together because we had the same classes. This past year on rotations, although we were in different parts of the hospital, I still ate dinner and spent every evening with him.\n",

      "I have also tried being quiet and not making any noises, but he always notices some sound that I unintentionally make. He already wears noise cancelling headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand his decision of wanting to study alone. But why do I still feel really sad? So much so that I started crying for a solid 10 minutes after he told me. I feel myself acting coldly towards him and I can't even explain why, when I logically understand where he's coming from.\n",

      "I know a lot of people that come and go in my life. Actually, recently I cut off about 20 people in a short amount of time without feeling anything. Because I know damn well those people actually aren't like anyone and had great minds, it was for the best because they weren't true friends or they didn't actually consider or care about me. I might still try to get in contact with some of them, but I know those aren't my people.\n",

I know her from 5 years online because she was living abroad. But I got blocked recently without anything said, though she said she was willing to help me in my hard times, and I actually refused to not put pressure on her. She just one time said that she doesn't like to be or feel pressured, which I think I did respected it enough.  we had an agreement to only read my messages when she was willing to and only talk to me when she can, and she could've just said not now or I'm tired, let's talk later, but she just blocked me after calling me her closest person. Outside of the 20-something people that I cut off and all people I know well, I won't find someone like her. She treated me as a family member, truly loved me, and offered help a lot to me. I used to overshare with her, although outside of her, I share very minor details now. She just made me comfortable and excited to share my day with her. Months later, about 6 months in, I dream of the day to meet her. I remember all the kind words and love I never witnessed, the wisdom I never saw because she was highly educated and updated on science and social sciences. I really miss it, truly, even more than my ex that I truly loved more than myself at times.\n",

      "Title: I (30M) think that my best friend (23NB) has been lovebombing me. How do I broach this with them?\n",
      "Body text: I (30M) became really close with my best friend (23NB) towards the tail end of last year. Before then we were in each other's orbits and fairly close but since we started working together we became pretty inseperable. This surprised me to be honest. Obviously there's quite an age gap, but we work in hospitality where this isn't uncommon. You kind of make friends with everyone, we just happened to get really really close.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite intense to be honest. We had deep conversations, they would send me videos about how cool it was for them to finally have someone they could call their best friend (something we bonded over early, as we're both neurodivergent and struggle to connect with people). They sent me poetry they wrote about how much our friendship meant to them. They said they'd ask me to be their best man when they get married to their girlfriend, and I extended them the same offer. It felt so good to be able to just express how much they meant to me, and to have them respond in kind. It felt *nice* to finally have someone that cared so openly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 2 months, something has shifted however, and it's making me think I'm going fucking crazy. They stopped sending me stupid little videos, saying that they were trying to focus on not doomscrolling as much. Ok, sure, that's reasonable. Then they asked me to stop asking them how their day was going, because it made them feel pressured to perform (whatever that means). But fine, I'm a good friend, I'll acquiesce and do whatever it takes to help them be comfortable. Now I'm lucky to hear from them at all. My Instagram used to get about 120 notifications a day, mostly from them. Now, I get 6. Every time I try to organize time to hang out, they are busy or have something else to do or are too fatigued. Today, we closed together, and they didn't say a single word to me aside from the odd comment about the close. When we closed together two months ago, we would accidentally stay 30 minutes over, off the clock. Now it feels like they can't wait to get away from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've brought this up a couple of times with them. They always seem to have something to say about it. \"I promise we're fine, I just go people blind when I don't see them\", or \"I promise we're fine, I just have a lot going on. Don't ask me about it, it stresses me out.\" or \"I promise we're fine, I just don't want to be on my phone anymore\". I feel like it's gotten to the point where if I talk to them again about this, it'll break the friendship in half. Every time I work with them, or see them, I leave the encounter feeling like utter shit. Angry at myself and like I'm not worth anything to them anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spoken to my other friends about how they've made me feel and they've noticed no difference in the way they communicate with me. They said they're probably just stressed or something, but nothing is wrong. It's making me feel like I'm insane, like something has changed but if nobody else has noticed it, am I going crazy?\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I need to discuss this with them but I can't just do it while we're on shift together, and I *definitely* don't want to do it over the phone. I want to preserve the friendship, more than anything because I don't want my other friends to have to pick sides in case shit goes nuclear, and because I still have to work with them. This isn't like a romantic relationship, my entire social life could be ruined if I don't handle this with grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be said, that comes August, they'll be moving away. Worst case scenario, I can just ride it out til they go and I never have to see them again, but this person is such an important part of my life that I don't want to let them go. I do, sincerely, care about them. Like I would forgive them for all of it if I could just make them see how this has affected me and there was some kind of actionable change.\n",

      "Have I been lovebombed? Or am I overreacting? How do I navigate this topic? How can I speak to them about this in a way where they'll actually hear me, and not handwave what I'm saying as a general desire for reassurance? Is this even salvageable, or should I just resign myself to the fact that every time I look at them for the next two months, I'll feel like a worthless piece of garbage and hope that when they leave I won't be *too* devastated, just letting the bridge fall apart on its own?\n",

I cried in front of her and let myself be vulnerable, thinking she was really there for me.\n",

But when I asked her to show me the texts, I saw how she actually responded to him: saying stuff like “I’ll do it, don’t worry” and “don’t worry king, I’ll do it.” It didn’t feel like someone being threatened. It felt like someone agreeing to play along.\n",

      "\n",
      "After that, Alex texted me trying to act like he was being mature, saying the situation “got out of hand,” and that what I saw was an “over-exaggeration.” He admitted there were problems but said they “can’t be fixed” and that he feels bad, but we should just move on. Not once did he actually take responsibility for lying to me or for what he told Emily to do. He tried to spin the whole thing to make it seem like I’m the one overreacting. It felt like a complete deflection.\n",

      "\n",
      "There is one issue that is really eating away at me though.  I have this feeling that sometimes nothing is \"enough\" for her and she's \"on my case\" much more often than I would like.  I try to be the best boyfriend I can be and often times, I feel like I do more than most guys are probably doing, although this could be in my head.  I am essentially self employed in the real estate investment/brokerage world so I make an incredible income ($500-750k/yr) for my age and have access to very lucrative investment opportunities as well.  I view this as a golden opportunity to set us up for life and make sure we never have to worry about money when we have a family and give us a level of freedom most people can only dream of. However, that comes at a cost as I have to work a lot and sometimes things change quickly, I lose track of time, I get stressed about work and bring it home with me etc.. With that being said, I still dedicate a lot of time to our relationship and work around 50 hours per week.  Most evenings I set my phone down and try to be very present with her, I try to help her out around the house when she needs it, we take our dog on walks, I spend time/energy participating in hobbies/activities that she really wants to do, but I would probably never do on my own (gardening for example).  I also don't work on the weekend anymore so we can spend time together. Not complaining about this at all, just an observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just moved in together a few months ago and had this agreement that I would pay the majority of rent at our house and she would take care of most things around the house.  For the most part, this has been the case however she does often ask for my help on things, but it's usually small things that pale in comparison to what she's doing around the house.  She has incredibly high standards for basically everything and if something isn't done perfectly she gets really upset.  This has lead to a lot of fights and is our biggest issue.  Its tough because I genuinely feel like I'm trying, and I'm spending far more time on \"house\" related activities than I ever have in my life, but it still seems to fall short of her expectations more often than not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recent example was this week.  We got a ton of her things out of storage and moved them all into our house and it's a LOT of stuff.  It's been a massive project getting the house setup, getting things organized in a meaningful way etc.. She works from home and I go into an office, so the past 2 weeks or so she has been working on the house a lot while I'm away at work. I come home and help out in the evenings and will help out on the weekends, but she's def doing a lot more than me.  These are all her belongings and she wants the house to be setup a very specific way, so it can be difficult for me to help if she's not there because if I don't do it exactly the way she wants, it's counterproductive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 nights ago she told me she's been very overwhelmed with the house stuff and she feels a bit of resentment that I get to go to work and leave it all for an entire day while she's stuck with it.  She said she needs more help.  I told her I would work from home yesterday and wake up early to help before work, and then find times throughout the day to help.  I woke up at 5am with her, got some things done around the house and then started my work day.  I had 3 periods where I didn't have to do anything for 45min-1 hour and went up to her home office to ask what she wanted help with.  She was really busy with work and didn't have the time to think of anything really big I could do without her, so she gave me a handful of smaller tasks such as dishes, trash, etc.. I did all of them, however when I did the dishes I was on a work call and carelessly left a few lids in the sink.  I also left my morning coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I was on a work call so wasn't giving the dishes my full attention but got 90% of them done (along with everything else she asked me to do) and then walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple of hours later, she got very upset with me about the dishes.  She said you told me you'd help me today, you barely helped at all and you couldn't even finish the dishes right because you were on a work call.  She told me she often feels like my job is my number 1 priority and she feels like she's in 2nd position.  I felt pretty hurt as I had woken up so early to get things done, I had agreed to work from home and I had done everything she asked me to do and had set time periods aside to help her and here I was getting yelled at for leaving a few lids in the sink and my coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I told her I came up to her office several times throughout the day to ask what she needed help with and it's not my fault she didn't have anything meaningful for me to work on.  She felt that I was doing the dishes when I was on a work call and didn't finish them to completion, and this made her feel like my job was more important than helping her around the house after I promised that the house would be a priority today.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got in a big argument and I definitely pushed back.  To me this feels a bit crazy because I followed through on everything we talked about except the 3 lids in the sink and the coffee mug but her immediate reaction was to look at what I didn't do right instead of what I did do right.  To her, this felt like she really didn't give me a ton of stuff to do and the few things she did ask me to do, I couldn't do right because I was more focused on work.  She felt that I made a promise I would prioritize the house and then I was carelessly working on the small tasks she gave me while on a work call.  Something of this same nature has been a recurring theme in our relationship.  It will often surprise me as well,  I'll come home and do things with her for 3 hours and then she'll still get upset about something or make comments insinuating that she's just doing everything in this relationship. Some days things are incredible, other days it feels like no matter what I do, she will get upset with me for something that feels small or insignificant to me. She told me the biggest thing that bothers her is when I say I will do something and then I either don't or do it in a half-ass way because my job  gets in the way.  However I feel if I'm honest with her and just straight up say \"I don't have time to help with that today because I have to work\" then she will also get upset.  I spend many multiples more time working on house related activities than I did when I was single and it still seems to fall short of her expectations often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to reiterate I really do love this girl and want to marry her, but this feeling I have inside is hard to ignore.  This is our only real issue and everything else is nearly perfect.  This is not my first serious GF, but this is my first time living with a girl so I'm wondering if this is a normal thing when moving in with someone or if we're actually more incompatible than we thought (or I'm just being an asshole).  If we're looking at this relationship logically from a \"value-add\" standpoint, my biggest value-add is my income/investments and financial strength.  Her's is handling our personal lives and the house (cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dog, keeping our lives interesting with fun trips etc..).  I feel an immediate benefit from her \"value-add\" as I come home to a beautiful, clean home every day with a delicious meal cooking.  She feels an immediate benefit on the financial side to some extent because I pay for significantly more than she does, however I feel the benefit I am providing is more of a long term benefit, not something you feel right here right now.  I'm wondering if that's contributing to this.  Curious what the Reddit community thinks about this whole thing and what the best next steps are.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - I feel like I'm spending way more time on \"house\" related chores/activities than I ever have before, but it seems to consistently fall short of my girlfriends expectations.   She often feels like she's 2nd priority behind my job, simultaneously I feel like I'm working less than I ever have to make sure I have time to help her and spend time with her.\n",

      "\n",
      "his mom asked us when worked best, so I told my roommate that my boyfriend's birthday was in the upcoming months and that I didn't want to go anywhere close to it. but when we finally reached out with a timeline, his mom said she had already planned the dates... the trip starting the day right after my partner's birthday.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's sort of frustrating that i was offered this trip and asked when would work, but at the same time.. it's a free trip to disneyland. i started to try and just think of positives: ok, not on the actual birthday.. i can still make something happen and make it special. i can also just ask how my partner feels about me going on a trip so close because i value his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "so.. i called him up. i had already prefaced to him a couple weeks ago that this trip was happening. i told him that i found out the trip was happening a day after his birthday and wanted to make sure he was okay with it. on the phone, he seemed really hurt by it. i went on a trip a week before his birthday last year with his family, and he brought up how he had wished it didn't happen two years in a row. i asked him if he wanted me to not go and he responded with \"i would never tell you to not do that\". i told him that i have been planning to make the day of his birthday special no matter what. after i said that, he wanted some space since he was feeling upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "for the record him being hurt is TOTALLY valid in my eyes. me and my partner have been wanting to go to disneyland together for so long but money has made that difficult for us to plan, so the trip happening for me for free without him.. let alone near his birthday, it just really sucks. i already was trying to think of special plans for his birthday day, which i would be 100% avaliable for, but he says the excitement of me going to the parks is probably just going to dull whatever comes before the trip. im at a total loss of what to do. this trip ironically is coming at a good time after a recent failed reconnection with my birth mother, and i could really use fun chosen family time right now.. but i don't know if going is just going to induce bitterness/sadness for my partner in the long run. i guess my question is, IS there a right thing to do in this situation? either way i feel like im going to feel bad. im open to any advice or insight.\n",

      "Body text: So I don’t know if I’m over exaggerating, but this whole situation makes me literally feel like I need to throw up. Basically last year I had my internship at this reptileshop for 8 weeks and that is where I met my ex. We would get along really well and had a lot of joking and teasing around with each other. Even though he was way older than me (at the time 18 and he was 31) I still began catching feelings for him. I’ll spare you all the details on how it all happened but basically he started catching feelings for me too and one day he asked me to have a drink with him at a bar, so I did and we got a bit tipsy, wich made us both brave enough to confess our feelings towards each other. So we kissed and had sex that night and eventually after some days went by, we were officially in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met his family and his kids (yes he had two daughters) and everything went well. But he changed his whole personality when we were official. He was manipulative and stuff (too complicated and long of a story to type right now) but there was one thing he did that still makes me feel sick. He would have morning sex with me after I repeatedly said no because I was still tired and wanted to sleep longer or just because I don’t like morning sex. Two times I even cried during the morning sex after I said no multiple times and he was too horny to notice. My friends, who I at the moment of the relationship still lived with, all know about this, cuz I told them everything after we broke up. They also know that I was really not okay during the relationship, because I didn’t get out of bed, I didn’t go to school, I barely ate and had no energy to the point I couldn’t even stand for longer than a minute. We only dated for like a month after three months of getting to know each other. I broke up with him after a fight and he didn’t took the break up well, he send me long and weird manipulative paragraphs that I also showed to my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all of this they still chose to do the internship at the exact same place, when they know he works there. My friend even told me how enthusiastic she was and how her boyfriend (the other friend) has already talked a lot with my ex. The thing is they should be able to have their internship wherever they want and I totally get that they chose this one, cus it’s the nearest reptile shop from their house and they both love reptiles, but I just can’t handle the fact that they will be around my ex everyday for 8 weeks and not knowing what they’re talking about. I’m scared they might like him and become friends with him, cuz he’s very likable at first. I’m also scared that he will lie about things that happened and that they’ll believe him. I just don’t know what to do, cuz I feel betrayed by my friends but at the same time it seems unfair that I feel this way cuz they mean no harm. Am I being dramatic?\n",

      "Body text: When I got with my girlfriend, I was in a hurt state since everyone I dated either didn’t know what they wanted or would just date me but then leave. It lead me to believe that love doesn’t really happen; I wouldn’t find love and I would just have to make it happen with someone who “checks all the boxes” like having a good head on their shoulders, and loves me. And I didn’t need the spark to be there. I would let it be and grow one day at a time. Then I met my girlfriend who is a great person and is there for me all the time.

It would be hard and painful to break up with her yet the more I stay in the relationship, the more I’ll feel unhappy and just feel like I’m in the relationship to do the right thing for her but not for me.

      "Body text: Context:\n",
      "She is one of the most difficult people to talk with, we were friends since Highschool and were part of a group of 5 friends were she ended getting in a fight with everyone except me.\n",
      "I fear confrontation and I think I am a people pleaser, our relationship maintained because I avoided a lot of subjects I usually talk about. She is an extreme man hater - feminist - lesbian and also is pretty arrogant, she lectures you about your personality and why you are in the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all of that she was one of my best friends, I spoke to her daily, I have a lot of friends and our highschool friend group are still my closest friends so it was weird for me to just divide my time and attention.\n",
      "I think it's my fault to never confront her about her personality, when you speak about something \"she thinks is it the wrong\" she gets super pissed and annoying, just killing every vibe. Also she can't handle herself when she drinks, we can't just go to drink something on a Friday because she always wants to get wasted and it's annoying. I had to pretend I didn't drink anymore to avoid this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was always empathetic with her, but it was kind of like that relationship were you treat that person very cautious so she doesn't get mad and we managed to be friends for a long long time. When she was \"normal\" she was actually pretty fun and entertaining but it never lasted long, actually when we were not a 2 person dinamic she was always annoying and pissed about everything. If we were only the 2 of us it was normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When time passed, another highschool friend started speaking to us and we became pretty good friends the 3 of us, but our dinamic was always problematic. I'm gonna call my arrogant friend Jess and our new friend Dalu. It was like every time we were together life felt harsh, we only spoke about our problems and she was the judge and the advisor but not in a helpful way, she speaks very redundant and \"intelligent\" that you get lost in her words, sometimes you don't understand 100% what's her point but you felt judged and just bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Actual reason that caused it all:\n",
      "Time passed and Dalu got engaged, she celebrated her wedding in another state and invited us. I considered my SO to be my companion and I told something about that to Jess. Weirdly enough she told me that I needed to ask Dalu if that's okay for her because maybe she doesn't want any more guests. I asked Dalu if I could go with my fiance and she said no...which was weird for me but I thought, Jess was pretty happy with that response like \"I told you\". I've been dating my fiance for 6 years, we live together so they know it's an important part of my life.\n",
      "I thought it doesn't matter, we can still go together and you can just wait for me outside...Idk it was weird he wasn't allowed to go. Her wedding was pretty small, like 20 ppl small so I tried to be understanding, she invited only her closest.\n",
      "I asked Jess if it was fine for her or not if my fiance accompanied us on the trip, because I considered him to be my wedding companion but now he's just not invited. I proposed to rent an Airbnb with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathroom close to the weeding spot...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JESS GOT SUPER PISSED \n",
      "\n",
      "She made me feel horrible just for asking, telling me that it was my responsibility to assume that is a friend's trip, that if he wasn't invited why should he go, that if it's a couples trip what is her deal accompaning us. All sorts of things just rejecting the idea but also just eliminating herself from the minimum thought of the situation, she said that if that's the plan she would go on other bus, and rent another hotel...I thought this was just exaggerating. Like I'm asking you if it's okay for you, you can just say you prefer it's just the two of us. And for context, I thought we were friends the 3 of us, we have gone multiple times to drink something or I invited her to our house and everything was fine. Also I have gone on trips with my SO and other friends and never had an issue, I'm aware of when you can take your partner and when you cannot. The whole situation was underwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "AGAIN I ACCEPTED AND TOLD HER SHE WAS RIGHT \n",
      "\n",
      "that it was a friend's trip, and I apologized for asking. I told my SO the situation and he was understanding, he is just the most amazing person in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed and we were planning our trip, we agreed to sleep on the hotel were the wedding took place. But when choosing the returning buses we had an issue, I told her that I wanted to go early because I worked on Monday, so I wanted to arrive home to have some time to rest (Jess was unemployed at that time). She literally told me: \n",
      "\n",
      "-\"Well in that case you can just take this bus that goes at 4am, you can go to the station at that time and I'm aware of that. I will go on the 10am bus because I don't want to be sleepless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "EXCUSE ME?!\n",
      "\n",
      "She put the friend's trip card on my face to make me feel bad about taking my fiance. But in the return home there was not even a discussion, she will go in the 10am bus. That's the deal, if you want to go earlier we'll go. When it's dark, it'd alone, you are in another state GO ALONE.\n",
      "And I tried to explain to her that I don't want that situation, because we came together, and I also accepted to go on the 10am bus with her, to which she said \"I'm glad that our plans are the same\"(WTFFF)\n",
      "\n",
      "When the trip day came, it was weird to go on a bus with her but we were having a good time...until I said something related to dogs. I said I hated when people had bad behaved dogs and want to let them inside when visitors are around the house. To which she responded:\n",
      "\n",
      "-\"Yeah, kind of like when people want to take their boyfriend everywhere even uninvited\"\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT THE FUCK\n",
      "\n",
      "That instantly made me mad and uncomfortable, I think it ruined the whole trip for me and I became just more serious. She proceeded to give examples of her sister or her cousins but girlllll I don't care, what kind of fucking argument is that if we are speaking about dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the trip was bad, like annoying and bad, in just gonna give you super fast examples. She is egotistical and arrogant, the whole trip she was combing her hair EVEN WHEN DALU'S VOWS WERE HAPPENING, like can you leave your freaking hair a minute, this is an especial moment for our friends.  \n",
      "We went to eat something and she didn't ate with me,  it was fucking weird, I'm sitting eating alone and she's just waiting for me(?) once I finished she said \"finally we can go to burger king\"...\n",
      "She criticized our uber that took us from the bus station to the hotel because poor dudes cellphone got a little lag, she was horrible with that man.\n",
      "She criticized everyone, we stopped at a park at some point to rest and she was badmouthing every one sitting near.\n",
      "Once on the hotel she asked me if she could use the bathroom and I told her yes, just let me take my make up out AND SHE GOT PISSED like a 15 year old. Like if she didn't wanted to use the bathroom anymore because it was not when she wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whole trip was horrible... wedding was cute tho\n",

      "Once I got home I was so happy to see my fiance, just so happy to be home. Also I kind of ghosted her but not completely, I still sent her messages sometimes, but she didn't responded my last message which was last year. I think it was kind of mutual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, our friend Dalu lives in other country so she suggested that we record small videos to update our lives which we did except for Jess, she never sent anything because she doesn't like photos or looking at herself on camera. So it was basically Dalu and me sending videos and responding. I sent my last video on February were I said 2 súper important things:\n",

      "They still talked on the group chat about other stuff and I was super sad that they didn't saw my videos nor gave a single flying fuck. When I told about two important thing in my life. Dalu was returning home for a small period of time and she told us that she wanted to meet with us. So I just dropped a sarcastic \"resume\" about my 10minute video in two sentences like : \n",

      "\n",
      "-I'm sorry I didn't watched your videos, I guess that since Dalu and I had a call and she told me the information in her videos I never responded to hers also in the chat. I prefer a call, but there's also your preferences. I am sorry for your friend and absolutely I'll be on the wedding.\n",

      "WHAT?!\n",
      "\n",
      "THEY HAVE PRIVATE CALLS, ALSO it's not what I preferred, it was a dinamic that Dalu proposed and we were following. What the fuck are you talking about. Not even a congratulations just an \"I'll be there\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, fuck you. I just ghosted the entire group chat since then, Dalu sended me private messages apologizing which is fine, I'm not that mad at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with Jess I'm just fucking done, she is the worst friend I coul ever had, and I feel too stupid to realice just know. 15 years of friendship ti the trash, maybe it wasn't even a friendship it was just me letting her always get her way.\n",
      "Idk, but I dream about her often, and I think about her daily and it makes me mad. Dalu told me that Jess is pissed that I \"destroyed the friendship we had\" because I don't speak to them together anymore, when Dalu cama to town I watched her privately but not together. I don't know if I owe her an explanation, it feels wrong to just stop talking to her, but I'm aware that if I say something she is going to lecture me about why she is not wrong, why she is the way she is, blabla.\n",

      "Title: I (22F) am not inlove with my my husband (M23) anymore. I don’t know what to do\n",
      "Body text: Me and my husband have been married for almost 4 years now. He’s a narcissist, he has been physically, sexually (depriving to gain power and validation) emotionally and financially abusive a majority of our marriage. I’ve made posts regarding the details previously, I am and have been extremely unhappy in my marriage from the beginning. Well..I made a leap, and I decided to leave him a couple months ago. We live in Alaska, and I moved to Oregon for a few months. Well, he visited me in Oregon and begged to see me. I did, and I was surprised at the man he was. After he left, we started texting again. Eventually it turned into him agreeing to do therapy, promising to be better to me and better himself. He made some huge promises..saying he’ll never lay hands on me, and that he’ll be less hostile and more affectionate, not abandon me so often (he works on his fishing boat an hour away from home, he decides his own hours and often wakes up at 7am and comes home at 2am..other than that, he fishes all the time and rarely texts or calls me) and that he’ll continue doing therapy and that whatever I have issues with in his behavior-I could communicate them and he’ll work on it with the help of therapy..\n",
      "\n",
      "So I came back…\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he has not harmed me. Yes, he is really trying to be more affectionate and soft and romantic, yes he’s trying to hear my feelings out most of the time…but he’s still really mean at times randomly, he’s still super critical of me, he said that he has a huge problem with me communicating what I need him to change and work on in therapy, and at first he came home earlier as promised…but now he’s just back to working long long hours, leaving me abandoned again. He was listening to my problems at first but now he’s started saying “could you just sum up your feelings in 1 word” and when I explain that my feelings are more complex than just 1 word, he gets angry at me. He falls asleep when I’m crying next to him. He doesn’t ever wanna have sex once again, and it leaves me deprived even when I communicate my need for more intimacy. When he’s home, he acts like a dead fish and isn’t as affectionate like ever. I feel like everything is going back to the way it once was. When I tell him this, he calls me and makes me feel like I’m crazy. And I came back very hesitantly anyway, and now I just feel like his actions are chipping away more and more at my already broken heart. I’m laying here all alone, deprived of love, just unsure of what to do. I’m in a religion where divorce is VERY looked down upon…so if I divorce him, my friends and family will literally disown me. Theyll stop associating with me, stop talking to me. It’s such a scary leap, one of the big reason I even came back. \n",

But T is a good friend of mine, he helped me make the leap to leave my husband..saying that I don’t deserve any of it. When I came out there and wasn’t with my husband, he cheered me up and showed me softness. He made me feel so beautiful and cherished and like I was golden. We talked often, we had lots in common. We laughed ugly laughs together and had so many inside jokes. He showed me maturity…when I hinted i was going through lady issues and wasn’t feeling well, he flat out addressed my period as something not to be ashamed of..he even brought me food and a milkshake and danced to music in his vehicle with me. My husband is very disgusted even thinking about the fact I have a period, so this was shocking behavior for me to experience from another man. It’s like my sickness went away. We kissed, and he didn’t act disgusted like my husband always does. He made me feel sooo precious again. Absolutely warmed my heart. He talked about leaving the religion with me, and how he loves kids and would love to raise mine with him. He was just so sweet and he made me feel so good. I wanted to runaway with him, but I became too afraid. I told him everything I was going through every step of the way with my husband, he even tried giving me advice on how to make it work with him, poor thing. I know he really wanted us to be together. When I came back to my husband, I just never got anything close to that softness. All of that was ripped away due to my decision to avoid a bad reputation and try and make it work with him. \n",

I feel so awful for these emotions that I have because I’ve always been so deathly loyal to my husband…but I just feel like I’m not in love anymore.

      "So my **GF (21)F** moved to Senegal last month for a 3 months internship in international relations (its a way to finish her course at her uni), we've been together for about a year and a half and everything as far as I know is doing great (we tell each other we love each other everyday, send good morning and goodnight texts, go on dates etc.). I **(20)M** recently she had feelings for some 40 year old man in senegal , that's been driving her and her friend around in Senegal for free, she also told me that they kissed , apparently they were very drunk and she forgot about it, (she did that arround 2 weeks ago and didnt tell me). So tonight she was driving arround with him in his car , and he told her he was in love with her , she kinda freaked out and directly texted me as soon as she got home. We had a discussion about it and she told me she was sorry and wanted to talk it out, but she also had feelings for him, (apparently he's kind and has a good soul), I told her to stop texting him and she said it would be hard to not talk to him since he's driving her arround and she works with him too and she's not sure of her feelings either. She said to me she would love to live in Senegal and has nothing back in Montreal, she's been considering staying in senegal with him and escape her family (wich is a fair point because there's a lot of emotional abuse). All I know about her \\*crush\\* is that he's arround 40, he's nice and is having a decent life in Senegal. So how do I move on from, well this mess. I'm not mad at her , people can have crushes and everything I'm not the jealous type, but the fact that she was talking to him for well over a month and didn't tell me anything  is honestly soul crushing . So how do I move on from that , my first thought was to leave her and handle the consequences of her actions (but its just a kiss so I don't really care that much) , she says she loves me and everything but it falls a bit flat after leaving me in the dark for so long. (She also has feelings for him)  .So how do I move on from that , do I talk to her and let her live her life, or do I try and salvage that ship.\n",

There are so many triggers that set her off and this usually results in her making a series of accusations, that although founded, she wants to discuss all night long and into the next day. There seems to be no end in sight as this has been going on for years now. I'm exhausted. I want to give my children a good home and I've been failing miserably. I know both our actions had consequences that are impacting our kids. I for the most part have accepted what happened and have decided to move past it for the sake of the kids. Her on the other hand is having a very difficult time. She has had dark thoughts in the past. The mood cycles are killing me. She is angry, sad, leaves, comes back, makes demands, threatens divorce... I just want to reduce the collateral damage as much as possible.. My kids are great kids. We both love them very much. They do not know their mom is depressed, or why she is depressed, but of course, they are witnessing her just leave out of the blue and she sleeps on the couch often, so they know something is up, just not the details or how bad it is. I can't even bring myself to enjoy activities with them because I'm constantly anxious, sleep deprived trying to be supportive of her, and honestly, just feels very crappy when she is not there and I just know that we are in for a hellish 1 or two weeks until it sorta passes and then starts again the next month or so. I don't know if I should confide to the kids that their mom is depressed and I don't know how much I should tell them. I obviously do not want to make her out to be the villain. She will not see a therapist. That just won't happen. She goes over and over the same mistakes, although never really taking accountability for her transgressions. I just listen and try to deescalate because I want to avoid the chaos.. Divorce is not an options because in her condition, I fear that it would be worse for her and also the kids since I have a gut feeling that the depression will not go away after the divorce and then the kids will be the ones to pick up the pieces.\n",

      "Body text: Hi, I'm 27F, and - I need to mention this also - I'm a trans woman (so being in a relationship is very rare for me). I have a boyfriend (25M) since one month. In the beginning, I decided to give him a chance because he was very nice & sweet person and he was just average looking imo so I thought I could develop some romantic feelings towards him. He is a man who every woman could dream about. He works as an informatician, he gets paid a lot, he buys me roses or cookies every time we see each other, he sends me good morning & goodnight texts, he asks how I feel & has emotional capacity to understand people, he is very cuddly, he has helped me a lot during these two months since we've known each other.

I also don't get excited before our dates, he has an anxious attachment style probably (according to his psychologist), I am a fearful avoidant. But I have had sex with one blond man (exactly my type) and I was aroused, I liked spending time with him. I hate myself, I'm sorry, I should just love him, he's such a good person.

We both share a love of classic cars, listen to the same music and going to concerts together, love cooking good food together, love gaming, playing card games in pubs and going out for coffee and cake; the list could go on.

We might comment on things we like, i.e. \"this coffee is great\", \"I like his boots over there\", \"I can't believe how lucky we've been with the weather\", but it's just not stimulating in the slightest, and I feel like I desperately yearn for good, meaningful conversation to feel truly close to someone and to get to know them deeply.

      "Body text: Recently, I have had some issues with the way my boyfriend's parents set rules regarding our relationship. My boyfriend and I have had many conversations concerning his parents over the last week and we are unsure about what to do so here we are asking Reddit lol. He is also not happy with their decisions, however is of the opinion that it is \"their house and their rules \" so he isn't as upset about it as I am. My mom also agrees with my boyfriend on the concept of \"their house their rules\" and says I shouldn't rock the boat while my best friends are all passionately on my side (I have very good friends haha) so I'm even more split on what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "For background, I (20F) and my boyfriend, Nate (20M), have been together for almost 3 years and have been long distance for 2 of those 3 years for college. We go to college about 5 hours apart, both with intensive majors, so we only saw each other two weekends a month when I drove to stay with him since he didn't have a car until recently. Despite this, our relationship is very strong and we spend most of our time on FaceTime including between classes, doing work, driving, and even sleeping. Nate and I are the bestest of friends and we have no problems in our relationship other than this current issue. Before you ask, yes we have petty disagreements all the time but never stay mad for longer than an hour because we have great communication and an overall amazing relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "My relationship with Nate's parents, Frank (45M) and Caroline (45F) is also amazing, aside from my current feelings over this situation. They loved me even before we started dating and I have been invited for many vacations with them and am over at his house all the time even when Nate's not there. I have a great relationship with every member of his family including his siblings, grandparents, cousins, etc. Caroline and I are especially close, and as Nate and I are the eldest child of our families, our younger siblings often hang out with us all together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the issue. Over the course of our relationship, Nate has gone out of town for better paid summer jobs so this is the first year we will be able to spend a full summer together and we are super excited to do so. This is relevant because its the first time we are able to see each other regularly since high school while both of us live at home because while I go to school near our hometown, he has moved to the town he goes to college in. I've become upset with the way his parents have been setting rules in our relationship and feel that they are treating us as if we are still kids in high school. \n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest issue with his parents is that they won't allow us to hang out in his room together. Recently, we were playing video games on our respective laptops in his room with the door wide open when Caroline sent him a text that we needed to move to a different room, since we aren't allowed to be in there. This is how his parents always go about setting boundaries in our relationship, by sending him a text, having him inform me, and then they never speak about it to me. He and I were both frustrated by this, especially since his room is literally central to the house's floorplan with it being near the office, stairs, and front door, but didn't argue and moved to the dining room. Later that evening, another problem arose, where his parents reinstated their boundary of kicking me out of the house before they go to bed, which they also had while we were in high school. We were hanging out in the dining room at around 11pm with Nate on his laptop and I working on an art project, when they again sent him another text saying it was time for me to leave. I wanted to finish the color I was currently working on, as I had just sprawled out the materials for it, but because he didn't want to get yelled at by his parents, he started packing up my materials for me so I could get out faster. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is also not the only issue that has arose this week either. Nate, at 20 years old, still is required to come home at whatever time his parents text him to be back from my house. This includes to run errands for them or as a curfew which can be anytime from 9:30-midnight depending on when they plan on going to bed that evening. This is because they say he must be home before they go to bed so they can \"lock up\". I find that excuse extremely frustrating as Nate has the ability to get in the house when it is locked through a garage door app on his phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that has really frustrated me is they have started to make concessions on their rules, so long as they have a good excuse for them. The most recent revelation, is that Nate is now allowed to spend the night at my house, but again only if there is a good reason. These reasons have ranged from weather, to hiding gifts from him, and to needing to use his bedroom for someone else to sleep in. However I am not allowed to stay the night at his house and he cannot stay at mine without any good reason, trust me I've tried. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I am allowed to stay the weekend at his residence that they pay for in his college town and we have even stayed a week at his family's Airbnb alone at Caroline's suggestion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We run into at least one of these issues pretty much once a day and I'm really tired of it. After last week when I was essentially kicked out, I had a good cry about it and spoke to Nate on the phone about how much everything was upsetting me and he agreed that he needed to have a conversation with his parents. That conversation however, went nowhere and even though Nate informed them about how upset I was, they just told him that we needed to respect their rules. Again they never spoke to me about anything even though it is a week later, Caroline just asked me why I haven’t been over this week when I picked something up from their house today and I just told her I was busy.\n",

For reference, again Nate and I are the oldest, we each have one sibling in high school, each one sibling in middle school, and Nate has one more sibling of toddler age. His toddler age sibling is one that we babysit individually and often together, especially when no one is home.

      "Body text: Me (19M) and my girlfriend, let’s call her R (18F) have seen dating for a couple months. RIGHT before we started dating, R and her best friend, call her E (18F), planned a trip to the beach for senior week (I graduated last year). At the time they booked it, E had a boyfriend and was bringing him along. R made a comment or two about it, and E said something along the lines of “don’t worry we’ll find you a man when we’re there.” Now for some context, E is a very self absorbed person. Fast forward to now, E got dumped by her boyfriend, and R brought up the idea of bringing me along on this trip, but E denied, saying she wants it to be a “girls only” trip. This seems a little hypocritical of her considering she was planning on bringing her boyfriend at first. I don’t think R has mentioned it again, only the once. To be completely honest, I’m feeling left out and not entirely comfortable with R being in a party city with her self absorbed and party loving friend for almost a whole week. I feel bad for wanting to bring this up to R because I feel like I’m inviting myself and overstepping. What should I do?\n",

      "Body text: Hi! I (26F) and my friend from college (26F) both moved into the same apartment building. She lives on the floor above mine. One weekend she put me along with a bunch of our mutual friends in a group chat because she wanted to have a barbecue on our roof. She has hosted many before, but this would be the first one I ever attended. Because I don’t eat red meat I did not eat anything that was cooked on the grill and only brought chips a bottle and paper plates. When the day was over, the group of us went downstairs to watch a reality show. My friend who lives in my building and the girl who owned the grill discussed that they would leave the grill to cool off. Once the reality show it was over, I went back to my apartment and went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day everyone in my building receives an email saying that there was a fire on the roof last night because someone dumped coals in the trashcan on the roof and they re-lit due to the wind. I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to my friend who then put it in the group chat of everyone. her and our other friend, who owned the grill, told us that they decided to take the grill home the same day because they didn’t wanna have to come back and get it the next day. So the girl in my building gave the grill owner her keys to go get the grill on the roof and the grill owner decided that it would be the best thing to just toss the coals into the trashcan on the roof. Our building requires multiple key taps to get on and off the roof and they also have cameras so they immediately told  my friend in my building she was responsible since it was her guest using her keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, my friend came to me and asked me to put it on my insurance since she nor the grill owner, had renters insurance. I spoke with a few lawyers and my old insurance agent, and they all said that this would be fraud. So I told my friend I did not feel comfortable doing so. Another week goes by and she asked me again because she believed that she would have to go bankrupt over the situation (she did not). I again said no because I did not feel comfortable and reiterated that I was told that this would be fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "From then, she started to run a smear campaign, saying that I was the bad friend and all of our friend group stop talking to me because they said that I should’ve at least tried to put it on my insurance. They now all want me to apologize to all of them and work for their friendship again since they believe that I was in the wrong but I feel like I didn’t do any wrong. So WITA?\n",

He’s rethinking grad school now, saying it might be smarter to get work experience first. He applied to MBA programs and jobs while finishing undergrad, graduated early in December, and got into the program he planned to attend. Now he’s planning to defer and focus on the job search instead.\n",

That was painful, especially since I’d turned down opportunities because no help was available. I just wish I’d known.\n",

After I said no, they decided to use both funds to help him and figured they’d replenish mine later.\n",

      "I get why it made sense to them, but it still hurt. Many commenters pointed out the situation was sexist, even if unintentionally. It’s hard not to feel like I was expected to get married while my brother was expected to succeed. I don’t think that’s what they meant, but that’s how it felt. To their credit, they listened.

      "We were hoping that FiL would agree to sign the house over to BiL and DH now and I would buy BiL's share. BiL isn't moving back and is also happy that we are back home to look after his parents in their old age. We understand that FiL gets a top up to his pension from rent and were happy to continue paying this- but with our names as owners. We thought that this way, everyone got what they wanted- FiL gets his pension top up with none of the LL responsibilities, BiL gets a cash lump sum and free elderly care for his parents, me and DH get a house that we love and keep in the family, MiL and FiL get their grandkids around the corner from them and family to look after them in their old age.\n",

I am welcome to spend my money on doing the renovations the house needs, but there will be no legal protection other than they will not legally kick me out as long as me and DH are married . Once MiL and FiL have both passed, the house will go to BiL and DH. At that point I can buy out BiL and the money I've paid in renovations will not be taken into consideration. And in the meantime I can look after them in their old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't react well to this and this is where I could be the asshole.

We'll be about 40mins away from them- not too far away, but  not close enough to look after their daily needs in their old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now everyone is upset and apparently it's all my fault. I admit I could have handled it better, but how could they think that me paying them rent for 20 years, renovating the house and then handing over at least £200,000 to BiL when I am in my 60s was even financially possible?

      "Title: AITA for not letting my step son’s dog stay with us?\n",
      "Body text: My 13 year old step son’s mother bought him a puppy over the weekend. Awesome! It was our weekend with our son when they picked him up and he asked if he could bring him over to our house for his younger siblings to meet him. We said OK but only for a bit outside because I am mildly allergic.  In addition, we don’t want to be responsible for an animal with our hectic lives. After the puppy left, my step son said he will need to bring the dog over when his mom is “too busy” to watch him because the dog is his responsibility. I said we won’t be able to do that and explained why for the reasons above. I thought it was settled. Today, during her parenting time, she dropped him off because she has a doctor’s appointment and can’t watch him. I told my husband this is a slippery slope and he needs to tell her she can’t drop off the dog anymore unless she gets direct permission from my husband (but would prefer to not allow it at all) My step son didn’t like that and thinks I’m being unreasonable. As a side note- my husband and his ex-wife don’t have an amicable relationship.\n",

      "Body text: I (M36) and my partner (M35) have been together for 12 years and have had lots of holidays, some as just a pair, other times as a family. Most recently, we've had 4 consecutive holidays with his family where we visited their desired location, did their desired activities and I didn't get any real say on any element of anything we did.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common theme in the family holidays is looking around tourist-tat shops, charity shops, sitting around eating greggs sausage rolls, incense and crystal shops etc. or sitting in a pub or on a beach. I appreciate the pubs, but I don't like the beach and will spend most of my time on holiday stood outside a shop staring into the middle distance.\n",

      "This weekend just gone I arranged for us both to go away to Portsmouth, I don't know what he had expected, but I had made plans to go to visit HMS Victory, see the Mary Rose museum and a few local sites and spend the evening drinking and relaxing. Immediately after we arrived (we were there one night) I said we needed to get a wriggle on and go to where I wanted to visit and was told \"it would be nice to find some souvenirs\" which I dismissed straight away and made a direct route to the museums(the intention of the holiday) and after visiting them, we had to wander around looking for tourist tat shops because he had promised his mum something with \"Portsmouth\" printed on it. Turns out, the shops were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that evening we were having a drink and I was told the following day we had to \"find a shop selling fridge magnets for my mum\", I pulled up a Portsmouth fridge magnet on amazon and said we can just buy that and save 45 minutes of faffing around. I then said \"this isn't a Smith holiday, it's an us holiday\"(pretend Smith is his family name) and he got very offended. I explained how all previous family holidays I spend 90% of my time being dragged to tourist shops and would like a weekend away without that and he claimed I was being an arsehole and unappreciative as his family \"always do what you want to do\". I mentioned a time when we visited Cornwall and I wasn't allowed to visit the Eden project and he replied \"who the fuck wants to go there?\"\n",

      "Body text: Me and my husband Shane share a large home near a beach - we initially bought it thinking we were going to have kids but ended up deciding against it so since we have multiple spare bedrooms and it's near the beach, I let my siblings and their kids use the house as a holiday house for when they go on holidays. Recently my brother Tim and his 3 kids (Bessy, who is 9, Jimmy, who is 11, and Timson, who is 13) spent the weekend here while Tim's wife was working and my husband and I were going camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of recently, Jimmy has had a bit of an interest in money. He celebrated his 11th birthday last month and did not hesitate to show everyone in the family his \"savings\" which he accumulated from pocket money and his birthday money. I did not realise that his interest in money extended to my coin collection which I keep in one of the spare rooms, and when we got home on Sunday, I found Jimmy and Bessy playing shopkeeper with some of my previously uncirculated shillings. Jimmy bragged about the fact that he \"found\" my shillings, but he stopped when I told him those were rare coins and that they were actually my belongings and not his to keep. \n",
      "\n",
      "He gave me the shillings back, and upon inspection I realised he had **polished them.** I asked him what he did and he said he accidentally touched them after eating without washing his hands but it was okay because he brushed them clean with soap and water. At this point I got a bit cross and tried to explain that his polishing of my rare coins made their value plummet but Tim stepped in to defend Jimmy saying \"You can't get too mad at him, he's only 11 and he just loves money. Surely the coins can be restored.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I was really not happy about this and explained to Tim that Jimmy removed about £200 from the value of my coin collection by doing this, and he started to get mad at me and asked whether I cared more about my coin collection or my nephew. I was not going to be berated in my own home and so I told Tim and his kids they had to vacate the house early and I was going to need an apology letter from Jimmy before I would feel comfortable having him as a house guest again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After they left, Shane and I searched through the coin collection to make sure no other coins were vandalised and we found that a gold sovereign was missing from the collection. I called Tim and he told me that Jimmy, Bessy, and Timson were playing with it at the beach but it got lost. At this point I am furious because that coin was worth a lot of money and I said that Tim would have to replace the coins that his kids either lost or vandalised before they would be welcome in my home again. Tim told me that he didn't have the money to do that because he needed that money to buy Jimmy a new phone and I said that I didn't care and I would report it as theft if the coins were not replaced.\n",

On his days off, he usually says “wow I need to mow the lawn” and never ends up mowing it. Eventually he says he can’t do it anymore because it’s too late in the day and might disturb the neighbors. He also says it’s because sticks need to be picked up first and the leaves from the fall need to be removed.

      "I (30M) was house-sitting for my friend (Tom, 32M) for a few days while he and his girlfriend were out of town visiting her family. It wasn’t a huge deal — I’ve done it before. I was feeding his cat, watering his plants, bringing in his mail. He told me I could crash there if I wanted and to “help myself” to whatever.\n",

Of course, I didn’t pack my own clippers, and I didn’t want to leave it — so I figured I’d just borrow his. Not a huge deal, right? I’ve known the guy for 10 years. We’ve literally shared food and beers and stuff. It’s not like I used his toothbrush.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I found the clippers in his bathroom drawer, used them once (just on my thumb, not like I went on a foot-trimming spree), ran them under hot water, wiped them off, and put them back where I thought they went.\n",

      "Turns out his girlfriend noticed they weren’t where she left them (???) and asked if he used them. He hadn’t.

      "So now I’m weirdly trapped in this lie he made up, even though I offered to tell her myself. I get that I didn’t ask first, but I genuinely didn’t think nail clippers were that personal.

I don’t really think I’ll ever go to Japan, though, it’s not really my thing.” My friend kind scoffed and asked why it isn’t “my thing”. I talked about how I don’t speak the language, have no connection to the culture, look white and don’t fit in Japanese spaces, and am not necessarily interested in learning more. They said that I was being racist and invalidating the biracial experience by “white washing” myself and valuing whiteness over “my culture”.\n",

It’s had no bearing on my life, I feel likes it’s more problematic for me to suddenly start calling myself Japanese to anyone and everyone. Probably some internalized issue there but I didn’t think it was such a big deal. Any feedback appreciated. \n",

That’s where the dog goes to the bathroom when my friend’s at work—no pee pads, no fake grass, just a cage tray full of old pee and poop everywhere. The smell hit me as soon as I opened the door. And that same dog runs back inside, jumps on the couch, and sleeps on the bed.\n",

      "She’s even mentioned before that the dog gets period blood on the couch. It’s disgusting—I haven’t sat comfortably since I got here. I had to lint-roll the bed before lying down, and even then I couldn’t sleep because the dog kept jumping in and out with its gross toys. She doesn’t have a feeding schedule for the dog—it eats whatever it wants, including hot Cheetos, and drags food all over the place.\n",

We went to McDonald’s, and I was planning to pay for her, but when we got to the counter, she said something like “Oh, I can pay for myself.” I wasn’t sure if she was just trying to be independent or polite, so I said “Oh okay,” and then (this is the part I may have messed up) I said “Do you just wanna Apple Pay me then?” since I thought she was still letting me cover it.\n",

      "Nothing prepares you for the grief you feel when you discover your intuition was right all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 2 years, my son (16) has been shifting away from me. This is more than your typical teenage moody angst. It was like he hated me with every fiber of his being. He would go to his dad’s for his every other weekend visit and return to my home with seething anger. It worsened with time and by last fall, he became physically intimidating towards his sisters and me to the point I had to call the police. Dad refused to discuss anything with me and I had this unsettling feeling that there was a plot developing. By December, my son caused so much upheaval in my home I finally relented to his demands to go live with dad. I have plenty of reasons why I’ve been against the idea of my son living with his dad but that’s for another time. Within a month of my son going to dad’s and without a single conversation between dad and me about the situation per his choice, dad had me served for full custody of my son only- not his sisters. Dad fabricated a 27 reason argument why he is a better fit to have full custody and I agreed without contest because of the pure hell my son put his sisters and me through. I asked and was awarded a temporary order only with a stipulation to reconvene in 30 days after my son attend therapy, which dad was vehemently opposed to prior to court. With therapy ordered and taking the advice of my lawyer, I began nurturing the broken relationship between my son and I. It took months of cautious interactions beginning with just a few hours and gradually working our way up to longer periods of time. The stipulated order was extended another month and a half in order to allow additional time for my son to meet with his therapist on a regular basis. Then, suddenly, it all changed. My son completely reverted back to a version I hadn’t seen in nearly 2 years and the complaints about dad came at an overwhelming pace. I knew something had been off for the last couple years and my gut told me what I knew instinctively and it was confirmed last night when my son explained the scheme dad and he calculated in order for dad to take custody. Even down to setting me up for extreme reactions to my son’s bad behavior so they could claim my home was full of conflict. What my son doesn’t know is this all came on the heels of a 14 month long child support review where his dad did everything you can imagine to reduce his child support obligation (he’s a 1099 iykyk) but I hired a CPA investigator to minimize the impact of his lies. Now his dad and him are at odds. The mama bear in me wants to rescue my son and bring him home but the betrayal and effects of what my son has done is so deep that I don’t think I can ever trust him enough to let him come home. And while I knew in my soul what was happening, it was the hope that I was wrong that kept me going. \n",

      "Body text: Okay so to preface this two days before Mothers Day, our house was broken into. We tried to install cameras but realized the cameras we ordered wouldn’t work. \n",
      "Anyway my husband decided that weekend he wanted to go for a bike ride with a group of buddies on Sunday (Mother’s Day). He left around 12pm. I spent the afternoon and early evening with my mother and my family. Everything was going fine with occasional updates on his day. After supper that night I had headed home around 7pm, and I realized the power was out. Odd but sometimes that happens. I thought maybe he forgot to pay the bill (we’ve had issues in the past with our electric company) so I messaged him asking if he may have forgotten. He claimed he hadn’t. Come to find out some breaker blew for the whole block. I didn’t know it at the time since we live next to two abandoned homes and a school. Anyway it was starting to get really dark and as a woman in her early 20s I was starting to get uncomfortable staying at home alone at night with no power after our home was just broken into. I called my husband and asked if he would be willing to start heading home. He said no and I could handle myself. No worries…so I offered to pack up our animals and head back to my mothers. He flipped out at that suggestion calling me an idiot for wanting to leave our home unprotected after a break in calling me a pu**y. He told me he wasn’t coming home and I needed to figure it out but I wasn’t allowed to leave the house unprotected. He hung up and I called the electric company again and asked for an ETA. They said it would be later that night before anyone came out and suggested I find somewhere to stay and that I would get a phone call when the technician was there. So I called my husband again to give him the update and asked again if he would be willing to head home in about 30 minutes. I asked if we could maybe compromise and he lost it on me. Told me i was a pos for acting a fool and that he didn’t deserve me as a wife. He claimed he deserved better and he shouldn’t have to cut his 8 hour bike ride short and that he will come home when he’s ready. He hung up on me. I panicked and called my brother who ended up coming to stay with me until the power came back on. After my husband came home he looked right at me and said all I do is ruin his life and he was pretty much done with me after this. We ended up talking things out but He’s about to go out again this weekend and keeps telling me I better not ruin this one for him and to call someone else if something happens cause he will be busy. I don’t plan to….but AITA?\n",

I said so you want me to report on 2 other adults plans? She said  that if I don't tell her everything, she doesn't feel like it's necessary to talk to me often. It came off as controlling. She has her daughter's gps location, it's not like we were being sneaky or bad or anything.

He gave me little to no reason other than the fact that \"Life was calling him elsewhere\", and I have genuinely never been so heartbroken in my life. I thought he was the love of my life, and he called off our wedding in a parking lot after we'd just been shopping for napkins for the ceremony. He was dating a new girl only four months later, and I felt incredibly betrayed. \n",

      "I had moved to LA to be near him, and ended up staying there for only around a month after our break up, generally being depressed and lonely and heartsick. A little less than a year ago I moved to Denver, and there I happened to run across my ex (24m). We'd dated long distance from senior year of high school to my freshman year of college, and we ended up breaking up due to the distance. Neither of us knew the other had moved to Denver, or even Colorado as a whole, and after being friends for a while, two months ago we started dating. It has been the most amazing and healing relationship for me, in a way that makes me thankful for all the heartbreak of the past years because it led me back to him. \n",

      "I don't understand this, like at all. I never once saw or spoke to my current boyfriend after we broke up, in fact when I'd met my ex fiancé I hadn't seen or heard from him in around two and a half years.

I love my boyfriend so so much, and I feel like this realtionship, even though still very young, has showed me what a truly loving a caring partner is, but I can't help but feel guilty. \n",

I (27F) love my nephew (10M) very much. He's a very intelligent, kind, and sweet kid. He also has very unique interests for a boy his age, and his father (38M) disapproves of most of them. He's a good father, but he isn't very supportive of his son (we'll call him Andy). For example, Andy likes to crochet with me, but my brother Jared has told me privately to do other activities with Andy. But, he has never expressed his disapproval directly towards Andy. \n",

I've been bonding more and more with Andy and learning more about his interests. Now, the trouble arose when Andy asked me to enroll him in our local community center's ballet classes. I think it would be a great opportunity for him, and I don't think that ballet is gendered. I did, however, have a sneaking suspicion that Jared would disapprove. I still enrolled Andy in the classes for the summer, and he is overjoyed. \n",

Andy is really excited about the classes, and I don't think he is aware of the conflict it has caused between his father and I. The classes are free, so Jared is not mad about the money, but I still feel like I have been duplicitous towards my own brother. \n",

      "Body text: For things to make sense, I need to give you some backstory: I (18F) have a close friend—let’s call her Alice (also 18F). Our houses are side by side, and we’ve known each other for over 5 years. We’re both in our last year of high school and currently getting ready for the university entrance exams. We often have study dates at each other’s houses. Alice is super kind-hearted, but she can be kind of oblivious to the situations around her—just a very naive person overall. Alice’s family is going through a rough time right now. A couple of months ago, her dad suddenly left them for another woman. He moved out and started divorce proceedings, leaving Alice, her 14-year-old sister, and their stay-at-home mom in a really tough spot—both emotionally and financially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mom was a SAHM (stay-at-home mom) since the beginning of her marriage and didn’t have much work experience even before that. She’s also a high school dropout. After her husband left, she had to find a job, and the only thing she managed to get was a minimum wage cleaning job. She works 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, just to make ends meet. Her dad only pays the rent and utilities because it’s court-mandated. Other than that, he doesn’t contribute a cent—no alimony or child support, since the divorce isn’t finalized yet. I’m saying all of this so you understand how badly they’re struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yesterday afternoon, she invited me over to study at her house. When I got there, I saw a big box wrapped in gift paper. I asked her what it was, and she told me she bought her mom a big portable Bluetooth speaker (like the ones used for parties) as a gift to cheer her up.\n",
      "I asked how much it cost, and she said 10,000 (in our local currency, but that’s half of a monthly minimum wage salary). I was honestly shocked and asked where she got the money. She told me she’d been saving up for university since last year, but decided to spend it on the speaker to make her mom happy because her mom loves music. At that point, I didn’t want to upset her, so I changed the subject and we started studying. \n",
      "\n",
      "We studied for a few hours until her mom came home from work—completely exhausted. Alice called her mom over and gave her the gift. When her mom opened it, she looked shocked. She tried to act happy and asked Alice how much it cost. Alice told her, all smiling. Her mom looked horrified and sad, but she didn’t say anything. She just hugged Alice and went to her room. After that, I found an excuse to leave. \n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, Alice called and said her mom is really sad and anxious, and she doesn’t know why. She thinks maybe it’s because of the divorce still going on. Now I’m wondering—would I be the asshole if I gently told her that her mom isn’t happy and the gift is probably the reason why, and that maybe she should consider returning it?\n",

      "\n",
      "When he was showing off his newly renovated office and he had a dry-erase board with family photos on it but none of me.

He said more things along the line of us being sheltered and that our mom failed in raising us because we couldn't handle his teasing. He went on and on for like three minutes but it honestly felt like ten. During this my mom had tried to call twice but both me and my sister were frozen just because I could never imagine him doing this. He ended the call by saying that he hopes my sister enjoys college because she need a to be exposed to the real world and grow up.\n",

We were once very close – her, another guy “L”, and I were like a trio during training and moved to the same city to start university. S and I decided to live together in a shared dorm apartment.\n",

      "Everything was okay at first, but recently there’s been a lot of tension between S and L. They’re constantly clashing, and I’ve somehow become the middle person.

I tried to be supportive, but it got to the point where I started having headaches and feeling totally drained every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, L came to me asking if something was wrong, and I told him the truth because I couldn’t keep being the emotional buffer. This obviously made things worse between them. I then suggested we all talk things out. During that conversation, I gently told S that her constant venting was overwhelming me – and she was shocked, like I had betrayed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also keeps telling me I don’t stand up for her enough – especially toward L – and that it hurts her that I don’t speak my mind more. The truth is, I *don’t like conflict*. I’ve explained this to her and shared that I avoid confrontation because of things from my past. She said she understands, but still expects more from me, and I now feel super guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, on L’s advice, I asked for a single room in the same student housing complex – and I got it. I’ve already signed the lease and given notice for our current apartment. S has no idea I’m moving out. I haven’t told her yet because I know she’ll take it very personally and spiral. She already thinks I’m distancing myself emotionally, and this would feel like the final blow.\n",

      "Body text: Today my partner and I went hiking with our friend to a state park in Indiana called “Turkey Run State. We’ve never had any issues with people here until we dined in at the restaurant at the park. I want to clarify that we are all 20. We were all raised in indiana although I was raised with a different culture so I am not familiar with the norm. I am not a social person but i do my best to be kind. We go to restaurants somewhat often and the waiters we have are usually kind and friendly so we leave tips around 15%-20% because their service was exceptional. However, once we were sat down the waiter seemed okay. Once we decided what we wanted to eat, we waited the normal amount of time it takes for the waiter to return. As soon as she returned, she asked for orders and I began with a steak burger and asked if the house chips were french fries or chips like lays. before i could finish she interrupted with “nope, french fries are french fries and house chips are house chips.” i was trying to explain that I have know restaurants sometimes refer to french fries as chips so wanted to be sure but she did not give me the chance to finish. After that she began to take the rest of our orders in a manner as if she did not want to be serving us. then again we are all not social but try to be kind. after that, my friend says thank you after they refilled their water and they respond with you’re welcome nothing odd but once i said thank you, no response. I tried thanking them again after they returned and again no response. Meanwhile an elderly couple and family walk in, order and get their order before us. she walks by our table saying “your food will be out soon guys the chicken takes less time then what you ordered” my partner and friend both ordered chicken as well. After waiting 30 minutes our food arrives, we thank them and no response other than “enjoy your food”. We did not enjoy the food. it had tasted as if it had been sitting for a while, my partner and friend can confirm it was because they both worked at a local business with a grill. the bread had become soggy from sitting as well as the meat had become dry. we finish our food and decided not to tip because of what we believed was poor service and the waiter looks at us and says in a loud voice while pointing at the receipt “you guys don’t want to tip?” and we say “no thanks”. as we are preparing to leave she slams my card down on the table even though i reached for it. she walked away and in a disapproving tone says “have good day thanks for eating here”. i’m not sure if we did anything wrong since it was not busy or late. we all work in food service so we have a good understanding of how stressful things get but we’re sure that we were kind throughout the time there so we don’t understand why we were treated so poorly.

      "Then, in March, she started a rumor that I was dating my mentor (23M). It was because he offered to drive me to a store that is out of walking distance to get something specific I needed for a project, and we ran into her. It was an act of kindness as he had a car, and he needed something from the same store anyways. The act of driving me to the store was fine, but the rumor caused a TON of issues and ended with me having to switch mentors and him having to prove his innocence to a research ethics board who also deemed the situation completely acceptable. The new mentor I work for is also very nice, but the scope of our work is very far out of what I originally wanted to do and I’m upset that I’m not learning what I’d like to because my roommate decided to tell everyone we were dating. I know she started the rumor because I know she has an affinity for gossip but also because she was behind us in the aisles giggling to her boyfriend and other people told me that they heard these rumors from her. \n",

Someone thought it was okay to spread a rumor that we were dating so I had to get switched into a different group and he almost got put on academic probation. I’m really upset that someone would say stuff like that and try to ruin his career and force me to work in a different group; I’m sure you get it after all those rumors spread about you.” I didn’t say it in an accusatory manner, I played dumb. However, I heard her crying to her boyfriend about feeling bad about something and our other roommate (who is aware I know about who started the rumors) told me I was an asshole and petty for pretending like I didn’t know who started it all to guilt trip her instead of outright confronting her like an adult.\n",

      "I (20F) and my sister (17F) are very close, largely because we bonded over how controlling and inconsistent our parents were. They enforced senseless rules just because they could, while maintaining the illusion that everything was normal. When I was 14, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a tight-knit friend group that felt like a second family. I loved and trusted them deeply, but midway through senior year, they suddenly cut me off and spread rumors about me. Why? Because my parents tracked my phone, and my mom told one of their moms about us going somewhere without permission. They thought I was the snitch. That incident defined the rest of senior year—I had to rebuild my identity and learn to be independent. It also meant no senior trip for me because I had no one to go with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing up, our parents made us believe we were broke, even though we were middle class. They spent our college tuition on renovating the kitchen and living room. I became extremely frugal, working as a minor to pay for my clothes, food, and essentials. Now, I’m in a good college for digital art and animation. I pay my own tuition, rent, and gas. My parents cover my phone bill and car insurance.\n",

      "Meanwhile, I noticed my mom buying my sister expensive clothes that filled her closet. When I asked why she didn’t do the same for me, my mom said she “doesn’t like my style.” So I used their card to buy some clothes I needed and got scolded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came my sister’s birthday. They took her and two friends to the beach. For mine, I got a cake and a book. I didn’t complain. But now they’re planning her senior trip: $1,800 for her, and $3,200 each for my parents to join her in the Bahamas. I’m stunned. I’m barely making rent and living like a broke student. Even when I had a senior trip planned (before the friend fallout), it was going to be max $500—just for me, not them.\n",

As well as a quote from my friend, just above in a different font and colour, joking about how the place we hung out had a lot of people vaping nearby. When I sent her the video thinking she'd be impressed by the nostalgia or at least the photos and song choices, she got upset with me over the fact that the words which she called stupid and mean- even though they weren't anything to do with her- were still on the poster.\n",

It was only after she dismissed the apologies and muted our chat (as she does whenever she needs space) that I re watched the video. Not that I didn't watch it many times before hand. I looked carefully at the group photos and, she was in the centre of every one she was in. I DID crop some photos because I wanted to remove someone who's no longer considered a friend of the group, but she was no where near the area cropped.

      " \n",
      "Ever since 2025 started, I've been feeling a shift in our relationship. We don't really talk anymore, we just respond to each other's messages. It takes way longer to have a conversation, and it's not really a conversation at all. I mentioned to her that I don't feel that important in her life, but she reassured me that I'm her \"bestest friend\" and that everyone else around her sucks. I tried to brush it off as just me being paranoid, but the feelings persisted. I understand that both her and I are busy with college and our personal life’s, but she’s simply not that busy, she’s just doesn’t want to be involved with me if it doesn’t necessarily benefits her.\n",

      "Around the same time, she told me she feels like she has executive dysfunction. As her best friend, I felt guilty about how “selfish” i’ve been for being upset that she’s barely talking to me, and I immediately jumped into helping her figure out ways to manage it. I even talked to people who suffered from the same thing, and someone suggested that picking up the same shows or hobbies might help us interact better. Because of that, I started watching her most liked show at the moment, Arcane. However, even after we started doing that, the same issues persisted, slow replies and a lack of interest. I assumed she was going through a tough time mentally, so I tried to be patient.\n",

In April, I saw that she was going out more, which wasn't necessarily a problem, but it seemed inconsistent with what she'd told me just a few weeks earlier, she didn't want to hang out because she didn't feel like going out. Then, my birthday came and she didn't even wish me a happy birthday. I’ve dealt with bad social anxiety for the past few years, because of that I forgot a lot of small details. I understand going through a rough time with mental health can make you forget more than usual, but If I felt like I might’ve forgotten her birthday, I would’ve wrote it down, or at least make an attempt to make sure I wouldn’t forget. Because of that, this was the final straw for me. I always feel like i’m making attempts to be an amazing friend to her, and she can’t even try to wish me a happy birthday? I stopped responding to her TikToks and text messages, I just didn't have the energy to want to talk to her.\n",

This wasn’t the first time that I asked for it back, I’d wager it was in late November 2024. The recurrent theme in our arguments is that I had not actually “lent” this jacket, but rather that I had “gifted” it, and she has since repeated that there were witnesses that day that heard me say so. While I trust my memory, at this rate I’m willing to believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked for the jacket back the first time due to my struggles with money then, and since that jacket was quite expensive, I thought to sell it. This is when she first said she was “pretty confident” it was a gift. She empathised with me though, and said that once she went back to town where she left it, she would be giving it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flashforward, I’m still not that better off money-wise, but I asked for an update on the jacket, after I remembered how dear it was to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shift in her demeanor. She said she would be keeping it, that it was really rude to ask for a gift back, and that she wouldn’t allow me to “gaslight her again”. I was offended, and accused her of having bad manners. That I was asking back for it because it was something that mattered to me. I regretted being rude and tried to reel it back, settling for telling her that she could keep it, but that she shouldn’t judge me over this. She argued further, said it was awful manners to ask for a gift back, and that if it mattered so much, that I shouldn’t have gifted it. Ominously, she added she “was already judgmental of me for a long time”. I relied on my memory, insisting I hadn’t gifted it to her, only that I might’ve said I used it little. She repeated there were witnesses hearing me say I did, refused to speak to me further through text, and wished me good luck on our test that afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that day, I saw her outside talking to friends. I stood nearby for a while, hoping she’d approach me. I didn’t want to bring this up publicly. After twenty or so minutes, I left. I sent her another message, looking back on her strange text, and said quite bitterly that if she disliked me so much, that I would gladly help her get rid of the jacket. Getting this item back was now a matter of dignity, and about not allowing myself to be treated harshly. Going up the steps to my house, I saw a myriad of texts.\n",

      "“Why did you just stand there looking like an idiot?” “You are a gaslighter” “You have done awful things to both me and the people I love, and I don’t want someone like you near me” “You never look me in the eyes” “Your lack of care leaves a lot to wish for” “This jacket is my property, and now I’d rather burn it”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a meltdown then and there. I sent her some teary messages asking to be told about these things I had done that had hurt people. So far, no answer. I was too emotional, and assuming I gifted this item, I was wrong to do it without thinking it twice. This still feels rather unfair.\n",

It was a long sappy post about how proud I was of him for graduating even though he faced many challenges. I did not disclose that these issues were with his family and financial situation but I did mention in the post that he had to move twice during senior year (The first time when him and his dad were kicked out of his dad’s friend‘s house, the second when me and my boyfriend moved into our apartment.) I did not mention the reason for why he had to move, but that he while being in high school had to pay bills (he had to help his dad with bills bad gas sometimes, and then once they moved my boyfriend was responsible for the internet bill.) there were other things I included but essentially I talked about how he was a good example of succeeding despite challenges and about how he’s a great partner, you know all that sort of ramble.\n",

I asked my boyfriend if he wanted me to delete the post but he said no because he said he liked it and that it came from the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really conflicted because my boyfriend’s dad has messaged him about being upset about the post. His dad is also upset because he thinks my boyfriend‘s mom will use the post against him. My boyfriend‘s parents are divorced and due to his mom having more kids than she can care for financially and having a bad living situation, he moved in with his dad once he became sober. My boyfriends dad has never really bought groceries so my boyfriend has always bought them for himself and when his mom knew she turned it into an argument, and other situations like that have happened before. I think my boyfriends dad is worried she won’t let him see my boyfriends younger brother (he has many but only 1 is his dad’s) My boyfriend told his dad that he took the post in the wrong way and that if his mom texts his dad to tell him and he’ll handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my mind I feel like I’m not in the wrong because I didn’t mention his dad at all and it wasn’t meant be slander. Yes, my boyfriend had to help with bills and such as a minor due to his dads poor decisions, criminal record and no college degree leading him to struggle to find a good paying job but I didn’t mention any of that only that my boyfriend had bigger financial responsibilities as a high schooler than most and it had a very large mental impact on him and made his life harder yet he still did his best. On the other hand  I don’t want to cause him trouble with his ex wife and seeing his other child. Me and his dad have always got along great, and I feel really bad I’ve upset him.\n",

      "Edit: Here are some pieces of info I forgot to add, might help with context a bit since I’ve had a few people ask for clarification. His dad was a very well known drug addict and drug dealer in our county. He went to prison and now is not in prison but the charges prevent him from a lot. He has no custody if his kids and there’s no custody battle occurring. nothing legal. when my boyfriend moved in with him he told his mom to drop the child support so there’s none of that, definitely would not say anything publicly if there was legal stuff involved. little update as well: boyfriend texted his dad to explain and things seem to be worked out after my boyfriend explained he may have misinterpreted and taken it personally. I asked my boyfriend if I should tweak or delete but he insisted he likes it as it is, however if his dad requests that I do I’ll oblige since even changing the wording would still keep the same message.\n",

An important detail is that Jay is moving away after the summer and won’t be here, and she considers me her closest friend and I don’t think the whole group going on a trip and excluding her, including her best friend, would be a good last memory to have of your home before moving and I don’t think it would be fair either.

      "From his perspective: I’m choosing the side of his ex instead of him, when he’s always chosen my side in friendship breakups, etc., as well as, I’m putting him in an uncomfortable situation where he has to be around his ex and be doesn’t like her.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my perspective: It’s my house too and it’s a group thing we planned beforehand. I would’ve cut her off if she was doing something wrong to him or being an asshole but from what I got the whole reason they broke up was because he wasn’t attracted to her anymore and it just became really toxic from there and they were better off as friends. I didn’t know that me being around her bothered him but in my eyes I don’t think it’s fair to exclude her just because he doesn’t like her anymore and the group is big enough to the point where they don’t have to directly talk to each other in the span of a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still told him it was a group thing and that I wouldn’t be un-inviting her, but now I’m having second thoughts and I think I might be the asshole because he is my brother after all and I should stand by him. So, am I the asshole?\n",

      "No one really wants to go on that horse trip except for mom, my dad (52m) broke a collarbone recently and my gf (21f) broke a rib recently too, neither of them can ride because of it so they would just be staying at the place we'll be sleeping at and then join everybody for the dinner and chat afterwards. My brother (25m) has barely gotten any vacation for 1½ years now and finally has a week vacation and really just wants to use it to relax and not do much, I (19m) don't really want to go because i just came back from another trip and i'll start working a lot soon and i want to use that time to spend time with my girlfriend or just relax. \n",

I ended up transferring schools due to having low credits, and I met this guy named \"S\"(18M) after a couple of months. We got close pretty fast, and one day I finally told \"M\" about \"S\", and they got super mad that I had never introduced them. They ended up not talking to me for a week. We always got in petty fights and most of the time it was them getting mad at me over for example, wanting to go to chili's over applebees (yes an actual reason they got mad at me).\n",

I told them to just tell him straight up but i was sort of iffy on the idea of them dating (i knew they wouldn't end up dating for long and was gonna end on a bad note) I explained to \"M\" that i would support them if they chose to date \"S\" or not. \"M\" was the type of person that after they broke up with someone they found every reason to make them look like a bad person (even if they weren't). After about 7 months that \"S\" and \"M\" were dating, \"M\" came to me AGAIN for advice on how to breakup with \"S\" because \"he was too poor for them to date\" EXACT QUOTES.. And i understand wanting to go on dates BUT HE DID TAKE \"M\" ON DATES. just not dinner dates and spending lots of money. He would take them on hikes, picnics, go up into the canyons, lakes. After the whole conversation I told them straight up \"im not gonna choose between you guys if you stop being friends with \"S\".\" they once again got upset with me. (this is where i might be an asshole) A couple days later Me and \"S\" hung out. We went out to eat along with some shopping I posted about it on my instagram with a picture of me and \"S\". NOT KIDDING 2 MINUTES LATER i get a huge paragraph from \"M\" saying im so shitty and rubbing it in their face that me and \"S\" were still friends after i \"PROMISED\" that i would always stay on \"M\" side (I NEVER SAID THAT). \n",

Even when I’m wearing headphones (sometimes even my Bluetooth earmuffs to really make a point) he’ll just keep asking me inane questions, not listen to the answers, and carry on with an entirely one sided conversation.

It’s very possible that I would have ignored our rule for someone else.\n",

She had another random fella here and they were so loud on a week night, I was already annoyed and was even more so when it turned out they were drinking some really expensive whisky that my sister had got me for my birthday. So yeah… let’s go with no more alcohol allowed in the house.\n",

Every other person she’s had here has been fine with it and she hasn’t kicked up a stink before now but she has occasionally brought drinks home with her and I’ve made her get rid of them. She got upset with me once and wrecked a 3000pc puzzle I was working on but it might have been less about the drinks and more about me not letting her have my car keys.\n",

      "I might also be being an AH because she won’t pay for power and leaving the lights on all night and won’t get firewood in so I’m refusing to light the fire when she’s home and turning the light fuses off when I go to bed. I realise that there is a lot that makes her an AH but this sort of petty stuff that I’m doing might mean that I’m also an AH? Also an awful lot of the stuff she’s doing is related to her poor mental health so my behaviour might not be super helpful?\n",

I really hate the idea of leaving cari to fend for herself and do not know how to tell her i just dont see how i can afford this much more. I have mentioned to cari that we should start looking at single rooms and she said she would rather pay more to live with us as she does not want to live with strangers. It is pretty easy to find single rooms where we live, but has been more challenging to find a home.

      "Body text: I (55F) am a paraplegic. I spend nearly every hour of every day sitting and sleeping on a couch because my bedroom is upstairs. So, I'm stuck in a small spare room that's too small to even fit a bed in. I have a table in the room that has a couple of shelves under it. The table has two tops, one of which swings out to form an L-shape that can be used as a desk. This part of the table goes in front of me, parallel to the couch, while the other part of the table (the part with the shelves) stays to my left, perpendicular to the couch. This table is perfect for me because whenever I need to get up, I can simply push it to the side to move it out of the way. On the table are my laptop on the right half, with a large pen rack, two juice glasses, some papers, and a few small knick-knacks on the left. There is a small shelving unit behind the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here is my conflict: my husband (53M) was in my room helping me get situated back on the couch after a trip to the bathroom. Per usual, he filled both juice glasses to the top. Then, when he went to swing the table in front of me, the pen rack bumped into the shelving. This happens periodically, and I just slide the pen rack a couple of inches away from the shelving. I think swinging the tabletop causes vibrations that make the pen rack gradually move towards the shelves. My desk table is very small (narrower than my laptop), and my pen rack is kinda large, which I need so I can store all kinds of small items that I use frequently within reach (e.g., markers, scissors, magnifier, tape, stapler, lip gloss, etc., not just pens), as it's not like I can get up off the couch and go get what I need. Anyway, when the pen rack bumped into the shelving, instead of sliding the pen holder away from it like I always do, he moved the table a few inches away from the shelving. In doing so, one of the square metal legs of the table slammed into my kneecap and remained pressed against it. I have feeling in that knee, so it really hurt. I told my husband what happened and told him the table could not stay there because it would be painful for me to have a square metal table leg constantly pressing against my knee. He got angry and slammed the table back to where it was, and when it hit against the shelving, the juice sloshed out of both completely full glasses and went everywhere. Because it was sticky cranberry juice, I couldn't just mop up the mess with paper towels; I had to wash everything down with soapy wipes. There were a ton of items to clean, so it took a long time. My papers were ruined because the ink sort of melted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Btw, he did not help me clean up the juice, nor did he offer to. He just stood there watching me cry and clean. He also did not apologize for hurting my knee or spilling my juice everywhere. My husband spends approximately 15-20 minutes per day in my room.\n",

So naturally I forgotten about them. He went through and read them all. He now believes I want my ex back because of those letters (i dont, my ex is vile). I've already apologised the hardest I can. I got rid of them after our fight, I made sure to go through my whole closet making sure I didn't have anything else. I'll admit I shouldn't of kept them, but they were in my closet under clothes.

Anyway, we exchanged pictures and stuff only for 6 hours later, us to break up. Thats fine, whatever. Idrc. So a little bit later, i get a discord dm. From my ex (not skyl. another ex.) that basically says \"i know you downloaded the pics and vids skyl sent you.\" and in my mind, im going \"what the fuck. i did not.\" so i tell them that. Get blocked immedently. ofc. So i just play it off and go play some games for a bit. later i check bluesky and i see all kinds of posts calling me out as some predator and catfisher. So, what i do is i put up that theyre all lying. Post gets taken down bc of \"harassment\" Ok, whatever bluesky. Idc. So then i take it to my wall of shame channel in my discord server. people agree with me, skyl and bluesky are in the wrong. Wtv. for a little bit more context, we're all 16. later that night i get invited to a group dm. no biggie, love a groupchat with friends. i mean what girl wouldnt lol. next message is, \"how are you this evening, \\[deadname\\] the predator\". Then i get threatening messages from these people about hacking my accounts, murdering me, etc.  This morning, i wake up to 8 notifs. 2 from discord (from my frens telling me good morning) and 6 from bluesky, all of them supporting skyl and their bullshit. naturally, i go and call it out in multiple posts. this time they dont get taken down but rather skyl fires back with \"This is defamtion and slander. Stop this now or there'll be legal action.\" I keep going. Finally skyl messages me and bro says \"What the hell is wrong with you. why are you doing this.\" My thought is, yall called me a predator, white diddy, and claimed i catfished you, leaked my nudes, and plastered my selfie everywhere with predator over my head. Dont even start. Im trans, mtf, and im unable to transistion (which means, i look like a guy still) so the catfishing thing i get even though i made very clear im not currently transistioning. \n",

We met over the weekend and talked about it again..this time though he said that one of his friends wanted to go for drinks with him but he was okay tagging me along. Yesterday however..the said friend initiated plans with the whole friend group and they're to meet up for drinks and dinner on the Saturday before his birthday. I feel overlooked seeing as we'd agreed well spend the weekend together way before they made their plans.He now wants to split the time...Saturday for them Sunday for me..this is not the first time our plans have been adjusted by him to accommodate plans made by his friends after he'd committed to plans with me. On a few occasions  when we've had to split time..the friends ended up coming up with new plans and he agreed to them without communication to me and never showed up for plans with me at the time he promised to come to me and now I'm afraid if he goes out with them Saturday night they'll convince him to spend majority of Sunday with them and I won't have any time with my boyfriend on his birthday.

He usually ignores my messages for hours daily, comes online and answers to others but still not to me. Now he doesn't even come online anymore because of my yapping about him changing. 8th of March was woman's day in my country. I got nothing from him, not even a flower. (it's a tradition that close men in your life buy you flowers) Mind you a rose is like 2$ in my country. We were betting about something few times and he lost and he promised to give me his hoodie and a necklace. He didn't do it despite me telling him for weeks how much it means to me. Plus I'm wearing necklace that my ex gave me and he is yapping about it but never got me another one to wear. He said all of his hoodies mean too much to him and they hold memories. And I'm like okay, go to second hand, buy one(its like 5$), wear it and put your perfume on it. About necklaces I'm not asking for anything expensive. Stainless steel ones cost like 4$. He knows all of this and despite it all I still haven't gotten anything. He has a good salary and it's not like he can't afford it. And when we go out he pays mostly because his salary is way bigger than mine. I pay like 40% of the time and he 60%.His bday is this week on Sunday and I planned to take him to massage, bake him a cake, plus buy a bunch of presents that I know he will like. All of it would cost me 100$-150$. People around me told me to not do it. I plan on not buying him anything in the end. So WIBTA if I don't buy him anything and how should I react to it? \n",

Yes this is where i could be the asshole but I decided after the biggest anxiety attack, I’ve had enough and I quit, even tho we pay $1425 in rent every month. He told me to do whatever I wanted and that’s what I wanted to do. I have two interviews tomorrow for two jobs that pay higher and give me a lot more hours. Here’s the problem, my boyfriend got really upset I quit (which is understandable) and thinks he’s gonna have to pay all these bills alone. I ended up texting my boss sort of apologizing for this morning and to give me a couple days to see if I want to come back. She said that is completely fine and that she’ll be waiting for my answer. Even knowing that no matter what I have a job secured he is still being really mean and doesn’t think I’m gonna get either job. I feel like it’s making me think I made a bad decision and that I have no way to get these jobs. I’m so mentally beat down and unfortunately if it ends up I don’t get these jobs I still have a job to go to. I’ve asked him many times to just have faith in me and he doesn’t respond. It’s also incredibly hypocritical cause he’s done that 2 times to me so that’s what upsets me even more. I know he loves me and wants the best for both of us but I just feel like he doesn’t have any faith in me. So am I the asshole for quitting my miserable job this morning.\n",

She also said things like \"ugh I can't believe it doesn't support airdrop\" (well it actually kind of does for those who don't know) and \"Can it even run Instagram without crashing.\" For elaboration she says flip phone she means a clamshell fold phone (think galaxy z flip) so it's not like I'm running a nokia or something like that.\n",

And then I said you can't even use split screen and only have 6GB of ram and that I have twice as much. Also I said that actually in some benchmarks my phone is better than yours (she has an iPhone 14). After that she looked kind of sad and quiet and said I didn't have to be a jerk about it.

      "Body text: I'm in college, and last year I made a friend, which I thought was a good friend to me. We went to the library and made drawings, we talked about comedies and all of that stuff. In this year at the start of the semester, my friend invited me to her group of friends, which I gladly accepted and entered into the group. However, most of the people in her group were not my cup of tea. It's not that I didn't like them, they just didn't click with me. Also, most of them didn't want to talk with me because, I was practically a stranger to them. This was a more of a me problem, and I wasn't really mad at them because they barely knew me. My problem is that, when in this group, my friend started to talk less and less to me, to the point she only talked with me if I talked to her first. Then, her friends started to interrupt me when I was talking and she said nothing. So I started getting progressively angrier at this situation. I've never been good with confrontation, so I never told her I was mad. My breaking point was a time when she was talking to two of her friends of this group I was supposedly part of. So I came up, said hi. Then they completely ignored me, I was just standing there watching them talk, with them never asking me anything or even looking at me. So I reached a breaking point and left. I found a cat that was with me for the longest time and I posted an instagram story saying the cat is a better companion than most people. She quickly caught on that I was talking about her, asking me if I was mad. I felt bad, beacuse I thought I should've told her before, so I confessed and told her how I felt, I also apologized for not telling her before. After this, she proceeded to completely put the blame on me, saying I was an asshole for not telling her I was mad and that she can't always be talking to me. She then proceeded to tell me she didn't want to be friends anymore. I blocked her and only spoke to her for a college project we were working on.  \n",

      "So, am I the asshole for not telling her I was mad? I know I may have messed up on that, but she reacted as if I was the only guilty one in that situation, completely ignoring the fact that she too had hurt me by casting me aside. I felt really hurt, and today I feel she never saw me as a real friend, but just as a backup for when her real friends weren't there.\n",

I told him to threaten to tell the landlord about the situation and that he needed to man up and get our money back for our family.

My mom and I both agreed that it was very unlikely that the teacher would still be using the same tests, so we assumed it would be a great study tool for knowing the basic concepts, formulas, etc that I would need on the real test. I went in to every test expecting a different version with completely different problems, since every teacher my sister and I have had use different tests every year. For context, I only had a few of her tests—the midterm, a couple chapters, and the final. I sent a picture of one of the tests to my best friend, since I told her I had it and didn’t think it would be a problem. I thought it was just like sharing notes, because surely the tests wouldn’t still be the same. Soon, word got out that I had the tests and the pictures spread around. I know I’m partially in the wrong for using and sharing the tests, but shouldn’t my teacher be changing them? The tests were exactly the same, too—same problems, same numbers—and each time I thought, “Maybe he just keeps the midterms and some tests the same.” A lot of people use their previous tests from the year to study for the final, especially when the teacher tells them the questions from those tests will be on the final.

      "Body text: Hi, I 17F wake my dad 47ishM up on accident pretty frequently, usually because I end up going to bed a few hours later than him and we have two dogs and one of them(we'll say honey) especially likes to whine when she can't get inside. \n",

      "I usually sleep with the dogs because I'm the only one they don't wake up, this is usually the other dog's fault(let's call her poppy), she likes to scratch on the door to sleep with my mom and wakes up in the middle of the night\n",

      "\n",
      "Btw, my dad has been sick for a bit so he wasn't in a great mood. I think either I or honey accidentally woke him up while I was in the bath. When I'm finished with my bath I go get my clothes on and get distracted by a YouTube video and start laughing and so my dad calls me and is mad at me for waking him up and the honey whining and waking him up(I wasn't too loud when I was laughing but he's a light sleeper).\n",
      "\n",
      " I get my headphones and offer for him to use them to not hear as much before I planned to go get the dog, but he yelled at me for not doing what he asked an hour ago(when he said when I was done with my bath if I could take care of the dogs)\n",
      "\n",

      "Of course that wakes my dad up and he takes honey and tells me to grab poppy and we put them in their kennels.

Says how the dogs shouldnt be allowed in the house and I shouldn't either if I can't pull it together and says if he hear a peep from my room. So he starts watching a TV show and I cry quietly in my room and then quietly go outside to sleep outside as to not bother him.\n",

      "\n",
      "I met a guy (Ben) a few weeks ago through a mutual friend and spent the whole day together and he seemed really interested and we hooked up. This past weekend our mutual friend was hosting a party in her hometown on Sunday. I don’t know anyone from the town or anyone else who was going, but they convinced me to attend. I would arrive Friday and leave Sunday after the party. My friend would only get to her hometown on Sunday but Ben said he would be in town the whole week and so would be there Saturday/Sunday so we could meet up while we were there (HIS IDEA). I’ll admit, the idea of seeing him again was probably the main reason I agreed to go to the party in the first place, which in fairness he didn't know. I had texted him twice in the week before the party to try and make a plan, and he just responded with vague “yeah we’ll work something out”. On Saturday, I made the 6-hour journey and spent the day killing time as he said he would be free after dinner and that there was a club near the place I was staying that we could go to with one of his friends and we confirmed these plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "These plans were finalized at 9:30pm, and I had just sat down to dinner. I rushed through my food as I wanted time to get ready and texted him for an idea of what time he’d come meet me. He didn’t reply for til 11pm and said he’d let me know after dinner. I was getting a bit pissed but fine. I then go to a bar by myself. At 1am I see the club we were going to start closing. I text him to ask again if he has an idea of timings and told him we might need a new plan since the club we were going to go to was closing. He replied at about 1:30am saying they were trying to make a plan, at which point I left the bar to go back to where I was staying because I was getting sad looks from the bartender. I was exhausted, having only 1.5h of sleep the night before due to the long travel. I texted him a few times over the next hour and a bit asking if we were still going out and he only replied the once saying they were still planning. I lay in my bed until 3am waiting to hear from him with my dress and make up on, hair still done… just in case. In the end I told him I just had to go to sleep and I did, and I checked in the morning and he hadn’t even replied to that. He was supposed to be taking me to the party on Sunday, so I texted him to ask when he was picking me up, (party started at 3pm) and he texted me at 2:45 saying he’d left town to go back home and he wasn’t going to the party. I think this whole thing was so so beyond rude and disrespectful of my time, but my best friend said I was being too clingy and that scared him off. I don’t think I was being clingy by wanting to know what our plans were.\n",

      "I (NB16) am in a rock climbing club, but we all hang out outside of club together. We are all some level of fruity, with one token straight friend (M17), Adam. He often says some insensitive things, but he always apologizes when we correct him. Noticeably, he'll misgender either me or the trans girl (F17) on our team, Amy. We also have three different group chats because of some glitches. We've named one of these our planning chat, which Adam is very particular about. He won't let any memes into the chat.\n",

      "This weekend, we were at the arcade to celebrate our friend's graduation (M17), Brad. We were going to play boys against girls in laser tag and Adam insisted Amy join the boys team because \"she's more fit to be on the boy's team\". Amy is pretty early in her transition, so she gets mistaken for a boy often. Since I was on the girls team, I offered to switch with Amy. Adam was a bit pissy, but he sucked it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started getting late and a couple people were already going home, so we agreed on playing billiards until everyone had a ride. Adam started, very loudly, telling a joke very loudly about a trans woman and a lesbian, the punchline being \"Why would you transition if you still like women?\"\n",

      "Basically, he believed any and all misinformation about trans people and he wouldn't hear any of us out.

After almost an hour of arguing, we just decided to leave it.\n",

Adam got really mad, targeting us and specifically telling us to remove our memes. After we didn't, he left all three of the chats and blocked me, Amy, and Charlie.\n",

      "Body text: My bf(M27) argued with me (F28) about how I barely post him. This is not the first time we’ve spoken about this topic, but it seems to keep coming up whenever I talk about posting on my instagram. For context, I have a little over 2000 followers and I mostly post where I travel, random aesthetically pleasing photos and myself all in tasteful fashion. I want to say I post every 3-4 months out of the year and I mostly post stories like 1-3 times a week, so in my opinion not that often. For stories it’s me at the gym, what I’m eating, sometimes what I’m doing with friends and again a selfie now and then. My bf and I have been dating for about 1 year and 3 months. I’ve posted him on my story for “national boyfriend day” in October, for his birthday, for our anniversary and for Valentine’s Day. He did have to ask me to post him in October, for our anniversary and for Valentine’s Day though, even though at first he said I didn’t have to but he wanted me to, so I did. I do have one picture of him on my instagram along with other pics of where we went to vacation together, but I don’t have him tagged. He said he feels a bit insecure about the random guys I follow on there and who like my pictures, but I honestly don’t talk to them or pay them any mind, I’m barely on there to begin with but I’ve had it since high school so I don’t want to make a new one from scratch. I like my privacy which is why I don’t post too much about my life and with my relationship before I was the same way. I’d post stories with him here and there but not too much, so is he right to feel like I don’t want to show him off or am I the asshole? \n",

      "\n",
      "so this literally just happened and I need some help. my (29M) girlfriend of four years and I were video chatting on Discord, but she disconnected after saying \"she can't\" with me right now and she needs a break from me. she was sharing some tattoo ideas dedicated to her late grandfather who passed away last year, and she shared that he was a silly guy and always had a lot of funny/silly lines to say to them on repeat. I won't go into detail about his \"quotes,\" but they were mostly pun-related or in broken English (idk how else to describe them). I thought it was cute and wondered if there's a chance he might have been autistic, so I asked her. she got offended and asked me if I was serious/joking and why I would ask her that. I told her I'm genuinely curious about it and interested what she thinks. we've watched a few episodes of Love on the Spectrum so we both don't associate autism with any negative connotation-- it's just something some people have and that's fine, so I was surprised that she took offense to my question. I think she viewed it as I was making a joke or making fun of her recently-passed grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sincerely did not mean to offend and I wasn't saying her granddad WAS autistic-- I was just trying to ask her opinion and have a conversation about it. I tried asking her, \"why do you seem offended by that?\" but she didn't give me any straightforward answer. she just asked me if I think just being silly meant that someone was autistic. I said no, but I was just genuinely curious about what she thought. then she asked me, \"do you think you're narcissistic because you seem to care more about yourself and what people think of you than me or our relationship?\" and I got caught off guard and didn't know what to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I admit it's been a reoccurring problem for us where sometimes I break a boundary or forget something that she told me before, especially when other parties are involved (I've got people pleaser issues that I'm trying to get better at), and it makes her feel like I care less about her than how other people see me. in response to her asking if I think I'm narcissistic, I just said \"I hope not\" if that's what constitutes as narcissism. that's when she disconnected and said she needed a break from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know she loves her grandfather very much and she was heartbroken when he passed away. I know now that it was a mistake to ask her that because she's still sensitive about it and got mad at me for it. I also know that just having silly idiosyncrasies doesn't immediately make someone autistic-- but I was genuinely interested in what she thought and honestly didn't expect her to get offended because of how both of us view ASD.\n",
      "\n",
      "now she's not talking to me and idk what to do or say. I know I fucked up because what I said hurt her, but I didn't say sorry right away because I was still trying to understand why she was so mad at me. how do I apologize and make things right? am I an asshole for how I behaved? thanks Reddit\n",

I didn't realize how tactless I behaved. I let my curiosity get the better of me instead of just being empathetic to my partner's vulnerability sharing stuff she loved about her late grandfather. and then I even tried to justify it and defend myself instead of apologizing because it upset her.\n",

      "Body text: My coworker is slightly overweight. Just a few pounds chubby. Not exactly fat but you can tell she’s not really a gym person. She told me that she doesn’t really workout that much. When all of a sudden one day she told me shes going to run a 10k which is 6 miles. I didn’t really believe her so I just nodded. I just smiled and said good luck with that. Considering that she told me she doesn’t workout, running a 10k without training sounded like a lie. Well the next week, she actually ran it. She showed me a picture of her time and how long she ran it. She averaged 10 minutes per mile and she told me she never stopped. As someone who only ever ran a 5k, I was really surprised that she did that. I have trouble running a 9 minute mile consistently for a 5k. I told her I’m very impressed and I didn’t think she had it in her. She sounded offended, and she asked if I was calling her fat. I said no but said I didn’t expect her to run it. Then she told me she’ll continue running to not be fat. Am I the asshole? \n",

Since only one of our friends is employed and he’s kinda greedy, he will support the replacement prices. I came up with a new idea to use the DIY Pringles can and just have a shared one for sleepovers until we could save up money for more, usually we’d just clean the fleshlights out with warm water and share because we’ve been friends for a long time. However, I wanted to make the Pringles can fun like project for us and after we collected the tape, rubber gloves, and sponge I made a suggestion: why not add some Aveeno lotion and put a small lithium battery in the inside to keep it warm and match the realistic feeling. Immediately my buddies started saying it was weird and a stupid idea and basically are ignoring me and it seems like they’re gonna make it without me. The worst part is I was gonna pay for the lithium battery and use my own lotion to create it, I thought everyone would appreciate my innovation. AITA?\n",

She’s shy and has a hard time connecting with kids her age. It’s been heartbreaking at times, and we’ve always tried to encourage her and help her build confidence.\n",

      "A few months ago, L finally made a new friend at school—we’ll call her “A.” A is Indian, and I was genuinely relieved at first to see L bonding with someone.

But I’m trying to raise L to speak clearly, develop good manners, and have strong social skills—especially at this age when things are really impressionable.

      "Body text: Hello! I'm going to try to present this as objectively as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife (36f) and I (39m) have a 4 month old son, in addition to a 2 year old daughter. I'm currently on paternity leave and am his primary caretaker. I do all of his feedings at night and tend to him throughout the day while my wife works from home. He hasn't been sleeping very well lately and is sometimes extremely fussy throughout the night. For whatever reason, I'm having an extremely tough time being his primary source of care and it's beginning to take a toll on my mental health. It's nearly impossible to get anything done during the day, such as showering, cleaning, and chores, because he is very needy and I'm always super tired. As a result, I've begun to look into temporary assistance from a nanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife, however, is completely against this idea. From her perspective, I need to suck it up and take charge of the situation. She had 3 months of maternity leave and was his primary caregiver during 2 of those months, so she thinks that if she can do it, I should be able to as well. I've explained to her that I'm not cut out for this and I'm having a very difficult time, but she won't listen. She looks at me like I'm crazy when I suggest getting help and says it's ridiculous. She also says it's a waste of money, but I'm the primary breadwinner and have the budget for this. There are no immediate needs that would be hindered by paying for a nanny. Frankly, I'm surprised at her lack of sympathy for something that I feel like I desperately need. She has offered to jump in and help if I'm having trouble, but her schedule is unpredictable and I'd rather have someone dedicated 3-4 hours a day so I can get some rest and get chores done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, we've had a few fights about this because I feel like she's being selfish and is downplaying my feelings, which makes me very angry as I'm feeling very unsupported. Am I the asshole for looking for some additional help until he's in daycare full time in August?\n",

She plays year round and has done so since she was 14. Her mom and I are divorced and she spends one week with me and one with her mom, switching on Sundays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sport takes up whole weekends the majority of the year, so she ends up playing Friday-Sunday/Monday( if it's a holiday weekend) which means I miss a lot of time with her because she is playing her sport on a day that should be mine. Her mom pays for the sport 100 percent and I allow her to play, this was the agreement we had. The program costs $6500 a year plus travel. My ex wife says she spent about $12,000 on just the travel this year. Probably not, I think she said that just to see if I would help pay for it, which I didn't. She and/or her mom do all the transportation to games and tournaments. I don't go because that's not how I prefer to spend my weekends.\n",

Last week was my daughter's week with her mom which means she should have transitioned to me on Sunday, but they were \"out of town\" for the tournament. They were in the same area as we live in, about 30 miles away, but since the tournament was held downtown in a major US city on a holiday weekend, my ex wife opted to stay in a hotel rather than drive up and down every day. \n",

I said I didn't want to do that and that my daughter could just drive to my house after they got home from the tournament. My ex wife said ok.\n",

      "Well on Monday my wife was busy with her family so I decided to drive up and watch my daughter play. My ex wife asked if I was going to take our daughter home, since it was my day.

      "Well, my daughter didn't come over for 2 hours! I texted my daughter but she didn't respond so I texted my ex wife and demanded to know why my daughter hadn't come home yet. My ex wife responded that she was probably napping and would be there soon. I told her that I expected my daughter in the next 5 minutes because that's how long it takes to drive between houses. She finally got there about 15 minutes later. I again texted my ex that this was unacceptable. My ex wife said that she offered me the chance to drive my daughter and I refused, so she asked why I was being such an ass then. I told her it was because she had made our daughter late and cut into my time. That was the last I heard from my ex yesterday.\n",

She was clearly drunk at the time (the voicemail was left on the night she was having her “at home” hen do, which I also obviously didn’t attend) but it was so beyond anything I thought she was capable of.

His attempts to reach them were ignored apart from 1 email from what I think was a fake law firm outlining the money was “gifted”, the contract was fraudulent and to take them to court basically. In response to that BIL sent a copy of the voicemail Katie left and a final demand outlining the payment plan was now null and void and we wanted the money in full within 30 days or we would indeed be going to court. Magically the full amount appeared in our accounts 5 days later. \n",

When I go to her home, I smell it, but I don’t say anything to her about it because it’s her space, she can do what she wants, but my husband and I don’t allow it in our house so she almost never comes over because she knows I’ll say something if I smell it on her or her kids (my grandkids).\n",

      "Next month my husband and I are having an anniversary party/ birthday celebration (both of us turn 40 this year) as well as a vow renewal. We had a courthouse wedding right before Covid so we never got a chance to celebrate with our friends and family like we wanted to so we decided to do one big celebration now. When we first started discussing what we wanted, I said I would like it if our kids were able to stand with us during our renewal. I have my daughter, his son, and our daughter together. I asked the kids if they were open to do that with us and they all agreed and so we made plans and had discussions about what I would like them to wear and whatnot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, I called my daughter to confirm that she had everything under control as far as what she was going to wear including accessories and during our conversation I had made the request that her and her husband refrain from smoking while at the park were having the party at. She became very upset and started to yell at me asking if I was planning on restricting anyone from drinking alcohol and my response was that we are not providing any alcohol to anyone so if they bring it and drink it I can’t stop them. She then told me that she doesn’t know how long she will be staying then if she won’t be allowed to even go to her car to smoke. Again it’s not even LEGAL to use in public spaces like the park. My husband works for the police department and he’s invited a few of his friends from work so there’s that as well. So am I the asshole for asking her to refrain from smoking for one day?\n",

      "2) She has been told that she can have edibles, but please keep them in the car for a few reasons which include not being obvious that she’s consuming something in front of the police chief. \n",

      "3) My husband is the one who set up with the park manager for us to use the space and said we can have alcohol. If it turns out we can’t, then we will deal with that then. \n",

      "4) IDK how this turned into a “you were a teen mom so it’s no wonder you kid is so screwed up” post, and not that it’s really anyone’s business, but it’s not my fault that I was a teen mom but I did what I could and waited until I was in a committed relationship before I had my second (and last). \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The only time that I have ever said anything to her about the smell was when she was a minor (under 18) and when she comes into my spaces (my house, car, etc). Otherwise I deal with it. It gives me a headache and makes my stomach turn, and I’m sorry but I really don’t want to have to deal with that on my day\n",

      "Body text: Hi! I (26F) and my friend from college (26F) both moved into the same apartment building. She lives on the floor above mine. One weekend she put me along with a bunch of our mutual friends in a group chat because she wanted to have a barbecue on our roof. She has hosted many before, but this would be the first one I ever attended. Because I don’t eat red meat I did not eat anything that was cooked on the grill and only brought chips a bottle and paper plates. When the day was over, the group of us went downstairs to watch a reality show. My friend who lives in my building and the girl who owned the grill discussed that they would leave the grill to cool off. Once the reality show it was over, I went back to my apartment and went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day everyone in my building receives an email saying that there was a fire on the roof last night because someone dumped coals in the trashcan on the roof and they re-lit due to the wind. I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to my friend who then put it in the group chat of everyone. her and our other friend, who owned the grill, told us that they decided to take the grill home the same day because they didn’t wanna have to come back and get it the next day. So the girl in my building gave the grill owner her keys to go get the grill on the roof and the grill owner decided that it would be the best thing to just toss the coals into the trashcan on the roof. Our building requires multiple key taps to get on and off the roof and they also have cameras so they immediately told  my friend in my building she was responsible since it was her guest using her keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, my friend came to me and asked me to put it on my insurance since she nor the grill owner, had renters insurance. I spoke with a few lawyers and my old insurance agent, and they all said that this would be fraud. So I told my friend I did not feel comfortable doing so. Another week goes by and she asked me again because she believed that she would have to go bankrupt over the situation (she did not). I again said no because I did not feel comfortable and reiterated that I was told that this would be fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "From then, she started to run a smear campaign, saying that I was the bad friend and all of our friend group stop talking to me because they said that I should’ve at least tried to put it on my insurance. They now all want me to apologize to all of them and work for their friendship again since they believe that I was in the wrong but I feel like I didn’t do any wrong. So WITA?\n",

On the money issue, I spent some time trying to work out the cost breakdown since many people asked about the numbers. All prices have been converted to USD. The total cost for the 7-night cabin stay was $1,744. My girlfriend and I covered half of that (3.5 nights), and the other half was split between Frank, Liam, and Jay.\n",

Frank paid me a few days later and asked if we could meet so he could explain what happened at our local bar \n",

      "I was to see Ed there when my GF and I arrived. It took some time for the conversation to start, but Ed eventually told us his relationship with his parents has been rocky due to his sexuality. A few months before the cabin trip, he brought Frank home to meet them for the first time, and his parents made them sleep in separate rooms. Ed said his folks implied that he and Frank would be kicked out if they didn't. He said that when I refused to let them use the master bedroom, it brought up those bad feelings, and he misdirected his anger at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t totally buy that explanation, not the full extent of it, but I can understand how not being allowed to share a bed might bring up bad memories for him. For Frank’s sake, I agreed to let it go and told them I appreciated the apology, but I still need space. I’m not ready to pick up where we left off. \n",

      "My friends usually talk about taking another trip in November at this time, but I think I’ll find somewhere closer to go with my girlfriend so I don’t have to deal with this group drama again. I'm still not entirely over her not having my back either, so nothing's in the works right now.

And he says \"My friend wants a reward\". And I say \"thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave\". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say \"I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops\". The kid then says \"call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*.

I didn't feel unsafe about the boys themselves, more annoyance because it was stressing the dog out (although them standing there for a while made me think someone might have been coercing them to stay there until someone answered the door, but that might just be my anxiety). I was also extremely stressed about the reactive dog and that played a big factor into me not wanting to open the door when I could accomplish what needed to be said (a thank you and leaving in the mailbox is fine) through the ring doorbell. I also felt kinda weirded out when one boy came back and not the other. I mentioned my age and size because you'd be surprised at how people assume you are naive when you're a) young and b) a woman and c) know that you might be home alone. \n",

From what I can tell, it’s mostly stuff that’s like fantasy, science fiction, or paranormal that happens. Forums for shows I like tend to all be “This character is over hater” or “X is a bad person” The closest I’ve come to anything like that is watching a few episodes of Star Trek with my dad as a kid. I usually like real life dramas or fun light-hearted shows like Sex and the City or Friends.

I had borrowed a pair of her sneakers (she told me not to pack more sneakers cause I can borrow hers), I packed my heels and purses that we planned to share. I assumed I’d be wearing the sneakers I used for the airport to leave to come back home. That morning, she decided to wear them instead—which is totally fine, duh, they’re hers. She offered me another pair, but I didn’t want to wear those. I noticed another pair outside her suitcase and asked if I could wear them. She danced around the question, beat around the bush, I then said “you don’t want me to wear these right?” She said no. I responded, “Just say that then.”\n",

It wasn’t that deep TO ME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said something that really hurt me: “I talk to my sisters like that, but we’re just friends, not family, so that’s not acceptable between us.” That stung. She’s been sleeping in my bed, helping cook for my family, sharing life with us for weeks. (Not to say because of this that I can speak to her however, I understand where she was coming from on that but her saying THIS sprouted a completely separate issue) I’ve always seen her as family, even if we’re not blood. I said, “You’re staying in my house,” and she backtracked: “Don’t get it twisted, you are family—but friends shouldn’t talk like that.” Still, the damage was done. I feel like I crossed a line once, but she dismissed the whole foundation of our bond.\n",

They let me live at home rent-free during college, gave me a lot of academic support growing up (I wasn’t a naturally strong student like my brother), and have always been loving in most other ways. This situation hurt, but it doesn’t erase everything they’ve done for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother’s Day was tense. As soon as I arrived, my mom said, “I don’t want another fight to ruin today,” when I tried to bring up the money again. I left after brunch. We finally talked this past weekend. My brother said he hadn’t known about the “wedding fund” until I brought it up and felt awful it was causing tension. He’s rethinking grad school now, saying it might be smarter to get work experience first. He applied to MBA programs and jobs while finishing undergrad, graduated early in December, and got into the program he planned to attend. Now he’s planning to defer and focus on the job search instead.\n",

      "My mom wasn’t happy. She said she didn’t want him giving up an amazing opportunity just because I was “being bitter.” That really stung. I told her I wasn’t bitter, I was blindsided. I found out about the money during a conversation where I was being asked to hand over $15,000 for someone else’s future. That was painful, especially since I’d turned down opportunities because no help was available. I just wish I’d known.\n",

      "That’s when my dad stepped in. After I was born, he started saving for what he imagined as my dream wedding. It was sentimental to him. When my brother was born, they saved a similar amount for his wedding or family expenses. Neither of us knew these funds existed. They only considered using his for school when other aid fell short. After I said no, they decided to use both funds to help him and figured they’d replenish mine later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get why it made sense to them, but it still hurt. Many commenters pointed out the situation was sexist, even if unintentionally. It’s hard not to feel like I was expected to get married while my brother was expected to succeed. I don’t think that’s what they meant, but that’s how it felt. To their credit, they listened. My dad apologized for not telling me sooner. My mom didn’t fully agree, but I think she heard me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother asked if I’d help with his resume and interview prep, and I said yes. I told him I know this isn’t his fault. He’s worked hard and deserves what he’s earned. I just needed to feel like my path mattered too. We’re not back to 100%, but it feels better. I’m glad we talked.\n",

      "Now, she's always been like this. Every time we've seen a movie where something even slightly scary happens, she gasps super loud or screams at the top of her lungs. It's okay when we're watching movies at home because, like, it's in a private space, but when she does this at movie theaters it's so embarrassing! Especially if it's a silent scene and she's making these little gasping noises in fear of what's about to occur. \n",

      "Anyways, I really didn't want to see this movie (I respect the final destination franchise, but I'm not good with horror/thrillers), but she begged me to go. I said okay, we go, the movie starts blah blah blah and then a character dies and she immediately yells like she's never yelled before. I'm leaning away from her out of embarrassment and I swear the lady next to me is glaring at my mom. Well this happens again and again and again and it gets to a point, so during the next death (mri scene), I cover her mouth with my hand and let her scream into it. \n",

      "\n",
      "Movie finally ends, we get out of the movie theater, into her car, and she starts yelling at me. She calls me disrespectful for putting my filthy (girl bye) hand over her mouth and that I was an a-hole. I tell her that everytime she screamed like she'd witnessed the death in front of her, I got embarrassed and people started looking at us! That she can do it at home, but not in public where other people are trying to enjoy the movie. \n",

Additionally, I know it was wrong of me to go when I knew that she was like this, but I just thought she had changed since it had been a few years since we'd seen a horror movie together at the theaters (probably before covid). Anyways, later I'm going to apologize for what I did and gently tell her that her huge reactions are disruptive. I hope it goes well. Thanks again!\n",

I’m not sure if she realizes it, but the odor is strong enough that her entire room smells, and my mom has to use a special detergent just to get the scent out of her clothes.\n",

      "At first, I assumed it was a puberty phase, as she was in middle school when it started, but I just got back from college, and unfortunately, it’s still a major issue, maybe even worse.

I’d rather she hear it from me, someone who cares, than from a roommate or stranger in a cruel or embarrassing way.

      "I also spoke to my mom, as many of you suggested. It turns out she has addressed the issue with my sister more directly than I realized. I had brought it up with her before, but until I asked today, I didn’t know she had actually spoken to my sister about it. My mom believes the root of the issue is my sister’s depression, which often leaves her without the energy or motivation to keep up with hygiene.\n",

      "While my son grew up, my sister got a degree in Special Needs Education and started teaching a special needs elementary class. Over the years, my sister has been increasingly giving my wife and I more and more unsolicited advice on how to parent my son. Which is fine in theory, but instead of taking us to the side and giving us her professional opinion, she tends to actively disregard the way we want to teach my son, in front of him, and in a condescending way. For example, when my son was being rude, I corrected him and sent him to his room. My sister stepped in and said “Don’t send him to his room, he doesn’t know what he’s doing.” Another example is: Lately we’ve been trying to promote independence in him so when my son said he was thirsty, I said “So go get yourself some water”. My sister said “Oh, I’ll get it!” So I respectfully responded to her saying “Actually can he get it himself? We are trying to teach him independence.” She answered with “No, he can’t do it himself.” Our son even protested and said he wanted to do it himself, but she sternly turned him down, only to get him his water for him.\n",

Telling her to stop telling us what to do and how to do it. She argued with us saying that it’s her job and we have repeatedly disrespected the fact that she has a degree in this. We told her that she doesn’t know what it’s like to be a parent and how being a teacher is completely different.\n",

      "\n",
      "For background, I used to wear my AirPods a lot while doing things around the house, and my husband felt like I was not present and was tuning him out. I understood his feelings and made a conscious effort to change—I now rarely wear my AirPods in common areas of our home or when I know he’s around.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I work from home a few days a week, and when I’m in my home office, I wear headphones for calls or to listen to music so I can focus (I have ADHD and this really helps me). This morning, I was checking emails and listening to music in my office when my husband came in, visibly upset. He said he’d been calling my name from downstairs and was frustrated that I didn’t hear him because of my headphones. He was looking for his computer charger and said that if he didn’t have to run up and down the stairs, he’d have more energy to take care of things at home. He then told me I needed to empty the dishwasher because he was “too tired” of having to run up and down the stairs all of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side note: He does a lot around the house, which I really do appreciate. I am happy to do my part, but often he gets to things before I do because I’m working during the day. He is currently interviewing for jobs, but even though he isn’t working right now, he’s very busy working on our new house, networking, applying, and interviewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another instance last week: He told me in the morning he’d be going to the grocery store, so I helped make the list and then went to my home office to work. I had calls that morning, so my AirPods were in. I didn’t know exactly when he was planning to leave, or that he had left, because I was working. When he got home, he called my name to help unload groceries, but I didn’t hear him. He was frustrated again and said we keep having the same issue with my AirPods. I told him if I’d known he wanted help unloading or when he was coming back, I would have been ready, but I can’t monitor his actions while I’m working. He disagrees and says I’m in the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree that it was an issue in the past, but him expecting me to not wear my AirPods at all while I’m working feels a bit extreme. I feel frustrated because it’s hard for me to focus on work as it is, and I don’t think it’s fair for him to expect me to be available at any moment during my work hours just because I’m at home. I also feel like some of these issues could be solved with clearer communication, but he feels I should just be more considerate because he’s also busy.\n",

      "Body text: I (42F) live in a two-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Sarah (38F). We’ve been friends since college and have lived together for three years. Our lease is month-to-month, and we split rent and utilities evenly. We’ve always had a good dynamic, with clear boundaries about guests, shared spaces, and household responsibilities.About two months ago, Sarah started dating Alex (28M). They hit it off quickly, and Alex has been spending a lot of time at our place—sometimes staying over four or five nights a week. I didn’t mind at first, as Alex is polite and cleans up after himself. But last week, Sarah sat me down and asked if Alex could move in permanently. She said he’s struggling to find an affordable place in our city, and since he’s already here so often, it “makes sense” for him to join the lease and split rent three ways.Here’s where the conflict comes in. I said no. I told Sarah I’m not comfortable with a third person living in our small apartment, especially someone I’ve only known for two months. The place is already cozy for two, with one bathroom and limited kitchen space. I also value the dynamic we have as roommates, and I’m worried adding Alex (who I don’t know well) could disrupt that. Plus, I wasn’t consulted before Sarah and Alex clearly started planning this, which made me feel a bit blindsided.Sarah got upset. She said I’m being selfish and not considering her happiness or Alex’s situation. She argued that splitting rent three ways would save us all money (true, it’d drop my share by about $200/month), and that I’m “gatekeeping” our home out of paranoia. Alex even chimed in, saying he’d respect my space and wouldn’t be a burden. I held firm, saying I’m not ready for a new roommate and that our lease agreement is between Sarah and me, not a third party.Since then, Sarah’s been distant, and Alex has stopped coming over as much, which makes things awkward. I overheard Sarah on the phone saying she might move out if I’m “going to be like this.” I feel bad because I don’t want to ruin our friendship or make her feel like she can’t have a relationship, but I also think it’s fair to want a say in who lives in my home.AITA for refusing to let Alex move in?\n",

In the meantime, hair keeps growing, so I scheduled appointments for both to continue where I want them. \n",

Nor does she put any effort into her hair — she pretty much walks out of bed and to school, maybe throwing a brush through it if we tell her to. For my husband, that’s reason to not spend money on it because she clearly doesn’t care about what her hair looks like. For me, that’s the sign of a good haircut — you don’t have to do shit to feel fine with it. As someone who used to spend 3 hours with the 3 different straighteners on high to do her hair when she was young, that’s something I really wish I had. \n",

When we got there, what I was told was a Malinois, came up to us and sniffed and pawed at us.  I told it to get away, and it did.  My son does not like dogs since an incident at the park.  I told it to get away a few more times in the next few minutes as we said hi to people.  I noticed another dog outside.  We were not told about the dogs ahead of time and my son didn't want to play with his friends as he was hesitant to be away from me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm friendly with the host parents, but we don't know each other outside of our kids' activities.  I approached mom, thanked her for the invitation and complemented their house.  I asked her to lock the dogs away and explained the situation with my son.  She looked clearly annoyed at the request.  She told me she doesn't react well to being locked away and asserted that they were friendly and safe.  I reiterated my son was not okay with dogs and didn't want to be around them.  She said with the house full like this the dogs want to be a part of the party and they wouldn't be going anywhere.  She was clearly not okay with my request and implied we wouldn't be invited in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "She left to attend to something else and we decided to leave the party.  My son seemed okay with that decision as he perked up when we were in the car.  I got a text later from the host saying my request was inappropriate.  AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT:  The conversation was 2 minutes tops.  It was not extended and we were at the hosts house maybe 10 minutes.  \n",

      "Title: AITA for telling my father he has no right to complain about my apartment even though he used to own it?\n",
      "Body text: My father moved abroad in late 2023. At the time, I was pregnant with my second child, and my husband and I were looking for a new place. Because of that, my father offered to let us buy his apartment - a 3-bedroom unit, which he was already trying to sell before moving - for a slightly lower price. We accepted, because we both liked the place (I'd lived there with my father for a few years) and the building was well-located.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to owning an apartment, my father and I are very different. For starters, I have two small children, which automatically impacts how tidy my place is. We also have different preferences regarding interior design - think contemporary (my father) versus mid century modern (me). \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, my father used to make constant changes to his home (switching chairs, replacing wallpaper, etc.) every few months, which I’ve always found exhausting. In other words, the apartment looks very different now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, my father visited us for my daughter’s first birthday. He didn’t stay at our place (most I could offer was the couch), but came over a few times. \n",
      "\n",
      "He very clearly didn’t like the way our apartment looked, nor did he attempt to hide it. He was polite during his visits, but made frequent comments about the things we’d changed (“Oh, look, you had my wall painted!”) and how messy the place looked now. I figured he was just processing things as he hadn’t been there in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father left yesterday. A few hours before his flight, he called me and said he was extremely hurt by all the changes we made. During the call, he listed many of the things he disliked, including there being “too much color,” the fact we don’t have any rugs on the floor and the lack of pictures of my grandfather (his dad).\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me he wouldn’t have given us the apartment if he’d known we’d “ruin it” so much. I replied that he didn’t “give it” to us, he *sold* it to us. The apartment isn’t his anymore, and he has no right to complain about it. My father then hung up on me and boarded the plane.\n",

      "Body text: I (23F) was on a camping trip in a busy city with two friends (both 23F). We went out to some bars and met a guy who invited us to join a party bus for a bachelor party. I will never make this decision again and I understand how utterly, seriously stupid it was. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the bus were about 8 men and one woman who was completely unresponsive—head down, not speaking or moving. When I asked about her, one guy said “she’s fine, I checked her pulse.” Another man told me to leave her alone and later claimed to be her boyfriend, even though he originally said they met her during the bachelor trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to wake her and checked her pulse, which felt slow. I asked a friend to call 911 and she refused so I did it myself. While I stayed with the woman, my friends left the bus and went into the apartment with some of the bachelor party. I found them, and we waited outside and EMTs came. The woman started waking up confused, saying things like “why am I here?” and had to be carried off the bus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward, my friends were angry at me and told me I should’ve minded my own business and an EMT will be way too expensive and they would have never wanted one called in that situation. I feel bad for ruining the night for everyone. AITA for getting involved? \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I got a hotel last night so I didn’t have to sleep with my friends because it got a little heated as we waited for the Uber. I just talked to them because we still have to get home together. I asked them to come to the hotel so we can talk and I will give an update later. \n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: This is coming so quick because we were able to figure some things out and have a much more rational conversation in the daytime lol. Our conversation cleared A LOT up. Basically, I was talking to a different group of men than my friends. I learned that the group of men planned to have the party bus driver bring the woman to the hospital. I would not have trusted this unless I actively saw her receive care to be honest though. They also were told this woman was one of the men’s girlfriends. Also, apparently another man called 911 before I did which makes sense because it arrived quicker than I expected. They apologized and I forgave them and apologized as well for raising my voice waiting for the Uber. It was definitely a big miscommunication so please dont be mean to my friends. Now should I show them this post to be fully transparent and honest? \n",

      "Body text: My 13 year old step son’s mother bought him a puppy over the weekend. Awesome! It was our weekend with our son when they picked him up and he asked if he could bring him over to our house for his younger siblings to meet him. We said OK but only for a bit outside because I am mildly allergic.  In addition, we don’t want to be responsible for an animal with our hectic lives. After the puppy left, my step son said he will need to bring the dog over when his mom is “too busy” to watch him because the dog is his responsibility. I said we won’t be able to do that and explained why for the reasons above. I thought it was settled. Today, during her parenting time, she dropped him off because she has a doctor’s appointment and can’t watch him. I told my husband this is a slippery slope and he needs to tell her she can’t drop off the dog anymore unless she gets direct permission from my husband (but would prefer to not allow it at all) My step son didn’t like that and thinks I’m being unreasonable. As a side note- my husband and his ex-wife don’t have an amicable relationship.\n",

      "Body text: I (M36) and my partner (M35) have been together for 12 years and have had lots of holidays, some as just a pair, other times as a family. Most recently, we've had 4 consecutive holidays with his family where we visited their desired location, did their desired activities and I didn't get any real say on any element of anything we did.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common theme in the family holidays is looking around tourist-tat shops, charity shops, sitting around eating greggs sausage rolls, incense and crystal shops etc. or sitting in a pub or on a beach. I appreciate the pubs, but I don't like the beach and will spend most of my time on holiday stood outside a shop staring into the middle distance.\n",

      "This weekend just gone I arranged for us both to go away to Portsmouth, I don't know what he had expected, but I had made plans to go to visit HMS Victory, see the Mary Rose museum and a few local sites and spend the evening drinking and relaxing. Immediately after we arrived (we were there one night) I said we needed to get a wriggle on and go to where I wanted to visit and was told \"it would be nice to find some souvenirs\" which I dismissed straight away and made a direct route to the museums(the intention of the holiday) and after visiting them, we had to wander around looking for tourist tat shops because he had promised his mum something with \"Portsmouth\" printed on it. Turns out, the shops were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that evening we were having a drink and I was told the following day we had to \"find a shop selling fridge magnets for my mum\", I pulled up a Portsmouth fridge magnet on amazon and said we can just buy that and save 45 minutes of faffing around. I then said \"this isn't a Smith holiday, it's an us holiday\"(pretend Smith is his family name) and he got very offended. I explained how all previous family holidays I spend 90% of my time being dragged to tourist shops and would like a weekend away without that and he claimed I was being an arsehole and unappreciative as his family \"always do what you want to do\". I mentioned a time when we visited Cornwall and I wasn't allowed to visit the Eden project and he replied \"who the fuck wants to go there?\"\n",

      "Body text: UPDATE.....after my sons college tour in my husbands home town we took his parents to dinner. They began raving about what a nice time graduation was and thanked us so much for everything we did to gather our family because living in several different states means we rarely spend time as a whole family. My husband immediately addressed the fact that he is no longer willing to subject his wife/kids to that extended side of the family. They are trouble and beneath us.

      "\n",
      "I(40F) and my husband(41m) have a high school graduate! We rented a 6k sq ft house for 2 days so that all of my husbands family traveling from out of town could all fit under 1 roof while we enjoy family time and celebrate our graduate. The graduation was at 9:30am and we planned an open invite party(meaning specific invited people CLOSE to us who could not attend the ceremony...not open to any randos that show up.....envision alcohol free family affair with a ton of kids running around) with family and friends to come as they please through the rest of the day to celebrate with us. We were surprised to see that my brother in law's brother(48m)(family of family. Not my family) drove 2 hours and arrived at 6pm. He came with several people my husband and I dont know and actually just came to see his brother, not to celebrate our son. Before even saying hello to myself or my husband the guy pulls out a crap ton of drugs and spreads it all over the table on our front porch. Underneith 4 cameras of this bnb that I am responsible for. My nephew came to let me know and I immediately let them know how insanely inappropriate and disrespectful it was and had my husband make them leave. That day was for my son...not an extended family drug reunion. I dont know those people. They had to go! I had an open invite for my family, friends and even our sons teachers and coaches to visit at any point. My husband and his sister seem to agree that it was wrong for him to do that but think that I went over board by making them leave. They feel that putting the drugs away and apologizing should have been enough. AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "***edited to say...for clarification...this was not a \"2 day party\". Graduation was at 9:30am and we had family driving in from states away arriving the night before graduation. Then the 2nd night was so that those relatives could stay the day of graduation to celebrate and leave the next morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "The story is embarrassingly 1000% true for those who have doubt. My only regret is making my husband kick them out rather than me doing it myself. They drove 2 hours and had to leave 5 minutes into it. That is the main reason why my husband and sis in law think I went over board. I stand firm in my decision and simply needed unbiased feedback to reinforce my stance as this is still an ongoing issue within the family and extended family. \n",

      "Me (39f) and my husband (39m) got into an argument tonight because I would rather do a sailing course than go to his half Ironman. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context, we’ve been married for 2 years and dated for 7. The whole time I’ve known him he’s been into endurance sports. He’s done multiple marathons, sprint and half Ironmans, and one full Ironman. I have attended almost all of his races to cheer him on. If you know anything about this world, it is A LOT for the spouses and families. We plan almost every summer around his race calendar and training schedules. This means taking our vacations in the off season or him training during our vacation. And him doing many hours of training during the week and on weekends. This is totally cool with me as I like my alone time and am generally pretty independent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the argument. I’ve been wanting to learn to sail since 2020 but due to COVID and some personal health issues it hasn’t happened yet. This year we moved spitting distance to a marina and I’ve made friends with people who sail. I feel like it’s finally meant to be and I can’t wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that the sailing course I want to take is only offered on certain dates. Due to other plans we have this summer, the first one I could do overlaps with his half Ironman so I wouldn’t be able to go with him. If I don’t do this one, then I have to wait until mid August which is late in the season (where we live). I could find another place that offers courses but I want to join this specific club because I know people there already and they have the best facilities and events. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I explained this to him and showed him the other dates he suggested I could call in sick from work for 3 days and do a different date. I replied in a snarky way “so you want me to miss work so I can go to your Ironman?”. He immediately got annoyed, walked away and said “fine I’ll just go by myself”. This sparked a huge argument. \n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like it was an unreasonable thing to even ask me to do, and that skipping one race isn’t a big deal. He says he felt like my response was dismissive and that it was just a suggestion. He said this race has been planned for months and he was looking forward to taking the trip with me (the race is somewhere we both enjoy visiting around 3.5 hrs from where we live). \n",
      "\n",
      "While I do enjoy supporting him, attending a half Ironman isn’t a relaxing vacation for me. It’s super fun for him and I know it helps motivate him to see me cheering along the course, but it can be pretty tiring for me and I’ve been to so many at this point so why shouldn’t I put my sailing first? \n",
      "\n",
      "We talked it out and I apologized for being dismissive and snarky. He’s ok with me not going but I’m doubting now. AITA for how I reacted to his suggestion and skipping his race? Should I just take time off and do both (I wouldn’t call out sick but I could take PTO)? \n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I got the distance wrong the race is 3.5 hrs away from where we live not 7. Updated. \n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I just registered for my course! \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you to everyone who took the time to share your perspective. For people wondering why I was doubting my decision even after we initially talked, it’s because I’m a recovering people pleaser and I’m hyper aware of the faintest whiff of disappointment/negative emotion in people. \n",
      "\n",
      "This has helped me see that I’ve created the expectation over the years that I’ll attend (most) of his races. And I haven’t been open with him about how much mental and emotional effort it takes for me. We talked again this morning and I shared my honest feelings. We agreed that I won’t be going to his races in the future unless they’re a really big milestone. He expressed how appreciative he is of all the support I’ve given him and he’s very excited to support me in my sailing. This was good lesson for me in overcoming my people pleasing tendencies so thank you! \n",

She's much better now and seems to be back to near-perfect health, but there will be subsequent visits to determine if she has any other issues (such as FIV, which can't be accurately tested for so soon).\n",

The current bill by itself exceeds what we had agreed to pay Ava. Ava tried to push back more, which I ignored, and then her parents reached out to me. The four of us (me, Ava, her mom and her dad) met up, and Ava's parents immediately brought up small claims court and asked that I please not drag them and their daughter through the system over a vet bill. Just to be clear, I **never** threatened to do so. The only time court came up was when BIL brought it up to me (and I'm assuming Ava as well) and I insisted that I didn't want to make this a legal matter. I told Ava's parents the same, that I was not seeking legal action, and was happy to consider us square. The only other thing I wanted was for Ava to apologize for endangering Daisy.

She gets to the restaurant at 6:30pm, and says she was late because her boyfriend “was having a panic attack over a freelance gig he got that made him work too much” and she wanted to make sure he was okay before she left. I’m extremely pissed off at this point but we have the dinner which she then leaves an hour later at 7:30pm in order to prepare for the show. She asks us if we’re coming and I say I can’t because I’m looking forward to relaxing tonight and she looked a bit hurt. \n",

      "Only one of our friends ended up going to her show and the other 2 asked me what my plans were for the night and I said I’d like a massage to relax so we went to a spa. She found out that we got massages that night and has not talked to us or in the group chat since. Our other friend that did go to the show has been dropping hints that she thinks I’m being a bad friend by telling Lucy to break up with the boyfriend and that by not going to her show and doing something else, I wasn’t being supportive of her, especially since it was her birthday.\n",

      "Body text: I (26f) have a sister that I'll call Jenna (23f). We're not extremely close, mainly because she was always closer to our younger brother (22m), but we still see each other pretty often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, we were both invited by our mutual friend that I'll call Mary (25f) to her baby shower. The baby shower was super fun and it was a great occasion to reconnect with some friends from college that I hadn't seen in a while. Everything was going wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of the baby shower a lot of the guests had left and Mary, my sister, 2 other friends and I ended up talking for a while. Those two other friends both have children, and I have a daughter, so we were all giving Mary advice, telling her what to expect, and talking about baby stuff. Jenna was the only one in the group who didn't have children and wasn't expecting, so I guess she was feeling a bit left out. Because of that, she kept talking about her experience as a cat mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time someone would tell a story, or talk about something they experienced with their children, she'd say that she experienced something similar with her cats. When we were talking about how being a parent can be exhausting she kept talking about how having 3 cats was also hard work. No matter what we said, she was always bringing it back to her and her cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, one of my friends was talking about how much responsibility it was to raise children, and Jenna just replied \"Having cats is a huge responsibility too!\". I simply told her that that was not really the same thing and she got really defensive. She said that it was the same thing, and started to talk about all the ways that having cats can be demanding and a huge responsibility and said that we were basically shaming her for not having children. I tried to tell her that it wasn't an insult and we weren't saying that it wasn't demanding or anything, but that you can't compare having pets and having children. I have both cats and a baby, and it's nowhere near as exhausting to have a cat as it is to have a baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that we were disrespectful and invalidating her experience and didn't talk to us again until we left. She hasn't talked to me since. I get that she was feeling excluded from the conversation and maybe tried to find a way to insert herself in it, but also I feel like it makes sense for us to be talking about children since it's a baby shower. Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up but I also don't feel like what I said was really wrong, and I'm feeling like she might be overreacting a bit. But I don't really know how to feel about it so I thought I'd get another perspective on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I just realized that I didn't make it really clear that when I told her it wasn't the same, it was meant as a joke! Not a very funny one maybe, I'll give you that, but I really wasn't being mean! It was supposed to just be a light way to reply to her not at all an insult\n",

I have a “secret snack stash” filled with snacks and foods from other countries outside of the United States that I add or eat out of every once in a while. My friends from outside the U.S send me snacks and I add them to the snack drawer and place the drinks inside my mini fridge next to my bed. Both are locked, and I help pay for the shipping cost for my snacks to come in. Some of these packages that I get and help pay for can reach up to sometimes over $50. So I take care of these snacks and do not like to share with my friends or family. My family is aware and fine with this besides my older brother. \n",

Every time he comes over I become upset because he’ll come into to my room and say something to the effect of “how many snacks do you have now?” Or “Come on, you should give me something!” He will BEG me for one snack or drink from my collection but I’ve explained SEVERAL TIMES that they are my snacks and I’m not willing to share.\n",

Jackson came over around noon and I gave him my Lego box and he started playing with them. At around 2pm Jackson told me he was hungry and wanted to eat. I opened my drawer and gave him a small bag of chips and a bottle of water from my mini fridge. Jackson ate his little snack and then we both played with Legos together. Later he was picked up by my older brother and made his way home and I didn’t think much about it.\n",

He explained to me that on the ride home Jackson mentioned me giving him a snack from my drawer and asked if he could have snacks in his drawer too. My brother is shitty with me that I’m willing to give his kid a snack and not his own brother. I explained to him that he had lost my trust the moment he had decided to take my snacks when we were younger and that a 5yo kid is not going to be able to get food themselves and that i was doing my job in making sure he was fed and cared for\n",

I had already spent $15 on gelato plus at least $5 at starbucks. The hot dog place I only stopped at because it was a really good deal and I was hungry because she had chosen gelato over the fry & burger place earlier.

Another groomsman, Bob, didn’t pay for the Airbnb at all.\n",

Recently my brother Tim and his 3 kids (Bessy, who is 9, Jimmy, who is 11, and Timson, who is 13) spent the weekend here while Tim's wife was working and my husband and I were going camping.\n",

      "As of recently, Jimmy has had a bit of an interest in money. He celebrated his 11th birthday last month and did not hesitate to show everyone in the family his \"savings\" which he accumulated from pocket money and his birthday money. I did not realise that his interest in money extended to my coin collection which I keep in one of the spare rooms, and when we got home on Sunday, I found Jimmy and Bessy playing shopkeeper with some of my previously uncirculated shillings. Jimmy bragged about the fact that he \"found\" my shillings, but he stopped when I told him those were rare coins and that they were actually my belongings and not his to keep. \n",
      "\n",
      "He gave me the shillings back, and upon inspection I realised he had **polished them.** I asked him what he did and he said he accidentally touched them after eating without washing his hands but it was okay because he brushed them clean with soap and water. At this point I got a bit cross and tried to explain that his polishing of my rare coins made their value plummet but Tim stepped in to defend Jimmy saying \"You can't get too mad at him, he's only 11 and he just loves money. Surely the coins can be restored.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I was really not happy about this and explained to Tim that Jimmy removed about £200 from the value of my coin collection by doing this, and he started to get mad at me and asked whether I cared more about my coin collection or my nephew. I was not going to be berated in my own home and so I told Tim and his kids they had to vacate the house early and I was going to need an apology letter from Jimmy before I would feel comfortable having him as a house guest again.\n",

I called Tim and he told me that Jimmy, Bessy, and Timson were playing with it at the beach but it got lost. At this point I am furious because that coin was worth a lot of money and I said that Tim would have to replace the coins that his kids either lost or vandalised before they would be welcome in my home again. Tim told me that he didn't have the money to do that because he needed that money to buy Jimmy a new phone and I said that I didn't care and I would report it as theft if the coins were not replaced.\n",

      "Body text: When my grandma died, she left (roughly) $1,000,000 to my mother (66F), and $350,000 each to me (28M), my brother (38M), and my sister (30F).\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom didn’t really need the money she received, so she asked if I’d be okay with her giving $500,000 each to my brother and sister so they could buy houses outright. The deal was I’d get my $500,000 when she dies, and then the rest of her assets would be split three ways. I agreed, since I still live with my mom due to depression and anxiety, and didn’t need the money right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my brother and sister used up most of their $850,000 each (the $350k from grandma + $500k from mom) to buy their houses. I invested my $350,000, and after one year, it’s already made about $50,000 in profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, I realized that $500,000 today won’t be worth the same by the time I actually get it, years from now. I talked to my mom about it, and she agreed that adjusting the amount for inflation was fair. She changed her will so I’d receive the future equivalent of $500,000 in today’s money and not just a flat $500,000. We didn’t tell my siblings about this update. We figured it wasn’t a big deal unless it came up, and didn’t want drama if they disagreed. But we also weren’t going to lie about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, yesterday it came up. My mom casually mentioned it to my brother, and he got angry. He called me “devious” for hiding it. He argued that if my investments continue to grow at the same pace, I could end up with over $1,000,000 in profit in 20 years, way more than what they’ll gain from their houses. He thinks the $500,000 I get later shouldn’t be adjusted, because my investment growth makes up for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also argued that they had to use all of their $850,000 to buy places to live, while I get to live at home basically for free, aside from paying bills, and can just let my money grow. But technically, they could’ve chosen to live at home too if they wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, my brother told our mom to change the will back, and when she asked me, I just said “fine.” I didn’t want to fight and strain the relationship with him, or with my sister, if she finds out and takes his side. \n",

      "Body text: A close friend of mine has been caring for their mother with dementia for six years, and he has numerous siblings and family members in the area that could help, but simply don't. We are young, his mother had early onset dementia. It got me thinking so I have been poking around and trying to have the hard conversations with my own siblings about our parents since they are getting older. Sure they are fine now but hey anything can happen. So I asked hey, say either one or both our parents need help in the future would you help or would you just leave me to handle it on my own. I am the youngest, and I had the more chill parents. After going through it four other times they kind of had a hands off approach for me. so our childhoods were very different. Either way each of them said no they probably would not because they have their own families to worry about. Which is fair and I respect that choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where I may have made my mistake, I told our dad. Now he pretty much wants to write all of us out of his will, and reallocate everything into their own retirement. Grandkids college funds, he wants to opt out of paying for my sisters wedding she recently got engaged. To be honest, I don't think it is a bad idea in theory, but my dad tends to go scorched earth. He has no middle point it is either 0 or 100.  I mean my siblings know it was me and yeah they have been letting me have it. I have tried to explain it was not my intention, but I did feel it is something our parents should know so no one is caught with their pants down. \n",

      "The reallocation of funds also impacts me, our father set up two funds for each of us expect my sister she got three. One was college, and  one was a down payment for a house.

I do not have kids so technically it impacts my brother's more cause our parents did setup accounts for their college., \n",

However we had our daughter’s graduation this past week- secondary school so kids all age 18/19. Really lovely ceremony at the school, it was 2 hours long and as we walked out of the school hall - on school grounds he started vaping immediately. I told him to stop, not appropriate to be doing that in the school, he was really annoyed at me and told me it wasn’t a big deal and to forget about it. I just feel it’s not ok and was wrong of him, we spoke about it later and he said that he is addicted to vaping and it’s his only ‘vice’. I don’t know if I am overreacting or if others would feel the same. \n",

      "Body text: I (22F) and my friends (22F, 22F) have gotten into hiking recently. It is admittedly more my hobby and they aren’t as interested as me, but we do enjoy hiking together. However, we have different preferences in hikes. I like longer, smaller, natural trails with some elevation gain (look at the AT for examples). My friends like short, flat, gravel trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re passive in the trail selection process, so I usually pick a trail I think we’d all like and they either give me a ‘No way’ or an ‘OK’. I’ve tried to give them the opportunity to actively select the trails, but they never actually end up sending any trails into the groupchat, so I’m left the night before the hike trying to find hikes and let them give me the OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks ago, they finally chose a hike, and it was a completely flat gravel trail. It was pretty, of course. On the hike, my friends kept joking about how this was a good trail because I always chose hard trails (I choose beginner trails and always explain the trail conditions before they agree on the trail). One friend said if I chose that week’s trail, we’d be on the side of a mountain (We’re in Appalachia… most of our trails are on the side of a small mountain).\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m good at taking digs, but I wasn’t sure if they were actually mad at my choice in trails or not, so I asked them. One friend said she just hated hard trails and wanted to enjoy nature, not exercise. We talked it out and decided we’d all take turns picking trails to be fair. Last week, they picked another short, flat trail. We had a lot of fun. This week however they decided they didn’t want to go because it was my turn to choose a hike and I’d choose a ‘hard trail’. I told them the trail I was going to choose was a gravel trail with a very easy grade (its a popular trail for elementary school field trips). They still said no.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went hiking on my own. I decided to do a trail I’d been putting off because my friends wouldn’t like it - an ~8 mile hike up a mountain and back. And I went early in the morning so I’d watch the sun rise at the summit. I took photos, and when I got back, I posted them. My friends blew up the groupchat after they saw the photos and got mad that they weren’t invited because the view was beautiful and ‘its OUR hobby’. We argued for a bit and I just stopped replying after a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I was in the right because to me, they sound a bit crazy, but when I told my mom and sister, they said it was rude of me to go without them because ‘if you start a hobby with friends, you only do that hobby with friends’. And my sister does NOT like my friends, which is why I’m doubting myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "so AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "eta: they felt ‘left out’ of such a beautiful hike, but they made plans today (i did the hike this morning) and didn’t invite me, so they basically just wanted me to sit around doing nothing while they hung out. lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "edit 2: We’ve decided not to pursue hiking together as a group anymore. I’m distancing myself from them for a bit too. Yes, I took safety precautions on my solo hike. No, I don’t think I’m ‘better’ than other hikers.\n",

Then he told me, he is only planning on paying for himself. Leaving me to pay for my daughter and myself. Wich is a big difference moneywise to the 50/50 agreement we previously made. He now tells me he thinks its not up to him to contribute paying for my daughter.\n",

I worked hard, got a college scholarship, and now I'm a fairly successful self-employed software developer and have built a substantial amount of savings and recently bought a new home with cash. This was the result of a lot of financial discipline and hard work over several years. It was a lonely road because nobody in my family tried to help me, especially during the two years that I was in and out of homeless shelters. In fact, all of them refused to help because they disagreed with my \"lifestyle\". In case you need clarification, I'm a gay man and my family is deeply religious.\n",

      "Recently, my aunt (in her late 50's) called me out of the blue. She wanted to see if I'd be interested in having lunch with her. Because of how random it was, my head immediately went to \"oh, she's gonna pitch me an MLM\" cause it had all the hallmarks of an MLM pitch. But since we hadn't been in touch in over a decade, I wanted to see her. Surprisingly, we just had a normal lunch. And then she took me out for coffee and dessert...\n",

      "But I knew she wasn't just doing this for shits and giggles. I know my aunt. I knew she wanted something and was trying to sweeten me up... So I cut to the chase and asked her point blank - why did you call me here? She did all this because my cousin (27M) needed help. What help? Financial help. He was knee deep in sports betting debt... and when I say knee deep, I mean \\~$50k deep. And to make matters worse, he was maxed on several credit cards totaling to \\~$35k. And that's not where it ended. He was also upside down on his car note (\\~$38k) was 2 payments behind (\\~$1,600). At 27 years old, this man child had managed to rack up over $100k in debt.

What's to say my cousin wasn't going to go right back into debt after I pay everything off for him? And then they were going to reach out to me again? I saw them do this to my eldest aunt (she also deaded the extended family like I did) and this eldest aunt was the one who warned me and told me to never ever get involved if I want to keep my sanity intact. My eldest aunt actually passed away a while ago and she donated all her money to her local public school's music program because she knew that money would actually be put to good use (rather than squandered by her siblings).\n",

      "Then I heard a voice behind me. It was another mother telling her child to get on the ride with my child...the ride I had paid for for MY child. Her child was stood next to the ride and about to get on and I said absolutely not. My child was getting upset as they wanted the ride to themselves and then the other child started crying because I wouldnt let them on. \n",

      "The other mum went absolutely mental at me. Screaming at me that I'm being selfish for not letting her child on with my child and started to suggest that it was because her child was a different race?!?! \n",

      "She then noticed that I had been filming my child on the ride and was  \"concerned\" that her child was now in my footage . She demanded to see the footage and that I delete it if her child was in it. She tried to take my phone off me. I point blank refused I am SUPER CAREFUL when filming to ensure I don't film other children as I would prefer that my children don't end up on social media etc. The ride was against a wall so when I started filming, there was no chance (I thought) of capturing footage of another child. She tried to take my phone off me so i put it away in the inside pocket of my coat . I turned away from her and asked her politely to leave as she's scaring my child. \n",

      "Body text: A little backstory for context: I unfortunately fell into drug use at the age of 14 and have struggled to maintain sobriety until my sister fell pregnant and her daughter was born. That was a year and a half ago and since then I have not used because my sister gave me an ultimatum. The ultimatum was that I either choose drugs, our I choose to be in my nieces life. Obviously I choose the latter! That ultimatum ended up saving my life, so I feel in debt to my sister for that. \n",
      "Anyways, it has taken me a long time to gain back my family’s trust. Anybody who has gone through the early stages of getting sober knows that people will be suspicious of you and over analyze all of your behaviors, wondering if you’re high. Well, luckily, I have gotten past that stage and my relationship with my family is great. Especially with my sister. We are more like best friends than sisters these days. I get to see my family on a regular basis and things feel like they’re back to “normal”. \n",
      "OK, so this is where the conflict comes in… I have an aunt who does not yet fully believe that I am sober. We were texting and I sent her a text that was supposed to say “yes ma’am”, but instead it said “yes, mama”. All because of that, she believes that I am back on drugs. I told my sister about the situation and she tells me well you do look high and I don’t blame our Aunt for thinking that. \n",
      "My sister knows that this is a touchy subject for me. I’m very sensitive to how people perceive me. I work so hard at my recovery that when people don’t believe me, I do feel a little bit of heartache and she of all people knows that. \n",
      "I went completely silent, packed up my bag and told her I have to go. I said I’m not mad at you, but I feel so hurt and don’t want to stick around to hear anymore negative comments. \n",
      "My mother overheard the conversation and said that I was being childish and that I should just get over it and continue to spend the day with my sister like I had planned. I didn’t listen and I left. I told them I love them before I close the door to let them know that I am not angry. \n",
      "They are very angry with me now and I don’t understand why. \n",
      "So, am I the asshole for leaving my sister’s house when we had plans after she agreed with my aunt and said I looked high? \n",

      "Body text: My (21f) parents got divorced when I was 16. A few years later my dad met a woman and they got married last year. This past week was their first wedding anniversary and I received an angry call from my dad saying how he was disappointed when he didn’t receive any sort of gift from me or my siblings. I’m posting here because I personally don’t feel like I’m obligated to give him or my step mom any sort of gift (other than maybe a card). I’m close with my dad but he lives a few states away and he met my now step mom after I moved away to college. My siblings also live with my mom pretty much full time except for a few weeks in the summer so I wouldn’t really call them close either. My step mom is a nice enough woman and I buy her gifts for Christmas and her Birthday but I don’t feel the need to buy something for her anniversary when 1) we aren’t close and 2) I don’t feel that an anniversary is something that outside parties need to buy presents for.

A few months later I began dating \"Samantha\" (44f), and after several months of dating, I asked if she might be interested in joining me. I offered to cover for the flights (around $950) if she covered whatever increased costs there would be for adding a person (around $580).  Two months prior to the cruise, she realized she was dealing with too much on both her professional and personal life and couldn't manage a relationship and ended things. It sucked, but I let her know I'd see about getting her money back from the cruise.\n",

She then made several statements that seemed to essentially accuse me of taking advantage of her because I was holding a grudge or something.  I was thrown aback and pointed out that a lot of travel entities have cancellation fees. There's money I'm out on as well (like her train tickets which were fully non-refundable).  I don't think I owe her anymore - it's not like I'm coming out ahead and withholding her money from her, but the whole \"it's the right thing to do\" has me second-guessing myself.\n",

We’ve literally shared food and beers and stuff. It’s not like I used his toothbrush.\n",

      "Anyway. A couple days after he gets back, he texts me: “Hey, did you use my nail clippers?” I say yeah, sorry, had a split nail, cleaned them after, figured it was fine. He says “okay,” but then a little later he calls me and goes, “So… now there’s kind of a problem.”\n",

      "Turns out his girlfriend noticed they weren’t where she left them (???) and asked if he used them. He hadn’t.

      "So now I’m weirdly trapped in this lie he made up, even though I offered to tell her myself. I get that I didn’t ask first, but I genuinely didn’t think nail clippers were that personal.

      "Body text: Last weekend, I (27F) went on a 4-day trip to Madrid. On Friday, I met a guy in my hotel (let's call him Matt), who asked me out for lunch on Saturday. I said yes, and was quite excited for it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt chose a cute little outdoor cafe/eatery (perfect), the vibes were there, and everything was flowing nicely. That was until a guy with a guitar showed up. I know I'm probably in a minority, but I don't like street performances. I'm on a date, or in this historical place, because I want to focus on the people I'm with and the setting I'm in. I don't mind if someone is doing their thing too (musically or otherwise), but I don't want to stop and watch them, and I certainly don't want them coming up to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, this guy approached, and just started singing (in English) and improvising a tune about me and my date. He even asked Matt our names so he could work them into the song. Matt seemed to be enjoying the performance, but I was just waiting for it to end and kind of annoyed we'd been interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about 5 minutes the guy finished, and then asked for a tip. Matt gave him one, but I politely declined, as honestly I would have paid for this not to have happened. The performer started getting upset with me, and then Matt started agreeing with him?? Saying we'd been given a really cool private experience and it's only right to tip the guy for it? I held my ground, but needless to say the date was ruined and we awkwardly rushed through the rest of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong? Like yes this performer gave us his time and effort into making a custom song, and he wasn't bad. But also, I didn't want or ask for it?? I wouldn't be doubting myself, except Matt otherwise seemed like a reasonable guy, and was VERY on the side of the street peformer. AITA?\n",

I said that's fine, but I still wanted to go & at that point started to plan the trip as a solo trip, but kept a few activities together on the back burner. He asked if he still decided to go if later if that would be ok.

      "I (30F) have been with my Husband, C (30M) for 8 years, married for 3. This is about my Mum, A (60F) ft. Stepdad, P (65M).\n",
      "\n",
      "Mum and I were very close when I was younger but I’d notice things like her saying how proud she was I’d been accepted to study abroad publicly. Then privately say ‘I can’t believe you’re leaving me’ and saying I couldn’t cope. I ended settling for a course nearby. When I left home she’d say how successful I was publicly and then in private say things like ‘I’m not a bad mum, why are you leaving’.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I met C things were great, the families all got on and we were all close. Sadly we lost his mum who was his best friend 5 years ago. In a lot of ways it broke C and it fractured my relationship with my mum.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to say it started small but no, within 2 weeks of her dying my mum had asked about inheritance and what C will get when my FIL/S-MIL dies (C’s parents were divorced and his mum never remarried). After this almost every conversation was about money and how everything was really hard/expensive. Any offers of help are refused but she won’t stop talking about money.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could have gotten over this but she also (imo) ruined our wedding. A year after we lost C’s mum we got engaged and realised we couldn’t imagine having a big wedding without her. Paired with family politics we decided to have a private ceremony abroad and a blessing at home. That way our loved ones would see us ‘get married’ but the actual day would be just for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mum lost it, tears, threats of ‘I’ll just turn up’ and emotional blackmail of ‘I’m not a bad mum, why don’t you want me there’. We also had P screaming down the phone because we’d ’made her cry and should be ashamed’. To keep the peace we said they could come, then they said they couldn’t afford it. We picked up half their bill and invited more guests so it wouldn’t just be them. This turned our low-key wedding into a whole stressful event.\n",
      "\n",
      "We lost friends, arguments about people coming alone who wanted plus ones or people feeling they should be invited but weren’t. I’m not placing all the blame on mum, but if we were allowed to get married alone none of these arguments would have happened.\n",

      "It’s been years but part of me still regrets it. I love my husband more than anything but our wedding is a sore spot. We don’t have photos up and I sold my wedding dress as soon as I could. We’re talking about renewing our vows just so we can do it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has come up a few times with mum because she hates we’re not as close and it always turns into tears and ‘I just really wanted to be there’ or ‘I’m not a bad mum, why didn’t you want me there’. She refuses to see our feelings or her part in it. I’d give anything to hear ‘we know it wasn’t what you wanted and we’re sorry but we’re so grateful’.

In truth, I feel no connection to any of my ancestors cultures - Japanese, German, Italian, Irish - and feel similarly “other” when Italian, German, or Irish culture is being discussed.

Do you ever plan on going to Japan!” I said, “I consider myself white, but yes, I am 1/4 Japanese. I don’t really think I’ll ever go to Japan, though, it’s not really my thing.” My friend kind scoffed and asked why it isn’t “my thing”. I talked about how I don’t speak the language, have no connection to the culture, look white and don’t fit in Japanese spaces, and am not necessarily interested in learning more. They said that I was being racist and invalidating the biracial experience by “white washing” myself and valuing whiteness over “my culture”.\n",

      "It wasn’t a big fight or anything, but I am left feeling confused. Like am I being racist? Idk. I genuinely feel like I don’t fit in in Asian spaces, and feel like a culture vulture anytime I’m engaging with anything Japanese. It’s had no bearing on my life, I feel likes it’s more problematic for me to suddenly start calling myself Japanese to anyone and everyone. Probably some internalized issue there but I didn’t think it was such a big deal. Any feedback appreciated. \n",

      "\n",
      "This past week, while I was pregaming for senior week at her apartment with her roommate (22F), who I am also friends with, we got really tipsy and opened the bottle. I didn’t think much of it, since I had bought it myself, it had been sitting there untouched for almost 6 months, and it didn’t seem like it would be missed. We opened it and realized it had gone off, and we didn’t even end up drinking it, so we left it on the counter and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 30 minutes later, she sent her roommate a message about the wine, saying that it was annoying to come home and see her stuff used and that it was being saved for her graduation party, which was all very reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend then sent me a long message saying the bottle had been a gift and that it was inconsiderate for me to open it without asking. I explained that I hadn’t considered it a gift, it wasn’t wrapped or given directly to her, it was just part of the things that I had brought and happened to be left at her place. Regardless, I felt bad and apologized profusely and offered to replace it, to which she responded that it was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assumed the situation had been resolved, so I texted her the night before graduation asking about our plans for pictures and arrival. Instead of responding, she said my actions “reeked of something bigger,” and that I had unresolved feelings about her boyfriend getting more credit for the party than I did. She said she didn't believe that there was no intention behind my action, and that I should have handled my feelings like an adult instead of opening the bottle out of spite.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I had made a comment like that after the situation blew up to her roommate. I said that it felt ungrateful that I was receiving a lecture about a $6 bottle of wine after doing the absolute most for her party and her boyfriend receiving most of the credit. That wasn’t something I had been stewing over for months, it was just a thought I shared in the moment because the situation felt out of proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time I opened the bottle, there were literally no thoughts in my head, period. I was tipsy and just assumed it was leftover. I didn’t even consider that she might have considered it hers or a gift. I absolutely did not open it as a statement or to make her feel disrespected. I explained this and apologized multiple times, but she kept saying my apology didn’t feel sincere and kept implying that I had some deeper issue I was refusing to admit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, it feels like this might be the end of our friendship. I’ve explained myself repeatedly, but the situation has spiraled so far beyond the original issue that it no longer feels like it’s about the bottle at all. I genuinely didn’t intend to cause harm, but now I’m wondering, AITA for opening the wine?\n",

      "She ended up getting us like make up and jewellery? I'm genuinely not a make up or jewellery person at all though, I thought it was something she'd know. I have been gifted make up and jewellery before and I've never touched them, it's such a waste.\n",

      "I told her that if she really knew me she probably would not get me (or my friend) that and that maybe we could return my gift since it wasn't something I wanted, I didn't want to be mean. She got a bit mad though, she said that 'there's some things you should just keep to yourself, why would you tell someone that went to get you a gift that you don't like it' and it confused me.\n",

When it's her birthday I always try to get her something she'd like from remembering like perfumes or things she uses, or sometimes I'd go diy and I'd make something.

He did apologize and say that she would be very welcome if she wanted to come. That is of course the nice thing to say, but to me it doesn’t really resolve the issue. I told him that. Also my girlfriend would not be reassured by it. I told him I would think about what I will do. \n",

      "Body text: I'm a teacher's assistant for special ed and I have two co-assistants. Let's call them Corie and Tina. Let's call our lead teacher Pen. So Corie only recently got moved into our classroom, however Tina has worked with her in the past in another classroom. This is Pen's and my first time working with her. Corie is the expectant mother in question. She is a very sweet girl and is cooperative when she's here. I say \"when she's here\" cause in all honesty, she's calls out a LOT. Now you're probably saying, \"we'll she's pregnant, give her a break.\" According to Tina, she's *always* had an attendance issue. Even before she was pregnant. Tina works as an assistant on the bus too, so often it all falls on me. Now Tina has health problems of her own, including cancer (not the terminal kind). Yet with her, we often have to *make* her go home when she comes in and she clearly shouldn't. She pushes herself more than she should, and she's even passed out in the past and had to leave in an ambulance. Now to be fair, Corie does have real excuses sometimes. This isn't her first pregnancy, but this one has been giving her more nerve pain. Just like we would with Tina, we do tell her to go home when she's in pain. She clearly does feel bad about putting so much on us, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a pattern and not fair to the rest of us. Now you're caught up. Onto the situation that sparked this post.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other day, Tina and I got a text from Pen asking us if we want to plan Corie's baby shower. That took us completely by surprise. Pen and Tina have worked together the longest, and Pen has never done anything like that for her. Tina recently graduated with her degree, which she worked her butt off for while balancing work, being a mother, AND not to mention her constant medical problems. She is a trooper in ways I can't even express. We were both invited to Tina's graduation party and Pen didn't even show up to that. I wanted to, but I was sick. Tina believes I was sick because I overworked myself covering for Corie (cause as you might've guessed, the couple weeks before she was barely here). So Tina has more personal feelings about all this. From my perspective, I don't really have anything against her personally. I just barely know her. PEN barely knows her. In my experience, baby showers usually fall on the expectant's family or close friends. Neither of which we qualify.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know from an outsiders perspective, it probably seems like Tina and I are just feeling sorry for ourselves and that we should have more compassion for a pregnant woman who's under a lot of stress and pain. We do. We don't want her to push herself and work when she shouldn't. We just feel it wasn't fair of Pen to ask us to do that when we're not friends and she's put us through a lot. If Corie doesn't have anybody else, then my heart goes out to her (I have no idea what her social life is like), but I just don't feel comfortable doing that for someone I hardly know.\n",

I said yeah so I asked my boss if I can leave early (supposed to be off at 5) and drove a half hour home to hurriedly pack and prep for the weekend trip.

The beds were bad memory foam twin mattresses, and I’m 6’5 so I just ended up sleeping on the floor both nights I was there. And even then there were multiple empty beds from people not showing. My 5’5 friends that invited me slept in a queen. I dont mind a concrete floor its great for the back but I see the discrepancy. I feel like this was sprung on me suddenly and had I known, I honestly would’ve opted to just stay at work and collect my money. I work construction and I was in OT hours so that 3 hours wouldve been almost $110 extra bucks on my check. He admitted it was last minute and sprung and offered to pay half of it but I still feel apprehensive. The other friends invited prior have no jobs, live with their parents still, ect.

I plan to have a talk with him when I get home, but it’s been a quiet car ride so far… Would I be the asshole if I told him I felt like I didnt need to pay? Part of me is saying I was just a 3rd string friend to him but the other part of me wants to preserve things. I hate that I’m even in this situation cause I try not to get myself into this, I purposely don’t go out much, rarely vacation, and slave away most of every hour.

She typically just gives the silent treatment until she feels better instead of talking it out.

Then she said “no, I just had a really bad day yesterday and my feelings were hurt but I’m over it and I’m not talking about it”. When I asked her why she just said “because (MIL)!” and stormed away from me. I’m so confused.

A friend of ours wanted to order some items online but was being charged a ridiculous handling fee and 15% commission. I ordered the items for half the handling fee and didn’t charge any commission. That’s when my sister proposed the idea of starting a small personal shopping business. We could make money by increasing item prices and adjusting handling fees per kg. We brainstormed together and saw real potential. \n",

      "By last week, we started making moves. She spoke to our course mates, and I began designing a logo and poster, reaching out to my friends in other universities since it’s a student-focused business. On Thursday she suddenly said there was a change of plans and since she came up with the idea, profits would be split 60-40. I reminded her she only thought of the business after I helped her friend. She insisted she would’ve come up with it regardless and stuck to her 60%. I tried explaining that I was doing most of the work but she kept going. Since Friday, I took matters into my own hands. I finished the logo, picked a brand name, finalized the poster, made an Instagram page, and texted my friends to help advertise. \n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, she barged into my room not to comment on the page, but that my handling fee was too low. For context, I raised the base price by €1/kg. She yelled that I didn’t have a business mind and told me to raise it to €4.5. I told her I needed to give people a reason to trust our service and would increase prices later and that I also added a 3% commission. \n",

      "Again, she said it was too small and told me to change it to 8%, update the poster and post it. At that point, I asked her why she was telling me what to do with my business when she did nothing. She called me a thief, said I stole her idea and her customers. I told her I wouldn’t take orders from our course mates since she’d already spoken to them and that she should focus on setting up her business. Then she said the only way I could continue was if I took my business outside our uni. I refused since our school has over 25,000 students & is the perfect base.

We went to McDonald’s, and I was planning to pay for her, but when we got to the counter, she said something like “Oh, I can pay for myself.” I wasn’t sure if she was just trying to be independent or polite, so I said “Oh okay,” and then (this is the part I may have messed up) I said “Do you just wanna Apple Pay me then?” since I thought she was still letting me cover it.\n",

      "I (F38) am in an argument with my mother (F70) after some comments she made about my weight. I am currently 25+ weeks pregnant and I have an obvious baby belly. So far my pregnancy has been very good and my daughter seems to be growing fine, no complications or difficulties. I still work fulltime and work out twice a week (pilates). This is my first pregancy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I have gained weight during the pregnancy. I started around 54 kg (120 lbs) and I think I've gained about 9 kg so far (20 lbs). I am 1.64m or 5'4\" in height. My starting BMI was healthy as far as I know. My weight gain so far is also in the normal range if I look it up online. I've been to all my check-ups and not once have I been asked how much weight I've gained by my doctors. In fact, they did not even weigh me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, my mother has been making a lot of comments about how big I am becoming. It started with comments how my belly was \"starting  to fill out\" and that my \"chest has gotten really big\". These unwanted comments already irritated me, but I didn't react.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was the final straw. I had gone on holiday and borrowed some clothes from my mom. Today I brought some of it back, and I was wearing a tighter shirt than normal (a pre-pregnancy shirt) and pregnancy jeans. \n",

      "When I walked in the door, one of the first things she said was how I was \"swelling up\",  referring to my belly. Then she proceeded to ask me (again) how much weight I had gained (I had dodged the question before). When I answered, she replied in a very shocked tone, \"Oh wow that is so much! Do you know the more precise number? You should step on our scale\". \n",

      "I declined the offer and changed the subject, but afterwards I got so mad with her constant nagging about my weight that I called her and told her my weight was perfectly normal and that I would stop visiting her if she kept making comments about it.

This made me more mad and I hung up the phone. \n",

However I’ve really been struggling with the fact he hasn’t been working.

I think I need some time from speaking and spending time together.\"\n",

She started to ask me to do my own laundry and help around the house and dont get me round i dont mind helping around the house and all, but its weird because she also wanted me to clean my brothers apartment. We live alone me and my mom and my brothers live in the apartment next door. Like i said before my brothers are much older so you would think they do things by themselves but no, my mom still cooks for them, buys them groceries, does their laundry, cleans their place and a bunch of other things. My issue is she loves to do it for them but for me it seems like its too hard of a job...for example when i come home from work at like 7pm she already cooked for my brothers and everything but then she asks me to make myself something even tho she was home for hours and cooked for them why cant she just like cook a little more and cook for me too? Or her reasoning why my brothers dont do anything and I'm supposed to do everything is because they're boys and I'm a girl so its like my duty to do so?? Like what?? So because all of that i stay in my room most of the time and don't even talk to all of them that muh anymore cause i just had enough, and when they get mad at me they say \"oh you used to be so nice back then and now you're just a unfriendly person\" and whatever and \"oh you're alway in your room on ur phone that's why no one talks to you\" mind you I'm very nice and friendly outside. But yea I don't know AITA for acting the way i do after all these years of the same treatment??\n",

      "Body text: I (23M) had asked my roommate let's (24M) if he wanted to a camping trip just the two us and he agreed. For context we have 3 other roommates and rarely get time just the two of us. He also doesn't work unlike the rest of us, because his parents are wealthy and pay for all his expenses. My roommate because of this can do whatever he pleases all day. He also has a lot of short term relationships (male and female) and often will bring them to group hangouts. When the day of the trip came I drove us both to the parking lot of the campground and we both grabbed our own things we had packed. All he had packed was one backpack with clothes and hygiene products.I get that he comes from a wealthier background but he complained for the entire walk which was less than a quarter of a mile, and he only had to make one trip. I had asked him if he could help me get the rest of the stuff but he refused which I was ok with because I didn't expect him to. I had to make around three trips because I admit I had overpacked a bit because I wanted both of us to have a good time especially my roommate because he had only ever been camping as a young kid in a camper and didn't remember it that well. An example of one of the things I packed was a few of those packets that you put in a fire to make it colorful.  By the time I got back from the second trip I noticed he was on his phone which I didn't really mind. I was setting up the tents (two two person tents) when I saw a girl with pink hair coming near holding a Tupperware. I thought she was staying in one of the other tents but then she went up and kissed my roommate. Turns out she was my roommate's latest girlfriend (19 F) who was also a baker and she had made a bunch of cupcakes which was what was in the Tupperware. Apparently when my roommate had been on his phone he had been inviting her to come with us. Now I haven't mentioned this yet but I am a very optimistic person and my friends will jokingly call me a boy scout because of it. Being me I decided to make the most of the situation and welcomed her even though I was a bit hurt my friend invited her without telling me. For the next two days I was third wheeling hard, but I didn't say anything. One night when I was sleeping I could even hear them going at it in the other tent so I decided to take a walk wade in a nearby creek. My roommate must have decided to take a walk too because soon he was there too. We talked casually and he decided to ask me why I wasn't my usual upbeat self. I thought it I had been covering up how upset I was well, turns out I hadn't. I told him it was nothing but he kept pestering me until I ended up yelling at him that I was upset about him bringing his girlfriend on the trip without telling me. He was quiet for a moment before telling me that I was just jealous he could get a girlfriend.  At that moment I decided to walk away and hide in my tent. It's the next day and I feel bad for yelling at him, but I genuinely felt upset at him. So AITA?\n",

      "\n",
      "I (21F) am graduating university this year in August. My school is an international one with campuses in three different countries. I decided to travel abroad to the campus in the UK for the opportunity to live there and travel Europe during my studies. I’ve never even stepped foot on any of the other campuses (including the stateside one). \n",
      "\n",
      "Now here’s the issue. My dad has debt—most notably, child support. I didn’t think it was insane, but I’ve learned from one of my younger brothers that it might be way worse than I thought. I’ve learned over the last two or so weeks that he (according to this brother) owes about $50,000 to his mom, and every time he’d come up with a payment plan, he’d always default. This is something that I had to believe because it was the same with my mom until they settled at a MUCH lower rate than what he owed her because my mom needed the money (3k instead of somewhere around 10k). \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also call me a bit bitter because him defaulting on payment plans for my mom made her fall behind on bills that the payment plan would have paid, and she was the one using her credit to get parent plus loans. In the end, she was unable to secure the final loan needed for my tuition (though incompetence in my school’s administration has a large part to play as well—long story for another time).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, this debt has barred him from getting a passport. He went to the courts and they said no in the end—even for a temporary one. Now I’ll do what I can to help on that front such as letters and the like, but the one thing I don’t want to do is move my graduation stateside just so that he’ll be able to attend. Call me selfish or mean, but to me, it feels like the consequences to his actions.  \n",

And my grandmother keeps telling me how sad it makes her that he won’t be able to be there. \n",

She wants my mom and I to fly out for the weekend shes having it, basically we would only be there one full day. Tickets would be $400-600 for the two of us and neither of us really wants to pay that especially for such a short trip. My mom mostly lives check to check, and my savings are going quick trying to start my own business. I should note we are already going out there in October when the baby is due to see her. My sister has been constantly asking my mom about it, telling her to just save for it but thats hard to do, especially since we still have to payoff the house were staying in in October. Not only that but when things dont go how she wants she has a habit of guilt tripping or holding things over our heads, making my mom feel awful. Shes my older sister, but Ive learned to not let her pay for anything because itll come back on me later. Plus I cant help but feel if she chose to be so far away, she should expect we wont be able to make it for every milestone. \n",

      "Nothing prepares you for the grief you feel when you discover your intuition was right all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 2 years, my son (16) has been shifting away from me. This is more than your typical teenage moody angst. It was like he hated me with every fiber of his being. He would go to his dad’s for his every other weekend visit and return to my home with seething anger. It worsened with time and by last fall, he became physically intimidating towards his sisters and me to the point I had to call the police. Dad refused to discuss anything with me and I had this unsettling feeling that there was a plot developing. By December, my son caused so much upheaval in my home I finally relented to his demands to go live with dad. I have plenty of reasons why I’ve been against the idea of my son living with his dad but that’s for another time. Within a month of my son going to dad’s and without a single conversation between dad and me about the situation per his choice, dad had me served for full custody of my son only- not his sisters. Dad fabricated a 27 reason argument why he is a better fit to have full custody and I agreed without contest because of the pure hell my son put his sisters and me through. I asked and was awarded a temporary order only with a stipulation to reconvene in 30 days after my son attend therapy, which dad was vehemently opposed to prior to court. With therapy ordered and taking the advice of my lawyer, I began nurturing the broken relationship between my son and I. It took months of cautious interactions beginning with just a few hours and gradually working our way up to longer periods of time. The stipulated order was extended another month and a half in order to allow additional time for my son to meet with his therapist on a regular basis. Then, suddenly, it all changed. My son completely reverted back to a version I hadn’t seen in nearly 2 years and the complaints about dad came at an overwhelming pace. I knew something had been off for the last couple years and my gut told me what I knew instinctively and it was confirmed last night when my son explained the scheme dad and he calculated in order for dad to take custody. Even down to setting me up for extreme reactions to my son’s bad behavior so they could claim my home was full of conflict. What my son doesn’t know is this all came on the heels of a 14 month long child support review where his dad did everything you can imagine to reduce his child support obligation (he’s a 1099 iykyk) but I hired a CPA investigator to minimize the impact of his lies. Now his dad and him are at odds. The mama bear in me wants to rescue my son and bring him home but the betrayal and effects of what my son has done is so deep that I don’t think I can ever trust him enough to let him come home. And while I knew in my soul what was happening, it was the hope that I was wrong that kept me going. \n",

      "Body text: I (37F) was recently at my MIL's (73F) house, along with SIL (40F), my husband (38F), and my daughter (7F). We were helping her unpack items from a storage unit for summertime. Many of her items are wrapped in old newspaper, many of which come from her home country in South America. My husband was not at the table with us, as he was driving back and forth from the storage unit.\n",

      "My daughter and I are white. \n",
      "\n",
      "While my daughter was unwrapping, she found a newspaper from around 2017 or so. There was a small comic that showed a drawing of a gorilla and a caption that said, \"Meghan Markle.\" She asked me what it meant, and I explained that Meghan Markle is a famous Black woman, and that the \"joke\" was not funny at all, but actually extremely racist. I said whoever wrote it should be ashamed of themselves. We talked a bit about how it's dehumanizing and some of the history behind it. My daughter understood and called the comic \"horrible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, my MIL snapped that I simply didn't understand her country's culture and that I was making huge assumptions that were far outside my knowledge as a privileged American. She said that I was being unfair and unnecessarily denigrating her country in front of her granddaughter, who has not been able to visit yet. I responded sincerely that what I said had nothing to do with Country, and that I've seen the same sorts of jokes (and worse) in the United States as well. But racist is racist and should be called out as such, no matter where the joke is from. My MIL then insulted me in Spanish and stormed off, and my SIL followed her, after telling me that I should \"stay in my lane\" and keep my criticisms of her mother's beloved homeland to myself. I could hear them loudly talking about me for the next couple hours. My daughter cried and felt like it was her fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, my husband was mostly on my side, and said the joke was \"obviously\" racist. But he also said I should have realized that his mom is defensive about her country since things have not been great there lately (politically) and she is so homesick. I should have known that it would be hairtrigger to anything remotely critical and should have told our daughter that I would explain later, and in private.\n",

      "Body text: My (25M) roommate \"Trevor\" (also 26M, not his real name) and I have been friends for years. This is our second apartment together, and over the years, I’ve heard countless stories about his mom “Janet” and her controlling behavior. I used to think he exaggerated — stuff like her wanting access to his bank accounts, or choosing his shampoo for him. But since moving into our current place 6 months ago, I’ve seen a lot more of it firsthand.\n",

      "The breaking point came this week — over their family cat, Koybie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevor sometimes house-sits for his parents, and the cat has always had issues: feline herpes (can’t be around other cats), anxiety (he’s medicated), and recently some dental issues. Trevor went over last night while his parents were out of town. I called to see if he wanted dinner, and he sounded really off. That’s when he told me: Janet had decided to put Koybie down — in two days. This was probably his last night with the cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her reasoning? Koybie had peed on the carpet too many times, and the vet apparently told her that because of his age (10), it wasn’t worth doing dental surgery. She also didn’t want to replace the carpet again if it didn’t fix things. Trevor was crushed. He grew up with this cat. He told me he’d already offered to pay for the surgery, and I offered to chip in too — but Janet said no. She had already made the appointment and refused to budge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doug\" (Trevor’s dad) won’t go against her either. Trevor says he just stays quiet to avoid conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I looped in Trevor’s girlfriend and a mutual friend in a group chat. We all agreed that Koybie didn’t deserve this. I offered to take him into our apartment temporarily (despite the “no pets” rule) to buy time to rehome him. Trevor eventually agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 9 p.m., we went to his parents’ place and packed up everything — food, meds, toys, beds — and brought Koybie to our place. I suggested Trevor text Janet so she wouldn’t come home to an empty cat bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That might’ve been a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "She *flipped out.* Hundreds of texts. Accusing Trevor of hurting Koybie more by moving him, saying his anxiety made this dangerous, that we were being irresponsible and cruel. She said the vet and a local shelter had *both* recommended euthanasia (???), threatened to call the cops, and even told Doug she’d divorce him when he asked her to give Trevor and I a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also told Trevor that I was a “bad influence” and manipulating him into “stealing” the cat.\n",

      "Body text: So, I have been going to the gym around 5 days a week for 2.5 years now. Sometimes I go solo, and regularly I ask a friend to go together. My girlfriend wasnt really into fitness like me, and even when she did join me (with a day pass) she would quickly want to go home because she didnt want to anymore.\n",

So, I have a ‘basic’ model gym membership, which gets you unlimited access to the gym. But since she wanted to go too, we decided I would get a premium membership, which would allow me to invite one friend everyday to come with me. This gym also has several locations in our area. \n",
      "\n",
      "So day 1, we would go to the gym together, and she already tells me she doesnt want to go to the gym location I prefer the most. So we go to another location nearby. When we workout, she mostly does cardio on the threadmill and stairmaster, and I do weights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Day 2, my school finishes at 2:30, her work at 4:00, so she wanted to go to the gym at 04:30, even though i prefer going in the evening, after relaxing a bit and eating a good meal for energy. We still went at 04:30 but what i realized, is she gets annoyed quickly when my workout isnt done as quick as hers, because she does cardio and i do weights. So i tell her it annoys me because I am the one inviting her with my membership, even though she offered to pay the extra costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day 3. Same thing. And i call her to tell her, that if she only goes gym for cardio,and maybe lifting weights once a week, its better to switch to the in-between-membership, where i can invite someone once a week. And the other days we could go skating or padel for cardio. Even though i told her in the past i dont rlly do cardio because im focussed on gaining weight.\n",

He has somewhat long fur and occasionally, after he poops, he gets a bit stuck on his bum, but this is infrequent and we generally catch it and can clean him before he makes a mess. My friend is a bit of a clean freak to point that we suspect undiagnosed OCD. He's been keeping his headset, mousepad, and wired mouse tucked away near the couch on the floor. Two days ago, the cat had a bit of poop on his bum and got it on the fabric mouse wire. My friend has tried his best to clean it, but insists it still smells like cat poop and is no longer willing to use it. He's even admitted that even if he wasn't able to smell it anymore, he'd probably still be too paranoid to use it.\n",

If my friend paid rent or had been here in the short term, I'd also be more open to this. My parents (who co-own the condo I live in with me; I pay them rent) wanted him to move out at the end of March, which he had agreed to. He failed to meet this deadline and now I am letting him stay still without telling my parents. I'm a PhD student and I barely break even every month, so I don't have the extra money to spend. He's unemployed, but he's also not trying to get a job. He doesn't intend to stay forever, but he's stagnated. \n",

But given the context that I'm barely breaking even and generously letting him stay in my one bedroom condo rent-free, it doesn't seem fair to ask me to replace an item *that isn't actually broken*. I pay my parents $1300 per month, which is not that pricey given my area, but cost of living is very high. I feel like by letting him live here rent free, I'm essentially giving him $750 per month. To give him more money on top of that doesn't feel fair. \n",

      "Anyway my husband decided that weekend he wanted to go for a bike ride with a group of buddies on Sunday (Mother’s Day). He left around 12pm. I spent the afternoon and early evening with my mother and my family. Everything was going fine with occasional updates on his day. After supper that night I had headed home around 7pm, and I realized the power was out. Odd but sometimes that happens. I thought maybe he forgot to pay the bill (we’ve had issues in the past with our electric company) so I messaged him asking if he may have forgotten. He claimed he hadn’t. Come to find out some breaker blew for the whole block. I didn’t know it at the time since we live next to two abandoned homes and a school. Anyway it was starting to get really dark and as a woman in her early 20s I was starting to get uncomfortable staying at home alone at night with no power after our home was just broken into. I called my husband and asked if he would be willing to start heading home. He said no and I could handle myself. No worries…so I offered to pack up our animals and head back to my mothers. He flipped out at that suggestion calling me an idiot for wanting to leave our home unprotected after a break in calling me a pu**y. He told me he wasn’t coming home and I needed to figure it out but I wasn’t allowed to leave the house unprotected. He hung up and I called the electric company again and asked for an ETA. They said it would be later that night before anyone came out and suggested I find somewhere to stay and that I would get a phone call when the technician was there. So I called my husband again to give him the update and asked again if he would be willing to head home in about 30 minutes. I asked if we could maybe compromise and he lost it on me. Told me i was a pos for acting a fool and that he didn’t deserve me as a wife. He claimed he deserved better and he shouldn’t have to cut his 8 hour bike ride short and that he will come home when he’s ready. He hung up on me. I panicked and called my brother who ended up coming to stay with me until the power came back on. After my husband came home he looked right at me and said all I do is ruin his life and he was pretty much done with me after this. We ended up talking things out but He’s about to go out again this weekend and keeps telling me I better not ruin this one for him and to call someone else if something happens cause he will be busy.

      "I called her out later on how disrespectful and out of line it was to bring up my mom’s financial situation like that, especially in a conversation about something neither of them legally owns yet. That’s when my cousin butted in and said, “Let’s not get emotional,” which really rubbed me the wrong way because I wasn’t yelling or overreacting. I was setting a boundary. On top of that, my aunt brought up how she’s the one who has been taking care of my grandmother for the past few years when knowing my mother financially struggles and lives in a completely different state and doesn’t have the capabilities to take off from work and come to take care of our grandmother. (My aunt lives 25 mins away from her while my mom lives 12 hrs.) So she tried to guilt us into “I deserve more than 50/50.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, they immediately got ready to leave. (Before we brought up the car again as confirmation they said they’d come back with us and hang out with us because we haven’t seen them for awhile and drove 12 hours.) No goodbye, no follow-through on the “we’ll come back and hang out”. They just scattered the second the car discussion didn’t go their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel conflicted and hurt. Part of me thinks I had every right to defend my mom and speak up, especially because the comment about her finances was unnecessary and felt like a power play. But another part of me wonders if I was out of line for confronting my aunt in front of others or not just letting it slide for the sake of peace. My aunt often cusses out my mom or power plays her since she is way more better off in life while my mom has struggled as a single mother her entire life. My aunt knows all of this too.\n",

      "It doesn’t matter what the food is, there’s just always lip smacking. I’ve been intentional about eating when she doesn’t, but the way our office is situated, the kitchen is pretty open and we can hear/see when someone is having lunch. I once was eating noodles while she was working, and made a comment along the lines of “Ugh, I hate how loud it sounds when I eat noodles” within her earshot, and she (very kindly) said “Hey! No judgement here - eat as loud as you want”.\n",

I’m a fairly confrontational person, and wouldn’t mind mentioning it to her, but I can also see making any comment around coming across as hurtful/insensitive.\n",

It’s been pretty chill overall, and I’ve put a lot of work into improving the place, basically making our landlord’s investment look way better without much effort on their part.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month ago, one of my roommates, Eric (who’s lived here for 8 years), mentioned he and his wife (they got married about six months ago) were looking for a new place. He asked if they could stay here temporarily if they couldn’t find anything. I said *sure*, but only short-term, since I've had traumatic experience living with couples.\n",

      "Fast forward to two weeks later: Eric hosted a dinner with me, his wife, her kid, and another roommate, Jasmine excluding the fourth (Caleb, who’s rarely around since he has another place). At this dinner, Eric announced that his wife *and* her 18-year-old kid would be moving in. For context, we’re all in our 30s-40s, so this feels… odd. And Eric never had a discussion between all original roommate's collectively about this happening. Jasmine and I assumed this was temporary, until they bought a new fridge just for themselves. When I later asked about their timeline, Eric said *indefinitely*. I asked if rent would be adjusted to reflect two extra people. He said nah, the only concession was splitting utilities equally.\n",

      "Here’s the thing: None of us signed up to live with a whole family. I don’t want to teach a messy 18-year-old girl how to coexist with adults. Plus, the kid brought home a stray kitten without asking anyone. Lastly, as a male, I don't feel comfortable with a younger female living here. Eric's family now occupies the two rooms he's always had, but we all share common spaces and a single bathroom, and.... the landlord doesn’t know about the new occupants, which didn't seem like Eric was going to notify them about. And I don't want to lie to them... I'm trying to get the family to understand the implications but I fear they think I'm being aggressive about my concerns and don't want them there at all.\n",

It was packed- Myrtle Beach at the beginning of a 3-Day Weekend (and the beginning of Black Bike Week).  I was up near the front of the store, next to the deli. A Walmart employee was loading stuff from her cart, and was blocking off the passageway a bit. There was still plenty of room to pass, except an 60ish woman had parked her cart close the middle of the passageway. There was no room to pass on either side of her cart, and she was 6 feet away, back to her cart and looking at the deli meat display. Instead of bothering her, I just reached up and moved her cart about 12-18\" forward and went around her on the left. There was no purse or anything on the cart. \n",

My dad injured his knee and their dog needs carried down the steps to use the bathroom. I agreed, but, then my dad got a steroid injection in his knee and is doing much better. The issue is, now my own dog is gone, but I’m still cleaning up messes from their dog what feels like all day every day.

I can tell my parents are frustrated with me because I won’t keep him but I’m so overwhelmed and feel like I’m failing at all aspects of my life (work, parenting, etc) because of this. It’s leading to major depression and this is just kind of the final tipping point for me. I also understand the significant pressure they have on them so I do feel guilty.

      "Body text: This is my first time posting on this subreddit at the behest of my friend. She thought that you guys could let me know if I really am at fault here. I (27F) love my nephew (10M) very much. He's a very intelligent, kind, and sweet kid. He also has very unique interests for a boy his age, and his father (38M) disapproves of most of them. He's a good father, but he isn't very supportive of his son (we'll call him Andy). For example, Andy likes to crochet with me, but my brother Jared has told me privately to do other activities with Andy. But, he has never expressed his disapproval directly towards Andy. \n",

      "Andy's mother passed away a few years ago, and it's been hard on the family. We don't have much of an extended family as they live across the country, but I've been there to support Andy and his father (let's call him Jared) the whole time. I've been bonding more and more with Andy and learning more about his interests. Now, the trouble arose when Andy asked me to enroll him in our local community center's ballet classes. I think it would be a great opportunity for him, and I don't think that ballet is gendered. I did, however, have a sneaking suspicion that Jared would disapprove. I still enrolled Andy in the classes for the summer, and he is overjoyed. \n",

Andy is really excited about the classes, and I don't think he is aware of the conflict it has caused between his father and I. The classes are free, so Jared is not mad about the money, but I still feel like I have been duplicitous towards my own brother. \n",

      "So here’s the context. I (19F) have been preparing for medical entrance exams (NEET, in India) for the past 3 years. It’s been a tough ride, and I recently cleared one of the competitive exams, which means I can get into a private medical college—but here’s the catch: it’s extremely expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my parents do have the funds, but barely—it would wipe out most of their savings. That’s a massive thing, and I get that. The issue is: for the past three years, they kept giving me false reassurance like “Don’t worry, we’ll figure it out—even if it’s private, we’ve got you.” Naturally, I took that at face value. I worked hard, yes, but I did take a few breaks when I mentally crashed, and because of that, I didn’t get a full scholarship.\n",

      "Now, post-exam, things have flipped. Suddenly I’m being forced to prep for every other competitive exam I randomly applied to (none of which I’m passionate about, and none of which they ever mentioned seriously before this). They’ve shifted the goalpost and are now telling me I need to “prove I’m worth investing money into.”\n",
      "That hurt. For the first time, it felt like all the love and support was conditional. It felt like I wasn’t a daughter anymore—just a gamble they regret betting on.\n",

      "My mom especially has always made me feel “less than.” Since I was 13-14, she’s told me extremely heavy, inappropriate stuff—like graphic stories about her past with my dad, their failed abortions, violence, manipulation, and more. As a teen, I didn’t even know how to process all that, but I just nodded and listened because I thought that’s what “being close” meant.\n",
      "Today, she started going on about “boundaries” again. I was visibly upset and emotionally exhausted, and she said something like, “You can’t expect us to pay for college and also be upset about it. That’s selfish.” I finally snapped and said:\n",
      " “Don’t talk to me about boundaries when you told me about your failed abortions and your abuse when I was 13.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She started crying. Then she called me “ungrateful,” “a bastard,” “just like your father,” “worthless,” “self-centered,” “selfish,” etc. Classic silent treatment after that. And yeah, I ended up apologizing. I cried, too. I said, “I’m sorry—I don’t know what I was thinking.” But the thing is, I do know what I was thinking: I’ve always been put down. My confidence is shattered because of the way I’ve been raised. Every time I try to believe in myself, it’s them who mock me, criticize me, doubt me. I’ve internalized it. I can’t make a single decision without spiraling. But apparently, I’m the “selfish” one for reacting. I do feel selfish I am taking a huge amount of their money, their Saving and I still snapped like that , they aren't wrong for pushing me for other courses when I clearly failed trying to clear this one, idk I'm confused as hell\n",

So again, I finished the project and asked them to do the report. They said I “didn’t explain anything” and “took over,” even though I had walked them through it and sent everything.

      "6 months ago, my brother-in-law (37m) moved in with myself (29f) and my husband (31m) to get his s*** together and keep himself out of prison again. His girlfriend ( 44f) of 10 years, whom he has cheated on repeatedly and blatantly, decided to show up a couple of days later without a heads up. Mind you, this is like an 18-hour drive. One way. She came here with their dog, who has a very long track record of showing aggression towards other people and other dogs. She showed up with no car, no money, no plan, and no heads up. After constant fighting for a month, we bought her a bus ticket and sent her back home. We thought that was the end of that. The last I heard from my brother-in-law, he had told us that he had \"kicked her to the curb\" and that they were over. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cue 4 months later, I am awoken at 5:00 a.m. (with our 2 month old baby) by my husband. he tells me that the girlfriend is back in town. What is not made clear to me, is the fact that she is in my home sleeping. I am awoken, a few hours later to nurse my child. My first indication that this woman is in my home is her looking in my bedroom door at me nursing. My child. Creepy as hell. So, she gets her feet under her and starts a job a few weeks ago. In the meantime, my brother-in-law is getting himself into some trouble. He went to prison for drug charges (not surprising) and having a firearm in the vehicle (felon, unsure of where the firearm came from) long story short, he had to be bailed out to avoid permanent damage being inflicted onto this man for his very obvious gang tattoos on his face. Now, his car is impounded so his girlfriend is having to take my car for work. She works 50 mi away, which means 100 mi on MY CAR everyday. Now, he has decided that he is going to take her to work, come home, work at my house on yard work etc (no rent means help with chores) and then go back to get her. He is going to take way longer than he should, and I know that, which means he is more than likely going somewhere and getting high again. Am I the a****** if I tell my brother-in-law and his girlfriend and their dog to get out of my house? Keep in mind, while she was gone for 4 months their dog bit two people and made my brother-in-law go to court for one of the bites. He also has attacked a couple of dogs, and was not part of the deal of coming to live with myself and my husband. Not to mention, my brother-in-law had a known prostitute at my house repeatedly, told her to leave, and she called the cops on him saying that she was being beaten by him. I was home, he definitely was not touching her. But this shows the kind of company he hangs around with.\n",

The gf was only supposed to use my car until he got his car back which will be on Monday. BIL was actually doing great and on a very good path until his enabler of a gf came back. I had NO idea she was coming back. She has been here for I believe 3 weeks and actually IS trying to get her shit together. I have NO CLUE who bailed him out, I wanted him to stay in prison and maybe learn something and for the gf and dog to get tf out. \n",

So this woman gets on and then walks to the back of the bus where I am and just hovers in the aisle near my seat staring at me while the bus is going. I thought she was obviously odd and kinda ignored her and kept listening to my music.

      "Body text: I (26F) have always had a complicated relationship with my name. My family has always called me Lucy, as a shortened version of my middle name (Lucille) and I’ve never been called by my first name. This is super annoying and has led to me feeling kind of disconnected from my name and annoyed at the hassle of correcting people at doctor’s appointments and first days of school/work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 18, I had a falling out with my family over them disapproving of my sexuality (they are very Christian and I am gay) and I left home. During that time, I started going by a completely different new nickname that came from one of my friends and I got into a long term relationship with someone who only knew me by this new nickname. My ex and all of my new friends called me by this new nickname for long enough that I preferred it over either of my real names.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when I was 21 I got out of that relationship and was really hurt by it. My ex had been really controlling and it caused me to feel like I lost myself. At that point, I decided to stop using the new nickname that she called me and start going by my real name again. In that shift, though, I also decided that I preferred the spelling “Lucie” to Lucy. I am autistic and have weird positive/negative feelings about certain letters and numbers, so I’ve always preferred that spelling. I just figured that because it was still technically a nickname of my real name that it wouldn’t be a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except! It’s been several years now and all of my family members refuse to spell my name with an -ie. I have explained to them my reasoning, how I have always preferred this spelling and how I decided to use my real name again after leaving a controlling relationship where I felt like I’d lost my identity. They have all sort of made peace with my bisexuality and my atheism, so we have a decent relationship now, but they don’t respect my desire to spell my name differently!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, I have started pointing it out every time they do it. If they text me or write something about me with the spelling “Lucy,” I tell them that it’s spelled wrong. Last night, my mom told me that “Lucy” isn’t wrong and that I should give up trying to change it. All of my friends call me Lucie, my social media accounts say Lucie, my boss and co-workers call me Lucie. My family members are the only ones that won’t budge and I cannot understand why! It’s been literally five years and I love the new spelling, so I don’t think I’ll ever change my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know it sounds silly, but “reclaiming” my name by changing the spelling did a to help me get over my breakup and move forward in growing into myself. It hurts my feelings a lot that my family members won’t respect it, but I also understand that it might be a silly request and kind of meaningless to anyone but me.\n",

      "\n",
      "i don’t think it’s the end of the world if people spell my name wrong, but I do think it is nice for people to make effort with these sorts of things. I always do my best to remember other peoples’ names and spell them correctly because that kind of thing is important to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "i know that i’m not entitled to being called anything and that i can’t force anyone to spell my name any certain way, but i also don’t think i’m wrong to be annoyed (to reiterate: ANNOYED. it hurts my feelings some but im mostly annoyed and not emotionally shattered or whatever other dramatic thing lmfao) when people deliberately misspell my name. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should have also clarified that I sometimes feel as though my parents spelling my name with a -y is done deliberately knowing that it will annoy me. I have more of a problem with this than the spelling itself. i think that’s an important distinction.\n",

      "Body text: I (27F) moved in with my boyfriend (26M) and his roommate (26M) last year after 5 months of dating. At first, I paid utilities, cooked, and cleaned, but after we all moved into a new apartment, I started paying rent too—me and my boyfriend now cover more than half.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 3 months into our relationship, the roommate and his girlfriend of 3 years broke up. A year later, he started seeing a coworker (26F) who lived in another country and was recently engaged. She visited in January after her fiancé broke up with her, and we were initially happy for him. But things quickly got weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "During her first visit, she got very drunk, showed a married man her nudes, and joked about a foursome. That was my first red flag. Despite that, I was polite and even texted her after she left—she said she was with another guy in a different state. She continued visiting, and it just got worse. She’s constantly asking invasive questions (about our sex life, my boyfriend’s size, etc.), shows me nudes, and even asked me to make out with her. She often drinks heavily—like 5 nights a week—and acts inappropriately in front of everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started putting a major strain on my relationship. My boyfriend initially thought I was overreacting, but during a recent fight between us, she encouraged me to break up with him. That’s when he finally realized she was a problem.\n",

      "She also mimics me—buys the same things I have, copies my nail polish, and even wore a shirt of mine that her boyfriend had previously complimented. She’s sometimes okay, but something about her feels very off. It’s been exhausting mentally, though I’ve gotten better at ignoring her since she doesn’t live here full-time.\n",

      "Our roommate is smart, and it’s baffling to all of us why he’s with her. I feel hesitant to speak up because I moved in under nontraditional circumstances, but the apartment is smaller now and the situation very different. I love our roommate and he and my boyfriend have been close for years, but I can’t keep ignoring how disruptive she is. She deliberately caused tension between me and my boyfriend, and while things are better now, I can’t keep pretending it’s not affecting everyone around her. Would I be wrong to say something?\n",

      "Months into the relationship, he became emotionally abusive—making cruel comparisons, calling me names, and gaslighting me. I confided in her, but she brushed it off, saying he was probably just having a bad day. Eventually, I told her I was considering breaking up with him. She seemed oddly supportive.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few weeks later, she told me she had something to say but didn’t want to say it in person. Our dance teacher joked, “I bet she’s got a boyfriend,” and my friend ran out of the studio.

      "Title: AITA for getting a wild peacock relocated?\n",
      "Body text: So for the last 8 years I have had a wild peacock that has decided my property is where he likes to spend his days, he will come every single day, mill around and look pretty and he has become a sort of tourist attraction for anyone visiting my home. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that this bird is very loud, often in the early hours of the morning, poos absolutely everywhere, all over my patio and items, eats my potted plants and leaves his malting rubbish all over the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandma, who lives with me always feeds the bird, which is why he has pretty much become imprinted onto us, and she to no end won't stop complaining about all the poo he does everywhere (wonder why he does that). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been considering having the bird relocated by wildlife experts for a number of months now but the final straw occured when I got home from an exhausting and long week at work and I was asked by my grandmother to clean the poo off of the patio as my little cousins were going to be coming. I flat out told her that I was not going to be spending my precious relaxation time cleaning up poo from an essentially wild animal which is being encouraged to do said poo's by being fed daily, she got angry and back and forth occured until I essentially caved and spent an entire hour cleaning the crap off the patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst I caved on this occasion it also marked the end for this bird at my home, I called my local council and they organised someone to come and catch and relocate the bird to a more suitable area. Now when the bird stopped showing up everyone started to ask questions until I told them what I had done, and I got pushback from every direction, \"How will he survive when he has become so reliant on humans?\", \"Oh the kids really loved seeing the bird\" etc were being thrown at me and I basically had the same response to all the questions, \"Well, why didn't you offer to take him and have him at your place then?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So AITA for destroying the amusement of my little cousins and the companionship of a bird with a huge fashion statement?\n",

      "Body text: My friend and I planned to get dressed cute and go out and about today. Nothing special, nothing crazy just something to get out of the house. so while we were on the phone making these plans, i mentioned wanting to stop at a fast food resturant. \n",
      "so when we were on the way to said food resturant, my friend (25f) asked if i wanted to go to the fast food joint, i said yes. she even mentioned getting snow cones afterwards. \n",
      "boom, so we drive the 20 minutes it takes to get the said food resturant from my house  and as we are pulling into the drive thru, my friend asks if we can buy her SIL some food as well. \n",
      "i was confused here bc my friends house is 15 min from my house in the opposite direction so 30 min from our current location, as in we would drive past my house to get to her house to drop this food off. anyway, we get to the window, we order 4 adult meals. \n",
      "this is where i get pissed, bc i clearly stated to my friend that i wanted to go out for a few hours and get some sun. but instead she bought her family food and then was confused when i drove us home so she could take the food to her SIL. she asked if i wanted to still eat and hang out and i told her this was totally away from the plan we had both set together and that she could just leave now. because if we were going to hang out for a few hours, why would you agree to buy other people, who are 30 min away? \n",
      "\n",
      "im trying to understand why she would say yes to buying people food, when she isnt the one driving to or from the resturant so the food would be sitting in my car the whole time (its 97° today imagine the smell), they live 30 min away and we agreed to go out and have a bestie outing. am i being an asshole here? \n",

      "Body text: im 20 f who has always been an above-average, but not extreme, overachiever. Ever since I was a child, I was more drawn to co-curricular activities and practical learning, unlike my cousins who excelled academically. The comparisons started early  first in games, then in studies  and eventually turned into body shaming and constant criticism from my mother. She would mock how I looked, the way I combed my hair, how I sat or spoke. Things got worse during my early teens. I gained weight, my body and mind were changing, and emotionally I felt lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never had a loving relationship with my parents. My mother and I always maintained a formal, distant dynamic. My father never showed any interest in my hobbies or how I was doing emotionally. Every time I expressed a desire to explore music or other interests, he would shut me down, calling them \"low\" activities that good students should avoid. So, I buried that part of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I got older, I started to notice how differently my parents treated my cousins — let’s call them A (male) and B (female). B was often at our house, singing, dressing up using my mom’s things — things I was never allowed to do. They adored her for it. Once, I wore lipstick and was instantly criticized and labeled “that girl.” But for B, they bought a whole karaoke set so she could “follow her heart.” I was always included but never celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in the same school as my cousins and stayed active in debate and cultural clubs. I consistently performed well  not top-tier like them, but I was still doing great. Still, I never received any recognition. Eventually, I stopped sharing my achievements with my parents because they'd call me a loser or say I wasn’t good enough. It stopped affecting me on the surface, but deep down, I was hurting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got the chance to leave home, I did. I got into law school with good scores and was doing well for a while  until I wasn’t. I started losing myself without knowing why.

      "\n",
      "When I confronted my parents about it, they dismissed it as being “impractical.” I finally snapped — and now they’re calling me selfish and ungrateful. But the truth is, I’ve never felt seen or supported by them. I’ve always been the kid watching from the corner while others were celebrated. That pain has taken a toll on my mental health. I can’t sleep, I struggle with daily tasks, and I feel like I’m on the verge of running away  from everything.\n",

      "Title: WIBTA if I tell my (18F) friend (18F) that her mom is not happy and her present is the reason why?\n",
      "Body text: For things to make sense, I need to give you some backstory: I (18F) have a close friend—let’s call her Alice (also 18F). Our houses are side by side, and we’ve known each other for over 5 years. We’re both in our last year of high school and currently getting ready for the university entrance exams. We often have study dates at each other’s houses. Alice is super kind-hearted, but she can be kind of oblivious to the situations around her—just a very naive person overall. Alice’s family is going through a rough time right now. A couple of months ago, her dad suddenly left them for another woman. He moved out and started divorce proceedings, leaving Alice, her 14-year-old sister, and their stay-at-home mom in a really tough spot—both emotionally and financially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mom was a SAHM (stay-at-home mom) since the beginning of her marriage and didn’t have much work experience even before that. She’s also a high school dropout. After her husband left, she had to find a job, and the only thing she managed to get was a minimum wage cleaning job. She works 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, just to make ends meet. Her dad only pays the rent and utilities because it’s court-mandated. Other than that, he doesn’t contribute a cent—no alimony or child support, since the divorce isn’t finalized yet. I’m saying all of this so you understand how badly they’re struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yesterday afternoon, she invited me over to study at her house. When I got there, I saw a big box wrapped in gift paper. I asked her what it was, and she told me she bought her mom a big portable Bluetooth speaker (like the ones used for parties) as a gift to cheer her up.\n",
      "I asked how much it cost, and she said 10,000 (in our local currency, but that’s half of a monthly minimum wage salary). I was honestly shocked and asked where she got the money. She told me she’d been saving up for university since last year, but decided to spend it on the speaker to make her mom happy because her mom loves music. At that point, I didn’t want to upset her, so I changed the subject and we started studying. \n",
      "\n",
      "We studied for a few hours until her mom came home from work—completely exhausted. Alice called her mom over and gave her the gift. When her mom opened it, she looked shocked. She tried to act happy and asked Alice how much it cost. Alice told her, all smiling. Her mom looked horrified and sad, but she didn’t say anything. She just hugged Alice and went to her room. After that, I found an excuse to leave. \n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, Alice called and said her mom is really sad and anxious, and she doesn’t know why. She thinks maybe it’s because of the divorce still going on. Now I’m wondering—would I be the asshole if I gently told her that her mom isn’t happy and the gift is probably the reason why, and that maybe she should consider returning it?\n",

      "Body text: Pretty much exactly what the title says. We were on FaceTime and she casually mentioned that she’s gonna buy my cousin alcohol. I know it’s a common thing for high school kids to drink alcohol excessively but it is a universally bad habit. He’s gotten alcohol before and again I know that that’s normal behaviour. But enabling my 15 year old cousin? I feel like that’s a little weird in my opinion. When I told her that that’s not okay, she said that they’re not “gonna keep me in the loop” anymore. What does that even mean? Is she doing other stuff and not telling me? This whole situation is extremely ridiculous and uncomfortable in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked her about it again and wow it was a real eye opener. First, I FaceTimed her again and asked her if she’s still gonna buy him alcohol. She said “probably not anymore” because I was mad about it. Then I explained to her that you’re enabling a fifteen year old by buying him alcohol, giving alcohol to a minor is extremely illegal and that if anything bad happens she’s going to be held responsible. I also added that the whole “loop” comment was extremely weird. She responded by saying “the loop” meant people who they can tell about him drinking without snitching. I asked her why she felt that having a potential private communication with my fifteen year old cousin was appropriate. She took that to mean that she can’t talk to him anymore. She didn’t understand how anything of what I said was bad. This was extremely concerning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, she said she wouldn’t buy him alcohol and that it seemed normal because that’s how she grew up. The example she gave was that her parents and family friends would buy her alcohol when she was younger. I live in Ontario and the law says that minors could drink alcohol at a residence so long as their guardians are present. So I suppose for her it was kind of normal, but she didn’t think to ask if there was any adult supervision (there won’t be). \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think she will buy him alcohol, I’ll know by tomorrow I guess. Also, at the end of our conversation she said she understood, but I could easily tell she doesn’t. It’s extremely concerning. I told her it’s really weird and that I need time to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "Well she did it anyway. She had her snap maps on and she went to the liquor store right beside her work. When I sent her an ss about it. And she lied again and said she’s at work. I knew that was complete bs because it showed her at 2 different places within 5 minutes, additional to the map literally saying she’s at the liquor store. Then she doubled down and asked if I would rather him get it from some sketchy guy. It’s not about that anymore, it’s the fact that she lied to me, went behind my back, and lied to me again, because apparently it’s worth lying to your boyfriend of 2.5 years so you can supply his 15 yo cousin with alcohol. I’m gonna take a while to see if I can trust her again.\n",

We are engaged but we are already saying that we are married since we decided that we don’t want to marry legally for our personal reasons. We live together, I still work. Also it is expected that women in my country to have perfect nails, hair, etc. I pay for all of that from my own pocket since I work (ps some men pay for that as well even if girls work). \n",
      "\n",
      "So around two years ago we agreed that he sends me around $350 each month on home expenses, such as food, cleanings, dry cleaning (he likes to send his stuff to expensive one while I use a lot cheaper service), his skincare etc. yes, I do sometimes spend this money on like dinners or coffee etc when I don’t want to spend my own money just as a little treat, but he never asks for transactions and said that I can do with those money what ever I want after I buy everything that is needed for a house or for him (as you can imagine after that I can spend the rest only on a cup of coffee🤣). With that all of vacations, big purchases are on him. I spend my money only on me+ obviously can buy something for him, big or small, depends on my fin situation at the moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now! He works very hard. And we went on “vacation” with my parents. My parents are complicated and we both know it. this vacation was more of a business trip, where my bf was needed, to show him how everything works etc since he is a part of a fam now/another man in a family. He didn’t have much time to relax. And so after we came back he started talking about going to another vacation. I said that we don’t have money for that for now, since he is leaving work, and opening his own thing, also when he will start working after the opening, who know when he will get money, and how much money. So I said we should wait with vacations. He agreed and I thought that was it. But after 2 weeks he told me he booked a trip. I was not happy with it but again he works so hard so I let it slide. At the end of the day he deserves to relax before going into his own business. It will be hard at the beginning. So okey… but today I realized that nobody sent me my monthly $350. I was reluctant at first but then I finally asked about them. He said that since he paid for vacation, he thought he doesn’t need to send them… (girl math- if I didn’t get $350, then all the house expenses are going out of my own pocket, then i spend $350 of my own money, that means I paid for another vacation $350 and I didn’t even wanna go!!) you can imagine his anger with me that I asked. I started feeling uneasy… am I materialistic? But those money go towards house expenses, I didn’t ask for vacation, but he bought it anyway without even telling me about it and about the fact that I won’t have those $350 this month…\n",

      "Body text: So about 3 months ago, my (28M) friend (25M) called me up saying he broke up with his girlfriend and needed a place to stay for a couple months. He's a great guy, just always been down on his luck, so I said that would be fine. I live alone in my own house and had a guest bedroom he could stay in. I told him the first month he stays is totally free, and any month after just to give me $500.\n",

      "When he moved in I only set 2 rules: he needs to ask me before he invites anyone over, and no women over for sex. We had a pretty good time until about a month in when he invited a mutual friend over without asking me. Since it was a mutual friend, I let it slide, but reminded him I'd like a heads-up before you invite people over. A few weeks later, he told me he planned on taking a weekend trip, so I let him know I decided to invite a girl from work over that weekend (which included having sex). The day she was supposed to come over, he was still chilling in his room and I asked about his plans. He told me his weekend plans got canceled and that he was going to have to cockblock me. I asked him if he could please find somewhere else to go for the night, and after a bit of arguing he agreed to leave. Kind of mean of me, but later we both agreed I was in the right, it's my house and he knew about my date night almost a week in advance.\n",

      "So fast forward another month and my buddy comes home late from work, and tells me all about how he met this girl at the bar. I told him thats awesome and I'm really happy for him, until he tells me I need to be out of the house Tuesday night because she's coming over. I told him no, I'm not comfortable with that. This isn't a girl that either of us know, my original ground rules were no women over for sex, and I own the bed that they would be having sex on. He told me its not fair that I can have girls over and that he can't, and referenced the night I asked him to leave so that I could get with my coworker. I reiterated that this was my house and I'm not comfortable with it, and asked if he could go over to her place. He then said she has roommates and it wouldn't work, and I told him that *he* has a roommate and its not going to work. He then said whatever and went to his room, we haven't talked since.\n",

      "\n",
      "EDIT 1: The comment section is definitely going much differently than I expected lol, so maybe I should just add a little more context. Him moving in was completely unexpected, I wasn't prepared at all for an additional living partner, but I'm not the kind of person to let my friend live on the street. I payed for his moving truck and spent the night helping him move what little he had into my home. I see some people calling him my tenant, and maybe legally he is, but thats not the relationship we have or intended to have, we're just friends. This whole thing is supposed to be short term, when he first moved in, we agreed he'd find a new place by August. I never saw him as a roommate, but moreso as a guest in my home until he found a new place. The $500/month was his idea, and is probably 1/3 the price he'd pay for any apartments in our area. I also don't think people realize how much more utilities go up per person, since he's moved in my bill has gone up by $200/month easily (including an additional $50 in internet because he begged me to upgrade my current plan so that he could stream on twitch). Everything in the room he's staying in belongs to me, bed and sheets included. I gave him 2 rules which he agreed to and he broke one and tried to break the other. While I did invite a girl over, this was something he knew about a week in advance, I only invited her over because I knew he was going to be out of the house, and the night she did come over, I told her she had to be out by 10 because I wasnt going to make him sleep somewhere else. He did come back that night and did sleep in his room.\n",

      "To those of you calling me a bad friend, go fuck yourself. I've given up so much of my life to make things better for him, stayed up for hours with him while he cried about his breakup and opened a space in my home for him to stay during his time of need. If me not letting him have sex in my bed makes me a bad friend, then I'm totally okay with that lol.\n",

      "Body text: She has not passed yet, but she may be on her death bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I was adopted. Removed from biological parents at 7, adopted at 9. My adoptive parents were both unbelievably abusive, but I was under her care the longest. I still shock therapists and found family to this day with what she put me and my siblings through. She kicked me out when I was 15, but told my three siblings I chose to leave them with her. Took three years to clear that up. Very much a story for another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm second guessing myself on attending what seems to be her imminent funeral because I know I'm probably supposed to. I love my siblings and would want to support them through this difficult time, but I also don't believe I would be able to hide the fact that I've been awaiting this day for many years. I never wished death upon her, but boy have I waited for her to get what she deserves. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've barely spoken to my adoptive mother in twelve years. One time she queried why her children don't consider her a mother, so I said I could inform her if she wished to discuss it. She said she would talk to me the next week, and didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "My adoptive father and his family regularly act like she only did what a loving, Godly mother would do. But still state she apologized for what she did to us when we were children. She never has. She has only ever said \"Maybe I could have done some things differently, but I was only following God's plan.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I could gray-rock my way through an entire funeral with everyone and their mother, literally, telling me how \"wonderful, lovely, and Godly\" my mother was when I know differently and no one ever believed me. My siblings still see her in a completely different light even though they still struggle with what this \"Godly\" woman put us through. \n",

      "\n",
      "Now during the party, my sister and I sat with our other uncle the entire time but C would come around and \"make jokes\" and it was at me and my sister's expense. This is the way he normally is I'm just not used to being at the receiving end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was showing off his newly renovated office and he had a dry-erase board with family photos on it but none of me. He had said that he would put my photo up if I let him call by a name that isn't my name. (My name is gender neutral and he never calls me by it, he adds a -ie to it. I correct him every time). When he said that, I didn't laugh, I actually glared at him. He started laughing and saying \"what was that look for\" and \"you're going to make a good girlfriend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When my sister and I made it back to the hotel I called my mom to tell her all that had happened that day. I told my mom about what he said in the office and she was grossed out. After that I went to take a shower but my sister kept on talking to my mom. When I got out she’d hung up because there was an issue with my grandparents hotel room and she was going to ask C for help because he paid for the hotel rooms.\n",

      "Like ten minutes later C calls my sister and asks to be put on speaker phone. He then proceeds to cuss us out for being \"snitches,\" \"little bitches,\" and \"pussies\" because we couldn't handle his teasing. He said more things along the line of us being sheltered and that our mom failed in raising us because we couldn't handle his teasing. He went on and on for like three minutes but it honestly felt like ten. During this my mom had tried to call twice but both me and my sister were frozen just because I could never imagine him doing this. He ended the call by saying that he hopes my sister enjoys college because she need a to be exposed to the real world and grow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We told our mom what happened and she called our grandma who kind of just asked what we did and we know that he's like that so why were we complaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things have been tense ever since. I'm back home now but my grandparents haven't spoken to me, my sister or my mom since then and we normally talk like everyday. I think my grandma is mad at me because she said that when she spoke to C afterwards that he said that my sister was having a good time but I was the one who was being mean and instigating stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't feel bad at first but I'm starting to. Did I do something wrong? I struggle with getting social cues so I don't know if I ever went too far with something. I doubt I will ever speak to my uncle again but I feel like I've torn my family apart. My mom would talk to C about anything and everything and they would help each other out and I just feel like I ruined everything. AITA?\n",

      "She doesn't like the same music as me, but she's never had an issue with going to my concerts with me in the past and seemed to really enjoy herself.

I'm 41 and she's 37, but I feel like she's overreacting so badly. After all, I agreed not to go just to make her happy.

Now, all the sudden, it makes me a terrible person because I would even want to go to a concert. Anyway, in the end she left my house last night and went back to her place. She sent me a long text with all kinds of falsehoods and exaggerations, saying I don't love or want my kid and I want to go to a drug event.

      "I have been planning my wedding for a year and a half. I'm autistic, as well as my fiancé. So, a slow planning process we call \"low stress wedding planning\" has been my biggest priority. We have been very careful about who our vendors are, who's on the guest list, and all the details. I moved to a different state after college because I needed a fresh start away from the space I was never safe to unmask. I moved here and have been living my best life, entirely unmasked, and learning how to accept myself with my disabilities. I have verbal shutdowns and full body shutdowns occasionally, and I need a support person with me at all times. This is important for the guest list.. This is also going to be Sunday Brunch - Victorian High Tea - Garden Party wedding. It's a dry wedding as well.   \n",
      "  \n",
      "Present time:  \n",
      "It's less than a year away now, and we just sent out the save the dates. My parents had been asking for the guest list, which we shared after Save the Dates went out (and made sure everyone knew there would be no edits). My dad messaged me to say he had one request; that his boss was added to the guest list. He added, \"Since that is who was paying for the wedding.\" Which was news to me.  \n",

I don't want any extra reasons to end up in some sort of shutdown and have the entire thing canceled because I can't move my body or speak. He threw it back to say, \"I know this is your wedding, but it is MY daughters wedding.\" I sent him a voice message explaining how it could affect me to invite a stranger and that this will be the first time anyone from my family will see me without any masking. I tried to explain that I wouldn't have accepted the money had they told me where it was coming from and that it came with a contingency.   \n",

      "Body text: I (27F) have been friends with Kay (30M) for 6 years. We met while traveling and have been mostly long distance friends, but we've made time to visit each other and stayed really close over text/phone calls. I recently invited him as my plus-one to my friend's destination wedding in Spain, and I booked us a nice hotel room since he was making the effort of traveling out for this. It was out of his budget, so I lied to him about how much it cost and paid for most of it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole wedding party was staying there for a week. The first night, as we were out bar hopping, Kay hit a point where he'd had way too much to drink -- I'd seen him in this state before, and recognized the difference when he'd crossed over into blackout drunk -- and he was a pain in the ass to deal with. He loses his filter and starts saying things that can be really hurtful, AND he's a lot stronger/heavier than me, making it impossible (and sometimes dangerous) to try to wrangle him when he's being a drunk idiot. (More dangerous for him than for me, like the time I tried to carry his drunk ass out of a cab and he face-planted on the curb, but still dangerous).\n",
      "\n",
      "After that first night, I was really annoyed with Kay, but he genuinely didn't remember how he'd behaved the night before. When I told him about it he was really apologetic, and promised he would be more careful that night -- but by noon he was already drinking again, and that night turned out the same as before. By the time we got to the day of the wedding, I warned him that I was exhausted and fed-up and that if he got too drunk at the wedding, I wasn't letting him stay in my hotel room. He proceeded to get too drunk, was too out of it to listen to me when I told him I didn't want him staying in my hotel, and the groomsmen had to drag him back to their Airbnb with them, where he was apparently shouting insults about me until he passed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the morning, he remembered none of this. He was once again really apologetic, and I felt conflicted, but ultimately I told him I couldn't trust his apology anymore. I sent his money back to him and asked him to get his own hotel room for the last couple nights of the trip. Some people from the wedding party say I went too far and I was an asshole for this -- I'm the one who invited him as a plus-one, it's normal to get drunk at a wedding/on vacation, and I honestly feel like an asshole myself since I know we were in an expensive place and getting his own hotel room in that area might have been out of his budget. But I feel like 30 is too old to not know your own limits with alcohol, especially when you're a really strong guy and not easy for other people to manage. So am I the asshole for kicking my friend out?\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Clarification 1: Yes, I'd seen Kay act like this once before, but that was 5 years ago when I was still in college and he was 25. I guess I was used to seeing drunk idiots in college and I wrote that off at the time as us both being young. Since then we've mostly stayed in touch over the phone, and it sounded like he'd been maturing since then -- he talked about going out less often and not wanting to drink as much when he did. That's why I invited him along to this wedding, but yes it was still my judgment and I'm responsible for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarification 2: The groomsmen who took him in volunteered to do that when they saw how he was behaving with me (they're good friends of mine). I did feel really bad about this, don't get me wrong -- but I'm grateful that they stepped up as friends and helped me out that one night. Kay ended up staying in an airport hotel for the remaining couple nights of the trip.\n",

I tried to be supportive, but it got to the point where I started having headaches and feeling totally drained every day.\n",

      "At one point, L came to me asking if something was wrong, and I told him the truth because I couldn’t keep being the emotional buffer. This obviously made things worse between them.

I’ve explained this to her and shared that I avoid confrontation because of things from my past. She said she understands, but still expects more from me, and I now feel super guilty.\n",

S has no idea I’m moving out. I haven’t told her yet because I know she’ll take it very personally and spiral. She already thinks I’m distancing myself emotionally, and this would feel like the final blow.\n",

He claimed to have gone over the whole thing, cleaned it, detailed it, made sure that no lights were coming up on the dash/scanner and claims he has NEVER had an issue with it. We at the car home and the following day, the battery is dead, so we question them about the battery and they immediately get defensive. Not a huge deal, just wondering if there’s ever been an issue with it before because now it won’t start without jumping it.\n",

Then about a week later, the check engine light comes on (which was scanned and came up as a major evap leak) and when we start the car to move it, it starts leaking coolant (mind you, we haven’t been driving the car because we haven’t had a chance to register it yet, it’s just been sitting in our garage and sometimes we need to move it). When we mentioned this to James to see if he had any problems he forgot to mention, he got angry and said he felt like we were accusing him of being a scam artist, it started a huge fight between all of us and basically ended the friendship. Now we have this POS car that we were told was in “great shape” and lost a friend. Should we not even have brought it up to him and took the loss? AITA for finding the situation a little sketchy?\n",

I came across a post that two girls posted and they seemed like we’d get along really well, which we do! Their third roommate was moving out and I decided I was going to move in. I do have a lot of debt but I was just planning on trying to make it work. My parents offered for me to stay with them for another year so I wouldn’t be struggling and could pay down a lot of my debt/save money. I was torn on what to do. I hadn’t signed a lease yet and I ended up ultimately deciding to stay with my parents for another year so I wouldn’t be struggling. I let them know I wasn’t going to be moving in a couple days ago, and rent is due on the first. According to them they will have to cover the third portion of June if they don’t find someone before then. They asked me (very passive aggressively) if I would pay my portion of the first months rent and I don’t know what to do. I feel like that’s unfair and I really don’t want to pay over $1000 for nothing in return. Again, I never signed a lease. The landlord did not ask me to pay, the other tenants did.

      "My grandparents' have a neighbour, Ned, who used to be a professional photographer before retiring. He's taken photos of me and my family throughout the years. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he first took photos of me, I was slim and sharp-looking. I was a student with no money. In the 7 years since then, I got a job that is sedentary with little activity but coupled with getting paid well, I ate more, exercised less and gained weight. I wasn't obese but I realised that I needed new clothes and to fix this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to 2025. Over the last 6 months, I have been eating healthier, exercising a lot more and whilst change has been gradual, I have noticed my clothes getting bigger on me and that I feel much more able, energetic and overall, happier. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, one evening a month ago, I was at my grandparents' place and guess who barged in completely uninvited and with a camera in hand? Yup, Ned. We hadn't seen each other in four years at that point and he told, \"oh! You're fatter! It doesn't look nice! Hehe\". I got offended since I knew that I was fatter but that I was actively changing that. After some time, I told him, \"and you've gotten older. So what? People change!\" He then said to me, \"ah, I see that you're bothered by what I said so now you'll remember it\" as if to say, \"haha, thanks to me, you'll finally do something about your weight, fatty\". \n",
      "\n",
      "He then acted as if it were nothing and whipped out his camera to take photos of us. I politely refused and walked away stating, \"well, why would you want me in your photos? Clearly I'm too fat\". He and some of my family members called me repeatedly to pose for his photos but I was hurt. Ned said, \"come on, It'll look lovely!\" I said no. Ned then said, \"ah, now I'm really offended. Look at him, he's hurting me! The photos will be incomplete without him\" to which I replied, \"well, Ned, now you know how I feel!\" Ned replied, \"come on, you know I didn't mean it. You're like my son!\" I wanted to ask him why he hadn't sent me money on my birthday in that case but I didn't, wishing not to escalate things further. My dad then told me, \"come on, have good humour!\" I ended up posing for the photos through my pain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of my family was on my side, understanding how I felt and agreeing that it wasn't nice for Ned to say those things. My grandpa even told me that normally, Ned has no problem offending people with his jokes but that when HE gets offended, he loses it. Just about everyone agreed that Ned was in the wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, my dad asked me why I walked away and told him that it was an adult reaction considering that the alternative would've been to blow up in his face. He then told me that in life, people will say nasty things and that I need to be the bigger person and not to walk away and be the AH in this situation. \n",

      "It's worth noting that I live in a third world country, and being surrounded by family is very natural here, which will be important later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five years ago, our father (60) passed away after battling a long illness that left everyone in a mentally and financially desperate state. My mother dedicated years to keeping him comfortable, and his death was a shock to all of us as we thought it was just another scare that he would overcome.\n",
      "On the day of the funeral, we sat as a family and agreed that all expenses related to our mother would be shared equally. The pension in our country is very low (less than the equivalent of 100 USD per month). At first, this agreement worked, but over time everything fell apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "HG went through a painful divorce a year later, lost the house and car, had to change jobs, and start over from scratch. His ex-wife left the country, and he was left to pick up the pieces. As a family, we all helped in various ways, from lending money to giving him furniture from our parents' house for his new rental home.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time, our mother decided to leave the family house and move to a more suitable space for her new reality. The family house is huge, with two floors and a separate apartment on the ground floor. She decided to pass the house on to us.\n",
      "The middle brother, HH, asked for permission to move in with his family. He convinced our mother it was the best thing to do. He could be closer to her and was tired of living in his small apartment.\n",
      "They made the decision, and I didn’t oppose it. I was genuinely concerned about our mother living alone in a house where nine people had once lived comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was handed over to him, and he took out a large loan to renovate it. The problem began when his wife, KH (44), started bullying our mother during the renovations.\n",
      "And don’t get me wrong — we had always been a close family, and she always got along with everyone. But at that moment, she revealed a horrible side. She personally and blatantly attacked many aspects of our mother’s life — and, in some ways, mine too.\n",
      "This woman entered the house as if she owned it and yelled at a lady who was like a mother to her just because she didn’t agree with something in the renovation. (At first, the apartment wasn’t going to be included in the renovation, but over time my mother gave in because KH thought the aesthetics of the house had to flow and the apartment would clash.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the outbursts, because she felt she was being persecuted. She isolated herself — and especially our brother. He stopped talking to the family. In one year, we became strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, I did everything I could to invite them to my son’s birthday party at my house (which I saw as neutral ground). She, my brother, and their youngest son showed up, but she refused to come inside. She said the energy in my house was terrible and that there was something negative and a “dark presence” there. Needless to say, she scared my kids, and I asked her to wait in the car — which she did.\n",
      "We were never cordial again.\n",
      "After that episode, it took three years for my brother to return to my house. They stopped the renovation work and she refused to live there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the rumors started.\n",
      "Last year, she was seen in compromising situations with other men. Our oldest brother tried to talk to HH to make sure he didn’t hear it from someone else. Hell broke loose.\n",
      "He didn’t want to know and accused anyone who brought up the subject of trying to ruin his life. The brothers haven’t spoken since. The hurt remained.\n",
      "My mother suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this, she packed up and left the country (and mind you, she didn’t deny anything — quite the opposite). You would expect HH to finally accept that the family was there for him. But no. He became even more resentful and distanced himself further. We went from little contact to none — not even about issues related to our mother.\n",
      "Last month, he suddenly became interested in the house again. He said he plans to move in soon.\n",
      "I heard from his friends that she wants to return to the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just last month, we had to come together to pay for an expensive surgery for our mother — HH didn’t contribute and even got offended when we asked. He still sends money to his ex-wife.\n",

      "Body text: My brother (33 M) lives across the country near my sister-in-law’s family with my niece (6 F) and nephew (1 M). SIL’s family is upper middle class, mine is closer to the poverty line, my mom and I would be homeless if it wasn’t for grandma (mom’s mom) taking us in (I promise this has relevance).\n",
      "Ever since my brother moved to be with SIL, he has only come to visit us twice: once to meet her, second time to show off my then 6 month old niece. Our grandma really wants to meet my niece, now that she has any idea what’s going on, and nephew, but she’s afraid of flying due to her not being able to get around much due to her age. We thought that the best decision would be for them to come visit us.\n",

      "Now, every time we try to talk my brother into coming to visit us for holidays or birthdays, or even just because we can’t afford to fly out and see them but once every couple years (which we have done multiple times), he comes up with some excuse as to why they can’t come here. Either he’s working on it, then doesn’t follow up about it, or bills were piling up and he had to spend the money on that. I’d accept that money is tight and flying with two kids under the age of 10 is hard, if it weren’t for two things: \n",
      "1- Mom has offered to pay for their tickets to come visit, despite him making more money per year than mom and I combined, and 2- They’ve flown to Florida and Mexico for vacation more times than I’ve even been near my local airport. He also asks for gas or lunch money from my mom and sends baby pics as a reward (reward in my opinion, no idea what else to call it).\n",

Mom just says she’s gonna kill him, but obviously she’s just disappointed and not trying to let it show. I’m also very disappointed, because I love my brother and his family, and I was looking forward to showing them some cool things that we’ve got here (also spoiling the shit out of my niece and nephew). I wish he would just come out and say what he means instead of stringing us along; that he doesn’t want to come back here. \n",

      "Thanks y'all for your inputs, I really appreciate it. Some of your comments have had me figure out that I probably wasn't too clear on my intention with confronting him, if \"confront\" is even the right word. I'm autistic and often have problems clarifying what I mean (trying to work on it, but it doesn't always work), or implicitly knowing what other people mean. I wanted to \"confront\" him so he can clarify why he doesn't want to come to us. Whether we're just boring, or if there's something more to it, having a reason would make things easier on us so we don't prepare for something that isn't coming, in my opinion. Also, we (or I, at least) know that we're not entitled to his family or his finances. If I came off as expecting to know that information, I'm sorry. I sincerely don't know how to fix that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking y'all's advice, I'm not going to talk to him, but I am going to ask my mom and grandma to just not expect them to ever come and be comfy with that idea (maybe in softer terms). I'm also going to keep insisting to my mom that she doesn't send him money since a family relationship shouldn't be transactional.\n",

My friends said they were so embarrassed and I was being rude for asking for my pen back.  I honestly don’t know why he needed my pen for 15 minutes as the custom form was not that complicated.

      "\n",
      "Context: Patrick and I have been friends for 3 years. He was the first guy friend who never made a pass at me, which meant a lot given my bad experiences with male friends. Both our partners are back in the states - I'm with Trevor (25m) for over a year, Patrick's been long-distance with Maria (19f) for 8-9 months. I'm bi, they're all straight.\n",

I handed the phone back quickly because I hate when people do that, but immediately Patrick accused me of flirting with his girlfriend.\n",

      "The other two people on our trip came back, saw Patrick without me, and kept asking where I was. He kept saying I was \"right behind him\" - I wasn't. Trevor had to call one of my friends to get the others' numbers so they could find me.\n",

      "Body text: Today my partner and I went hiking with our friend to a state park in Indiana called “Turkey Run State. We’ve never had any issues with people here until we dined in at the restaurant at the park. I want to clarify that we are all 20. We were all raised in indiana although I was raised with a different culture so I am not familiar with the norm. I am not a social person but i do my best to be kind. We go to restaurants somewhat often and the waiters we have are usually kind and friendly so we leave tips around 15%-20% because their service was exceptional. However, once we were sat down the waiter seemed okay. Once we decided what we wanted to eat, we waited the normal amount of time it takes for the waiter to return. As soon as she returned, she asked for orders and I began with a steak burger and asked if the house chips were french fries or chips like lays. before i could finish she interrupted with “nope, french fries are french fries and house chips are house chips.” i was trying to explain that I have know restaurants sometimes refer to french fries as chips so wanted to be sure but she did not give me the chance to finish. After that she began to take the rest of our orders in a manner as if she did not want to be serving us. then again we are all not social but try to be kind. after that, my friend says thank you after they refilled their water and they respond with you’re welcome nothing odd but once i said thank you, no response. I tried thanking them again after they returned and again no response. Meanwhile an elderly couple and family walk in, order and get their order before us. she walks by our table saying “your food will be out soon guys the chicken takes less time then what you ordered” my partner and friend both ordered chicken as well. After waiting 30 minutes our food arrives, we thank them and no response other than “enjoy your food”. We did not enjoy the food. it had tasted as if it had been sitting for a while, my partner and friend can confirm it was because they both worked at a local business with a grill. the bread had become soggy from sitting as well as the meat had become dry. we finish our food and decided not to tip because of what we believed was poor service and the waiter looks at us and says in a loud voice while pointing at the receipt “you guys don’t want to tip?” and we say “no thanks”. as we are preparing to leave she slams my card down on the table even though i reached for it. she walked away and in a disapproving tone says “have good day thanks for eating here”. i’m not sure if we did anything wrong since it was not busy or late. we all work in food service so we have a good understanding of how stressful things get but we’re sure that we were kind throughout the time there so we don’t understand why we were treated so poorly.

She was leashed (as were numerous other dogs) because she gets nervous when the water chases her, but she loves to chase it back as it recedes. As we were approaching the water, this woman's small dog (slightly larger than a chihuahua) comes running up to my dog, barking at her, and even bit her legs a few times causing my dog to screech and jump behind me. I called out \"Who's dog is this?\" as I was desperately trying to shield my dog and rotate to keep the little ankle biter in my view and away from my pup. The woman called out that it was hers, and I said \"Could you get your dog?\" To that she responds, while sitting on her towel not doing a thing, that it's a dog beach and that if my dog can't handle it, to go elsewhere. \n",

But this woman proceeded to gather a crowd once we rushed away to tell a completely different story, painting my dog as vicious, and encouraged about 10 people to scream profanities and insults as we left.\n",

Since my 18 month old daughter was born she’s been to our house 4 times never stayed longer than an hour. I always loved snakes and had Ball pythons years ago so I got another one in February so about 3 months ago my MIL called my husband when she found out two weeks ago and completely flipped out saying “how could you allow that ,now I’ll never be able to visit my granddaughter.. how am I suppose to build a relationship with her if I can’t come to your house” and demanding we get rid of it because she has an extreme fear of snakes and we “don’t care about her feelings” we’re “inviting evil into our home” 😐. Meanwhile she barley ever came over before this and we’ve gone to her house a thousand times but she likes to sleep until noon and there’s a lot of people who live there so we don’t always stay to long it’s very crowded and if you have an 18 month old you know they get into everything and can’t stay in one area. The snake is locked in a vivarium unable to get out and she’s very small still , hides all day long as they are nocturnal and the vivarium is up high so she wouldn’t be able to see inside unless she was standing on her tippy toe. I told my MIL im not getting rid of the snake for her and if seeing her at our home was so important to her then she should have came more often she had no clue I even had it for 3 months because she hasn’t been here since Christmas! She told me I was inconsiderate and I told her she was using her “fear” probably as a reason to get out of coming here altogether. My husband  actually agrees with me as she has never expressed a fear of snakes before and his brother owned about 30 of them at one point years and years ago and she never complained then and was at his house plenty of times. Even though my husband agrees with me he wants me to apologize because I shouldn’t have actually said it to her even if it’s true .. AITA? Maybe I am but he wants us to come to a compromise and she made it very clear there wasn’t one unless I got rid of it.

While discussing wedding planning, my mother brought up my relationship to my sister and was talking about me and my boyfriend's future in front of my sister and her fiancé -- plus family. My sister texted me about this, and I agreed it was in poor taste and that I'm so sorry it had even happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where it got messy: she then asks if my boyfriend and I were getting engaged before she gets married (tentative date: 1.5 yrs from now). I shrugged: it was likely, but not certain. She was hurt, telling me that it's becoming about \"'the \\[our last name\\] girls getting married,' not her and her fiancé. I agreed that it was messed up, but it doesn't change that I only need to consider us when it comes to our plans for our lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that I'm \"planning to get engaged in the months before her wedding\" to steal her spotlight, that it's always been this way, claiming that we got the idea to be engaged because they were (not true at all), asking me if I wanted to get celibacy over with, if I'm going to wear white to her wedding. She even said she doesn't want to talk to me ever again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was baffled how I woke up one day and now my potential engagement is suddenly an issue overnight. That said, I can understand my sister's feelings, and while I don't want to, I offered to only announce our engagement after her wedding. She didn't like the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother told me that it's etiquette for a younger sibling to wait a month after their eldest sibling's wedding to announce engagement. My sister said that she asked all of her friends about this, and they all agreed that it is messed up -- hence why I'm posting here.\n",

My mother works and is gone every day working on projects in the area, when he left I took over most of the fatherly duties with my brother.\n",

Now he's about to come back, and I feel helpless, I don't want to stay in this house taking care of them while he's here, he had his chance and he lost it.

A few weeks ago my buddy Marcus got his first car, so we can all go places without having to ask someone's parents or something. Shawn has cerebral palsy and used to get picked on a lot for it, but Marcus and I have been big guys since middle school, so no one really says shit anymore. \n",

Maybe it's stupid but we didn't think about getting Shawn's wheelchair up the trails would be that hard, just thought it would be like dirt and not all rocks. But we always bring Shawn the places we go, so Marcus and I ditched the wheelchair in the car and took turns who carried the backpack and who carried Shawn. Honestly none of us thought it was a big deal, we've carried him places before and stuff. Or like last year when Marcus's cousin had a pool party and we swam around with Shawn, his mom said it was chill. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But then on the way back down, this lady was on her way up and just started yelling at us. Saying that it was horrible to drag someone up a mountain without proper restraints. Like, first off, restraints are stupid. I wouldn't want to be tied up, you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "We got back and showed his mom pics since Shawn can't really talk, but he was still doing his happy yelling the whole way home and stuff and she got all weepy but in a good way looking at pics. We took a bunch of us on the way up and down, not just at the top, and she did say we should get a backpack harness attachment situation for him when we do it again.\n",

Thats where I want to know if we're assholes. Like if we should have turned around and waited until we bought a harness or something. It was hard and really exhausting, but it didn't feel dangerous until thinking about what that lady said about someone getting hurt. But yeah, Shawn's mom was really happy and printed out some pics of it to hang around her office.\n",
      "\n",
      "So are me and Marcus assholes for going at it anyway and getting Shawn up to the lake? Or should we have turned around when his wheelchair wasn't good for the trails? I just feel like Shawn gets super bummed out if we back out of doing shit because he can't, so we figure stuff out all the time, but we've never gone hiking before so was this too far?\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, in March, she started a rumor that I was dating my mentor (23M). It was because he offered to drive me to a store that is out of walking distance to get something specific I needed for a project, and we ran into her. It was an act of kindness as he had a car, and he needed something from the same store anyways. The act of driving me to the store was fine, but the rumor caused a TON of issues and ended with me having to switch mentors and him having to prove his innocence to a research ethics board who also deemed the situation completely acceptable. The new mentor I work for is also very nice, but the scope of our work is very far out of what I originally wanted to do and I’m upset that I’m not learning what I’d like to because my roommate decided to tell everyone we were dating. I know she started the rumor because I know she has an affinity for gossip but also because she was behind us in the aisles giggling to her boyfriend and other people told me that they heard these rumors from her. \n",

      "She asked about my work with that mentor today, and I told her the truth: “I’m not working with him anymore. Someone thought it was okay to spread a rumor that we were dating so I had to get switched into a different group and he almost got put on academic probation. I’m really upset that someone would say stuff like that and try to ruin his career and force me to work in a different group; I’m sure you get it after all those rumors spread about you.” I didn’t say it in an accusatory manner, I played dumb. However, I heard her crying to her boyfriend about feeling bad about something and our other roommate (who is aware I know about who started the rumors) told me I was an asshole and petty for pretending like I didn’t know who started it all to guilt trip her instead of outright confronting her like an adult.\n",

However, we are still having a very large family wedding next summer. The small wedding we had only had 10 people not including us and the officiant. While the large wedding will have over 200 people (we both come from large families). I have a strenuous relationship with my father & his family so to make things easier and to have at least a perfect small stress free wedding I didn’t not invite them. My fiancé ultimately understood but didn’t want me to regret anything so he told me I should consider inviting them. I didn’t invite them or tell them & I don't regret a thing. We recently found out that my in-laws got drunk at a party & told everyone in my fiancés family & friends we already got married. Some say they won’t be coming to our large wedding and accused us of doing this to show off our wealth but also get gifts. We aren’t doing that btw. My fiancé is upset about the false accusations, I am too, but he is also upset because they told everyone his work information which is a very large problem. I am upset about all this too but I am also upset they might tell my family at the wedding that I already got married and upset them. While my family has done me very wrong in the past I still love them very much and don’t wish to hurt them like they have hurt me. I told my in-laws and everyone else again to not say anything but me and my fiancé don’t trust them. What should we do? Was I wrong to not invite them or tell them?\n",

      "Title: AITA: Family is now very upset because I did not invite Uncle 2 and his family to my college graduation\n",
      "Body text: Hey everyone, I graduated college soon (yay!) and planned a small celebration with family from my mom’s side — just people I feel close to. My mom has been my biggest supporter, so of course she’s invited. I also invited one of my uncles (Uncle 1), his daughter (we’re cool, I even went to her nursing graduation), and my grandparents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t invite another uncle (Uncle 2) or his daughters due to long-standing tension. Since childhood, I’ve felt resentment from them. When I got into multiple top 20 schools, their mom literally walked out of the room when my mom shared the news. Later, one cousin posted a scandalous pic during the pandemic. I didn’t say anything about it, but just viewing it triggered them to attack me online, calling me jealous, very ugly, etc. I never understood where all this hatred came from— I’ve never compared myself to them in anyway. This was around when the pandemic started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now fast forward: I transferred schools, stayed in my city, and I’m proud to be graduating. Uncle 1 agreed to come and even offered to host a BBQ. But then he asked my mom if she told Uncle 2 about my graduation. She said no — because I didn’t want him or his daughters there for my peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, today is my college graduation dinner. I invited Uncle 1 and my cousin and her bf, Uncle 2 only (not his daughters or wife) and my grandparents. Uncle 2 then said his daughters are coming. My mom was not happy, but I already told my mom if you invite Uncle 2, he's going to bring his daughters. This was not a shock for me. I then mentioned to Uncle 2, I am comfortable for his daughters to come, it is my graduation dinner. After being called all these names by them idk. I even remember calling me fat when I was younger. Uncle 1 hears of this and then calls my moms yells at her, curses, and then hangs up then accused us of creating division. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m confused of this hatred towards me and my mother— when his own daughter graduated, Uncle 2 and his family didn’t attend or congratulate her. In addition, while talking to Uncle 1, Uncle 2 daughter graduated high school and I and my mom did not know. Furthermore, other cousins haven’t invited Uncle 2 to weddings or graduations either. But now it feels like I’m the bad guy for protecting my peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, because of this I broke down crying because they all made me feel like the bette noir. This was not how I wanted my graduation dinner to be. This is also why I didnt want my mom to tell Uncle 1 about my graduation because I didn't want drama. But alas, there was alot of drama today. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like the black sheep. I worked hard and just want to celebrate with people I’m comfortable with, and now being attacked saying im the an only child, who will you call when u need help, you need to forgive, you are creating division, etc.  Why do you think this is happening?\n",

      "Body text: I am a single F living in another state from the rest of my family. My parents and my sibling/sibling's spouse/their kids all live within a half mile of each other. My parents and sibling's spouse's parents helped out with the kids for most of their childhood up until about 4 years ago, so about 10 years for multiple kids. They are the only grandchildren on both sides. I visit about every three months since it's \"easier\" for me to travel rather than for all of them. My parents visit at least once a year, but the last time my sibling's family came was in 2014 - my sibling's kids have come to visit once on their own and my sibling and sibling's spouse have come to visit a couple of times since 2014 when they had business in town.\n",

Since 2017, he's been to the ER over 20 times, and sibling has been there for every single visit to the ER and hospital admission. I have been there later or, in some cases, not at all, relying solely on my sibling and my mom, and in some cases, my dad if he's able to talk in that time for the news and updates on his situation. I have fur babies, and it takes a bit for me to gather things and get it situated to leave my home and my fur babies for an unknown period of time. In the past, I've spent up to 5 weeks there to help out, all while being away from my own home with someone else taking care of my fur babies. They, on the other hand, get to go home whenever they want. If I'm there, I'm there!\n",

      "Our most recent situation took a surprising turn. I was visiting after another ER bout, but dad was home by the time I showed up. As soon as I left, dad was back in the ER, and I've learned that sibling is super bitter about this. Sibling states that I only see the \"good\" stuff and I don't have anything going on in my life, and sibling has a whole family they have to take care of. There was even a statement made about me from my sibling and their spouse that I have an entire holiday weekend where I could have just stayed rather than coming back home \"knowingly\" leaving my dad in a weakened state.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was originally going to go back to support my mom more than anything, but my mom said she is fine, and anyway, it's been over two weeks since I've had time at my own home since I've been traveling to see other extended family. She recommended I not go back. Dad is now admitted to the hospital and is in the care of nurses and doctors, but sibling feels the need to be there a lot more hours than I would have, but I am expected to be there too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a lot of unresolved emotion around my dad, which has caused hesitation in the past for me, but I've usually sucked it up. But now I'm wondering if I am the asshole for leaving sibling to fend for this visit to the hospital by themselves. Should I suck it up again and just go back? \n",

      "\n",
      "So I (25M) was helping my girlfriend (29F) move a new living room set into her apartment. It came from her grandparents, who are sweet people… and they own a cat. The furniture set includes a fabric loveseat (10/10 comfort, would nap again) and a leather couch (pretty solid, has some claw marks but it was free). We quickly found out that my girlfriend is super allergic to cats because the fabric loveseat was giving her a reaction. Not “call an ambulance” allergic, but definitely puffy eyes, sneezing/coughing, congestion. Allergy stuff 101.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loveseat is basically soaked in cat dander. Like, we’re 90% sure that this was the cats favorite place. Gf will not use it until it gets steam cleaned next week. The leather couch also has some cat history (claw marks are visible on the pillows), but she has been using it all week, she says it's not nearly as bad as the loveseat. Ive had cats and leather before and presumed that there was probably way less fur or dandruff on the leather couch compared to the loveseat and that it was safe for her to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to the other night: my girlfriend had a rough emotional day at work and ended up crying and eventually passing out, we've all had those days. She flopped down on the leather couch with the TV on kinda loud and I left the lights on because I was cooking. Eventually, I tried to wake her off of the couch. She mumbled something about needing to walk the dog and immediately fell back asleep. Seemed like she needed the rest, so I let her be and went to bed. Tv still on and lights on.\n",

      "Leaving the lights and TV on, which gave her a massive headache, and an even bigger asshole for letting her sleep on the \"cat couch,\" (I wasn't even aware the leather couch caused an allergic reaction up until this point). I told her she knew the risks and that she looked comfortable and really could have used the rest, She told me it was rude to \"forget about her\" and that no reasonable partner would ever let their partner fall asleep on a potentially allergic couch and not take them to bed.\n",

Both have been a bit of a failure to launch but going their own paths, neither have any financial obligations to anyone but themselves. My mum met my stepdad when I was 8 years old.

      "Body text: I (m15) randomly was told after my father (m45) came home from a drink at a bar that my mother (f41) went home with a random guy. I wa confused at first but then he told me how my mother was hanging on him and talking to him with a very suggestive tone. My father also said they were hushing up and shushing eachother whenever my dad would walk by them. Needless to say I was angry. My dad called my mom twice with no answer. My mother was quite the alcoholic and was drunk at the time but I don't think that disregards the issue. My dad then drove to the guys house with him saying that when he showed up my mother said \"I'm not with you anymore\" and that \"this was bound to happen\" with my dad then coming home and telling me. I then called my mother, first with no response then another time with her picking up. I had an hour long rant at her, and she was blaming me the whole time saying that I \"should've known\" and saying I was calling her a whore. (Side note: my dad had been a pretty bad guy 2 years ago but he had changed and My mom kept mentioning this as reasoning) My dad listened to the whole conversation and told me to relax several times yet I didn't. I'd rather not go into more detail just out of my own privacy and the unimportantance. I then didn't sleep all night with my father. When I woke up I had school and we crossed paths as she drove past me on my way to school. At school I was miserable and had to basically shut up the entire day which isn't usual for me. When I got home I awaited her and my fathers arrival which I recorded the whole interaction. My father was very helpful and forgiving while I was not. My mom said she'd been talking to this guy for a few months and that they'd kissed once. Also I found a text on her phone to him that day that said \"I just wish I could curl up with you.\" They both worked out saying that she just needed more attention and love while I felt I'd never view her the same. I have not much love for her anymore after this yet I feel like this is my fault and I shouldn't feel angry because of how everything being \"resolved\". I feel like I completely sort of \"disowned\" her but everything is practically like it never happened. Sorry about my sloppy writing and maybe confusing retelling. Am I the asshole?\n",

      "\n",
      "We had different childhoods… He and I grew up separately, leading very different lives. I was raised in a Christian household (I’m still a Christian) and he rejected religion about 12 years ago. Despite our differences we share a lot of common interests. I’ve always tried to use that as a way to connect with him. Personality-wise, we’re VERY different. I’m outgoing and take pride in my achievements, while he’s more reserved.

In my experience, networking is normal… I do it all the time with friends and colleagues. He saw it as an offence. He called me presumptuous for asking and stated that his plans were already set in stone. He reminded me that it’s my *words*, not my actions, that he doesn’t trust. When I apologized and explained that many people go to college to seek new opportunities, he doubled down, and said that I display “over-presumptuousness” and should reflect on the subtext of my words.\n",

      "Body text:  I am a 43yo woman and I have a friend Mike (41yo) man that is socially awkward, immature due to childhood abuse, and  insecure. Recently he broke up with his gf who felt threatened by me and thus I hadn’t seen him for several months. I put a lot of energy into consoling and helping him. He needed company to get his stuff back and I agreed to go with him. He asked me to use a different name so the ex wouldn’t know who I was (she hadn’t met me) and if I could pose as his legal representation to keep her at ease (yes I have the education for this) He told me we would be quick. When we got to her apartment, it was clear he wanted to talk to her for longer than he said and asked me to wait in the lobby. I waited for a half hour before I began to feel sick. He had texted me to hang tight as they were talking. I have some severe health problems and stupidly I hadn’t eaten or drank in 12 hours as he kept me busy. I also forgot my blood pressure pills. I circled the block three times to see if I’d feel better but no. I tried to go to a nearby store but had no money with me and my pills were in his house. I went back to the building and texted him- after no answer I called my bf who was a half hour away to get on the road. I called and texted my friend over and over to no avail- almost an hour now. I was having all the symptoms of a heart attack and I didn’t even know the address of where I was. I got in the elevator to go to where Mike was to try to communicate my problems and by now I am drenched with sweat, chest pain, extremities numbing, cognition impaired. When I got there, he was cuddling with her by the elevator and was dismissing me like he would do so for hired help like ‘thanks very much’ ‘that’s all’. I was waiting for him to notice my distress and was getting worse. I legit thought I was dying. In desperation and because it was clear he’d just used me to try to get back with her and I didn’t want to die with the last thing I did being lying to another girl about some guy- I said who I really was, got back in the elevator and passed out in the lobby. I came to with my bf yelling at Mike for not answering my calls and an ambulance rounding the corner. After it was all said and done I’d had a hypertension attack that almost caused cardiac arrest. My bf told me that the reason Mike didn’t answer my texts and calls was because if he pulled his phone out, his ex would see my name and know it was me. Next day, Mike came over and was furious with me and demanded to know why I couldn’t have thought of another way to get his attention and that I betrayed him. My bf screamed at him that his lie to the ex gf nearly killed me. Mike said he didn’t know I had high blood pressure (I did tell him) and I should have known he’d want to talk to her so he’d be longer than he initially said. My bf threw him out. I’m distraught because I have a very strict moral code for myself and  I’m going crazy with guilt. My bf says Mike was a totally oblivious inconsiderate tool. So AITA for blowing his cover?\n",

We are all on a softball team and we're planning stuff for the rest of the team (specifically the freshman's) to give them before we graduate.

It was getting close to a few days before our last softball game so we asked Becky if she would like to be in a group chat.

Becky has always been a popular girl and The Group and me have always been more of the quiet kids. i just really want to make sure i didn't accidentally do something that i didn't realize was bullying.

      "Body text: Hope everyone is having a better night than I am. Me and my roommate got into a big disagreement tonight over the state of her room. We are both in college, and she is home for summer. She has not started paying rent, and she moved in a month early and adopted a kitten without asking me, even though I own the house. Her name is nowhere on the papers or in a lease or anything, and she has been getting on my nerves with a bunch of demands that I don't think she has the right to make, especially since she hasn't paid a full month of rent. I was gone for about a week after we both left for summer to visit my parents, and I assumed she would have cleaned up her room and cats box before she left back to her house 6 hours away from us. However, when I got back today, the smell of cat poop and just overall stink was overwhelming me. I investigate where the smell is coming from, and find out it's coming from her bathroom. There is cat poop all over the floor, and not just a couple poop pebbles. I'm talking PILES all over the floor. And her room. Oh my gosh her room. It was such a mess you couldn't see the floor. This house has brand new carpet and she spilled foundation all over it. I was so upset that I just cleaned up all the poop because that's disgusting and I don't want my house to smell like poo, and I don't want pests. But wait, it gets worse. I start picking everything up off the floor, including piles of dirty clothes, trash, dishes, and busted makeup. Can you what I found? Cockroach babies. I lost it. I was so angry I rage cleaned the whole room and got all of her crap off of the floor and put away so no more spiders or roaches could hide in the heaps. I text her \"hey did you know that there was a bunch of cat poop on your bathroom floor?\" She replies \"no I didn't, and why were you in my bathroom? You need to ask before you go in my room.\" Which I would respect if 1. It wasn't affecting the entire house and 2. She was actually paying rent to live there. I say it's not a big deal and it was just really smelly in the house and I wanted to figure out where it was coming from. She again says I shouldn't be in there and I need to ask before I go in her room. I understand that, but AITAH for cleaning up her garbage and trying to keep my own house livable?  \n",

      "Body text: I (F22) am graduating from college in a few days and I am very excited! I sent out formal invitations to my family members and thought everything was fine until today. My mother called begging me to invite one of my cousins that was not included. This is my second cousin and although she is close to my parents, my aunts and uncles, and some other family members, she has made it clear many times that I am someone that she merely tolerates. Before I was of age, her excuse for not inviting me to gatherings was because I was too young. And now that I am “old enough” she still excludes me from gatherings that she hosts. I’ve voiced to my family that this hurts my feelings but that always goes no where. Or they say something along the lines of “you know how your cousin is, and her events aren’t even fun you wouldn’t want to be there anyway.” Because of this, I didn’t think it would be a big deal that I didn’t invite her, but I guess it is. She called my mother upset that she was excluded and my mom hates confrontation so she thinks this is an easy fix. I don’t want my mother to be put in a sticky situation with my cousin so I might just invite her to not start a fight, but I really don’t want her there. AITA??\n",

For context, I live with my mother and grandparents, my mom and grandmother are unemployed, my grandfather works, and I’m a college student. We live with a lot of pets already. It used to be just my mother and I, but it was awful. We would fight almost every day over stupid stuff.

Now her animals aren’t trained. They never use the bathroom outside, and my mother’s room is filthy as she doesn’t even do anything with these animals. She lays in her bed, puts down potty pads so they can go, and never walks them. Now I can forgive her for being sick, but she’s been in remission and has been going out more, even getting herself a horse (that she never sees). Despite this she always finds an excuse to lay in bed and watch TV all day, and of course argue with my grandparents. She will always say terrible things about them to me, yet denies hating them.\n",

She is about to head out on another vacation, my grandma will have to do even more work for an animal we’ve never even owned plus the untrained dogs, I have to study (summer classes), and my grandpa is working and all in all furious. \n",

She ended up not getting the prairie dog, and said that my grandparents and I have an “agenda” against her. She also refuses to see professionals about this stuff.\n",

I didn't need everyone else to not talk to him but I just didn't want to be asked to be nice to him I wanted distance.

The three of us had a great time. Clare came back a month later with her boyfriend and specifically asked for Sam again. From there, Sam got close with others in the server trading numbers, having girls’ nights, even getting engaged to one of the guys. They all started going clubbing more often.\n",

Still, we took him seriously, reassured him, invited him to more events, and checked in on him.\n",

Everyone's going to work. So, it can range from 40 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Now my father wants to ease up on the money they were giving him but my mom kept giving him money making their lives harder financially.\n",

Well while living with my parents my mom asked me to lend my car to Sam, he had wrecked his and I knew how it was to not have a car after an accident it happened to me so I let him borrow my car. Well with in two weeks he totaled my car while drunk or at least having an alcohol level above legal, well I was naive and let my mom convince me that my car had a faulty steering causing him to crash the fact he had a high alcohol level was because the cop was dirty; and I believed it. Well that wouldn't last long as after my parents had to move down to the city because my grandma on my mom's side needed family aid Sam got arrested for drinking and driving and this was his third offense, yeah the first car he worked was because he was drinking and driving. Oh and to make it worse at the time he had a new girlfriend who was 6 years younger then him and she was pregnant she wasn't in the car when it happened lucky enough but she still had to stress about her babies daddy going to jail. He managed to get off on parole, but started to ask us for help getting him to and from court and his parole meeting; and since my mom works most of the time that means I was taking him to court and those meetings. Oh and surprise my mom is still helping him pay expenses like bails while also offering me to help watch the baby.\n",

      "Which brings us to now, I lost my job as a caretaker for my father because he lost Medicaid do to my mom earning too much so I got myself an interview at a new job to hold me over till I find a more stable job. Well my mother and Sam are now both trying to guilt trip me into helping despite me no longer having a stay at home job like I did when I worked as a cartaker.

My dad did not like this idea, he said to me nothing he has bought is going anywhere near my mother's house. I said to him I don't see the point as nobody else lives here so it would sit to gather dust without anyone to use it. He told me I clearly don't understand the concept of divorce and I replied saying there is no point leaving it here. He then asked my step mother if she understands and she muttered under her breath, clearly not wanting to be in the convo \"Yep I understand...\" I said to him that he's just petty and I stormed off to my room. Posting here because I feel kinda bad and I don't know if what I said was right or not. TL;DR, Called my dad petty because he refused to let me donate my old PC to my sister living at my mum's house after their divorce.\n",

      "Body text: My bf and I have been together for 2 years, we're both 24. Last summer I got him a decently expensive model airplane set that you build yourself. It wasn't a birthday gift or for any special occasion, I just got it for us to build together because he's super into planes and has built a few sets before and I thought he would enjoy this. I also enjoy this stuff - I've helped him build planes and other things like Lego in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right after I showed it to him, he got excited and we started building it at my apartment. We got through about 1/4 and then called it a night. Ever since then I've suggested we continue and he says he wants to but when he comes over to do it he never \"feels like it\". I told him I don't really like that all the materials are lying around and taking up space for so long, I just want to put it together or at least put it away and he always says no no we'll do it soon. I asked him if we could take the stuff to his place but he always said he doesn’t have enough room (he still lives with his parents and doesn't have a lot of space in his room).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, my friend came over last night and she saw the set and thought it was super cool and we decided to finish building it together. We did another 1/4 and we planned for her to come over next week to do the rest. I told my bf about it today and he got pretty pissed off, saying this was something we were supposed to do together and how could I do it with someone else. I understand that I probably should have talked to him about it first before building any more of it with my friend but it feels like he doesn’t really care for this gift and I didn't want it just lying around. \n",

      "Body text: I just moved to Florida to my dream place on the beach and one of my best friends is pissed because she has claustrophobia and doesn't like flying. We're almost 60 and have known one another since we were 12. Grew up in Minnesota and when we were around 30, I moved to northern Colorado. She spent her career in MN but moved to WA with hubby. I found a place in Florida on the beach 2 years ago and have been remodeling and she has been somewhat supportive and we joke about Florida, because ya know, Florida. I have been coming to Florida since the early 80's as my dad lived here and I have family, and when I found a place on the beach I could afford I went for it. A week after I officially move in she tells me that I have put a barrier on our relationship because I moved to Florida. She says because of her claustrophobia of flying (she goes to Hawaii w/ hubby and friends, and her and I went to Mexico) that I am a bad friend and again did put a barrier on our relationship. I think her claustrophobia is the barrier, not me moving to my dream home. AITA for moving and not choosing my home based on whatever her claustrophobia requirement is?\n",

      "Body text: I just finished a semester at uni. Before I left my dad gave me a new suitcase to put my stuff in cause my old one was broken. It was one of the suitcases that wasn’t in use in our basement, but I was aware that it was my mom’s. Months later, I come home and she notices that I’ve been using her suitcase and gets very upset. She says it was disrespectful of us to use her suitcase without asking, which I agree with I guess.  I didn’t think it was that big of deal but I could tell that she was very upset and hurt by it, and obviously I would never want to make my mom feel that way. The suitcase is still very clean and I plan on taking it to the dry cleaners this week, but I still feel really guilty. It is a very nice suitcase and pretty expensive (it’s TUMI brand if anyone is wondering) and I understand she was saving it to use herself on vacation or something. She kinda mentioned wanting a new one so I might just offer to save up and by her one to replace it because I don’t want her to feel like I don’t care about the situation, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting and it’s actually not that big of a deal.

She moved down south once my dad died, remarried, and then her health started to decline so she came back up north. Since she's been living with me and my daughter. The process of getting the services started took months until she was hospitalized. Since I've done everything i could possibly do to make sure she is comfortable. I at one point even moved out of my room and slept on a couch for over a year to make sure i didn't disrupt my daughter's life as well. Today i was going out to pick up some lunch for myself, as i was walking out, my mom waited for me to essentially leave so she can start talking shit about me, about how i don't want to take care of her and i only like the money. for context i have an older sister who lives less than 10 minutes away and hasn't seen our mom since her birthday in February. my mom even called my sister and asked her to bring her a salad (the day before mother's day) and my sister said no she was already in the house. atp i am fed up. my mom neglected me my ENTIRE life. she did the bare minimum to take care of me, made sure she dotted on my sister and left me to survive on my own. from middle school thru high school, i bounced around from friend's house to the next. my sister was verbally, and emotionally abusive, (when was i 7 she ess'ad me) and yes, i do go to therapy to work through all of this, but this constant reminder of how much i don't wanna take care of my mom, I'VE HAD ENOUGH. i don't sleep, barely eat, my self hygiene isn't the best and my mental is declining. FAST. I made the necessary phone calls to get this process started because i refuse to allow this woman to remind me of how much she never actually wanted to be MY MOM.....so reddit AITA?\n",

      "I (20F) and my sister (17F) are very close, largely because we bonded over how controlling and inconsistent our parents were. They enforced senseless rules just because they could, while maintaining the illusion that everything was normal. When I was 14, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a tight-knit friend group that felt like a second family. I loved and trusted them deeply, but midway through senior year, they suddenly cut me off and spread rumors about me. Why? Because my parents tracked my phone, and my mom told one of their moms about us going somewhere without permission. They thought I was the snitch. That incident defined the rest of senior year—I had to rebuild my identity and learn to be independent. It also meant no senior trip for me because I had no one to go with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing up, our parents made us believe we were broke, even though we were middle class. They spent our college tuition on renovating the kitchen and living room. I became extremely frugal, working as a minor to pay for my clothes, food, and essentials. Now, I’m in a good college for digital art and animation. I pay my own tuition, rent, and gas. My parents cover my phone bill and car insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, I noticed my mom buying my sister expensive clothes that filled her closet. When I asked why she didn’t do the same for me, my mom said she “doesn’t like my style.” So I used their card to buy some clothes I needed and got scolded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came my sister’s birthday. They took her and two friends to the beach. For mine, I got a cake and a book. I didn’t complain. But now they’re planning her senior trip: $1,800 for her, and $3,200 each for my parents to join her in the Bahamas. I’m stunned. I’m barely making rent and living like a broke student. Even when I had a senior trip planned (before the friend fallout), it was going to be max $500—just for me, not them.\n",

      "When I brought this up, they blew up. They called me ungrateful and threatened to cut off the little support I still receive. They brought up the phone and insurance bills as leverage. Meanwhile, my sister totaled her last car, and they still bought her a brand-new one. Mine is from 2014. They said I had a chance to do a senior trip. I didn’t get to go because of my friends. But it was my mother who caused me to lose those friends.\n",

He then would precede to only to order for him and her which was extremely okay because I had told him that I would be making enough to feed everybody whether or not Ryan and Cassie had planned to eat with us or not. Half an hour later while making it my children's well balance plates of grains veggies and protein the pizza arrived. To which ryan carried it in set it on the kitchen table where I was already making my children's plates, and proceeded to make his own plate, Carrie proceeded to make her own plate while my five and six year old watched them make plates of delivery pizza. Ensuing them to reject and outright decline eating any of the meal I had spent the last hour preparing not only for them but myself. then Ryan and Carrie take their own plates to their bedroom to then shut the door and proceed to enjoy their meal. I will say that I am not in any way upset or disparaged that they ordered an ate their own pizza I don't care.

      "Body text: Hi fellow Redditors! I was hoping to get some opinions on this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I 29F am getting married to my fiance in October 2025 and we're very excited! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to get married in North Carolina as it was  more affordable for us than Massachusetts or Florida where some of my/his family live.\n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance's mother lives in North Carolina and offered to host a dinner/reception party for both of our families the night before the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for context, my grandmother raised me so I consider her like my mother, and we're very close.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my grandma about the dinner/reception party, she proceeded to demand that we keep the count small to not overwhelm my side of the family (which my fiancee/his mother agreed to keep it at 10-15 people), but then decided she wanted my fiancee's mother  to change the party to a different day entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not possible as my fiancee has family coming from out of state late Friday evening (as do I) so Saturday night is really the only day we can host everyone to say thank you for coming as our wedding is on a Sunday.\n",

      "My grandmother hit the roof when I told her we couldn't change the day, stating she wanted to have an intimate dinner with \"just my family\" Saturday night and that it's tradition to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I offered to have a brunch earlier that day with just my side of the family to compromise, she declined, stating she would just get HER family to go to their own dinner Saturday without me, that she would tell my family that I didn't want to see them, and that I better not DARE invite my family to the dinner/reception my fiance's mom was hosting Saturday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I reiterated that I was willing to host a brunch with just my side of the family, she told me I need to make sure I don't interfere with her family, or their plans that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiancee texted her asking why she's trying to punish me for not moving the day of the dinner, to which she started screaming, got into my face, called my fiance a motherfucker, said he can't treat her that way, she doesn't consider him family, and that she hates him. I had to ask her to leave my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she's been sending both of us nasty text messages stating we're selfish, she only wants one day with her family, etc. \n",

      "Title: WIBTA if I uninvite two of my partner's \"friends\" from my birthday party?\n",
      "Body text: Hi. I'm having a problem with two of my partner Rob's friends. They are a couple, Seth and Amy, early 30s. (fake names)\n",
      "\n",
      "Rob and I had a huge fight while on vacation recently. We have since started couples therapy and are doing fantastic. The problem I'm having is with Seth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rob considers Seth one of his closest friends. I like them but I am not close with them. We see them out at bars only, they never speak (calling or texting). Seth has never invited Rob to spend time with him, we don't do couple hangs, we literally only see them randomly when we're out. They don't share life experiences like friends do, hang out, chat, share meals, get coffee, grab drinks, honestly nothing. To be fair, I've never seen Rob put any effort into this \"friendship\" either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before this fight we had, I invited Seth and Amy to my bday party (it's a big event, I sent free tickets to everyone I invited, including them). I really only did it as a favor to Rob. I think they're cool, but they're not MY friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "So after Rob and I get back from vacation right after this fight, Rob gets drinks with Seth, as you do with friends, for perspective, support, etc. This is the first time Rob made actual plans with him since we’ve been dating (\\~1 year).  Rob comes back the next day and vaguely says they discussed said fight. I have no idea exactly what Rob told Seth, I didn't feel like it was my place to ask at the time. It was a terrible and scary fight and it took us weeks to reconcile and understand each other. I assumed that Rob only told Seth his side of it. Later Rob told me that Seth said something wildly offensive about how I treated Robt, which felt completely untrue. But I felt telling Rob that I thought this was inaccurate was wrong. He is entitled to his experience and we both had an awful one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main issue. When we see Seth and Amy now, Seth is weird to me, standoffish, awkward, gives me weird looks, or ignores me. Honestly, I am fine with this, I still treat him kindly and make conversation. The problem I'm having now is what to do about my bday party. I do not want someone who thinks such awful things about me to be there. I want to uninvite Seth but feel super uncomfortable about it. I don’t like penalizing Amy for something Seth did, but uninviting just him would be weird. I feel like my only option is to uninvite them both and explaining why, not only to them but to Rob, which sounds terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "WIBTA if I uninvite them because what Seth said about me was fucked up and wrong? Doing so also makes me feel like I'm invalidating Rob’s understanding and feelings about what happened. I just don't know. Should I just let them come and not even think about it? I don't want this guy to think he can just say bullshit about me and it's fine. And I kind of want the tickets that I paid for back if that's what he thinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I want to uninvite my partner’s “close” friend from my birthday party because of what he said about me after a fight my partner and I had.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: sorry reddit, I fixed the name issue, was just trying to cut down on characters and that one got missed. Also, when we see this couple out, it usually with a big group of their friends. So I'm not really talking to Seth, just around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "EDIT 2: this was super helpful. I'm going to leave the invite standing, maybe they don't come, and just tell Rob how I'm feeling. Thinking through things again, I hardly see Seth so oh well.\n",

      "Body text: So long story short my sister (25F) took my youngest neice in for a swollen arm. Turns out my 7 WEEK OLD neice had 5 fractures! And the other 2 yr old niece had brusing! And CPS took them. They are now placed with me and have been for about 2 months now. The poor babies have nightmares and I have asked the 2 yr old \"who was it\" after a nightmare and she told me \"daddy\" Now my sister and her BD (26M) Have had a history of DV and I feel one of them did it to the poor 7 week old. I have had problems with my sister making threats to me saying \"she'll get what's coming to her once I get my kids.\" And CPS seems to keep overlooking things like that saying \"I should just leave it alone.\" She thinks I took them in to spite her when in reality they needed a home to go to. I didn't want them to going into foster. She has tried to keep food stamps for herself and WIC. I had to go file for them since she wasn't going to help. We had to buy practically a whole new wardrobe for the 2 yr old since all her clothes were in a closet with rat poop. I just want what's best for these girls and I am not sure going back is what's best. I have seen first hand how they tell my niece to be quite or they'll beat her A**. And I now know they meant it. I don't feel like the Ahole but my whole family is against me and all I have is my Fiance, my mom, my aunt, and my other sister. AITA for taking in my nieces when no one else would??\n",

      "Body text: Hi there, I [29M] have been on a shared car insurance plan with the rest of my family since getting it out of college. I technically do own my car, and for a long time was the only one who drove it. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, as of mid-2023 this has no longer been the case as my mom let her lease expire and now uses it as well. This mostly hasn't really been an issue as I have spent the bulk of that time since then out of the country, during which I have not used any car. During this time, I told them they could take me off of insurance, and they did not do so for whatever reason. I have been back for the last 6 months, but we coordinate on usage and it's been fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, my folks understandably now want to change the plan so everyone has their own plan to save money. I totally understand this, am grateful they did it up to this point frankly, and don't expect them to pay for me to drive that or any car.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I'm leaving the country in 3 days for a longer period (anywhere between 2-5 months at least) and don't think it makes sense for me to pay insurance on a car that I will not be using and don't have full autonomy over anyway. I figure I'll get insurance if/when I return and need to use a car again, and can deal with it accordingly if it comes up. On the other hand, I imagine they may counter with the fact that they paid for it for me up until now and I'm not reciprocating, which is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways: am I the asshole for not wanting to pay car insurance for this car I'm not using? Should I just suck it up and reciprocate what they've been doing? Am curious\n",

      "Body text: First real post on reddit glad to be here I 19M recently moved to my local state college and had to get a random roommate which I didn't think was gonna be a problem. When I met this dude 18M for the first time he looked perfectly fine, if not tidy. His hair was slicked back and he had a full suit on like your generic business major. No immediate red flags just a dapper young gent. That was until maybe 2 weeks in , for context we live in a shitty two bed 500 sqft apartment and we only have ONE BATHROOM keep that in mind. So one night through our paper-thin walls I hear this dude smacking it yk, yanking the chain, choking the chicken, cranking the hog. Mind you I do not care, who doesn't every now and then, but my problem begins when I go to brush my teeth in the morning and am met with splooge every. fucking. where. In the sink, around the sink wherever bust can hide. This naturally disgusts me and I barge into his room and tell him as such. He doesn't take blame he instead tries to convince me for like 5 minutes that we have a ghost and what I saw in the bathroom was ectoplasm. I told him I heard him and he stuck by his story so I conceded and just let it be hoping this scare would make him more cautious. I was wrong, if anything it just empowered him. He started doing the same thing in different spots of the house to sell me on his story and when I would confront him he would talk about this nonexistent ghost. Finally I was done and one night I caught him pants down in the kitchen rubbing one out. I yelled and told him he needed help and thats when he broke down, he told me about his past. His family were some weird religious fanatics and would beat him if they ever found out at home so he never cranked it. I felt so bad I haven't even talked to the dude since then I mean we don't need to talk but it made our living situation super awkward. I dont get what drove him to this it just makes no sense how could you possibly think I believed you and why would you KEEP BUSTING NUTS. Im about to move out now and I haven't seen him leave his room in a while should I try and apologize? or is this too crazy should I just get out of here and never look back. \n",

(I don't remember what it is but it's not arthritis and is a long complicated name) And occasionally she'll just start h her leg out and say \"Could you please do squeezey foot for Mama\" (I'm a teenager but she refuses to cut the baby talk at any point in the future) and I'll either groan in disgust because I don't like touching feet, especially not her dry papery skin due to sensory sensitivity, or in frustration and exhaustion because sometimes that can be the 5th trivial thing in a row she asked me to do. I used to do every. Single. Thing. Every little request I would fulfill because \"well she has joint and nerve pain I can't just go against my morals and not help someone who needs it\" It was exhausting. It was humiliating and occasionally very overstimulating. If I don't for ANY valid or invalid reason she'll make this like? Scoff/cough kinda sound??? And then whine like a child until I do it. Over the past year I believe I have decided to not do it because I don't feel like I should have to and it makes me really uncomfortable. She knows it does and will still complain until I do it. I really don't like touching feet and it makes me really upset that I HAVE to do these things otherwise I loathe myself when she has persistently neglected me throughout my childhood. She tried to always have me do things because I learn things and master skills fairly quickly and can be easily to guilt trip. It's hard to say no because I end up having thoughts about how unworthy I am of basic needs because I couldn't just give up that little snobbish behavior and do her a small favor. It just doesn't feel small. It never has. Not even when she first made me scratch and massage her feet when I was five. She would occasionally have me grasp her foot and pull (basically stretch) her leg out for her. \"Scratchy foot\" \"squeezey foot\" \"pulley foot/pulley leg\" She has had me massage her hands too, but that is rare and far between compared to the feet and I don't mind massaging hands. I just make myself feel bad about it because she'll whine and I'll just be stoic and upset and say \"I don't want to touch your feet. I don't like touching feet. I've told you that.\"\n",

I'd prefer if this was cleared or if I could try to contact them myself but she's never gonna give me the account number so either I will have to withhold her deposit somehow if they bill us or get her to agree to pay any retroactive bills (but she won't want to, she'll again just say 'tell them I moved out'), so I'm at a bit of a loss here.

Leah is of the age now were she is part of leaving care and has a social worker until she turns 25 because of health issues,  Diana is still in care in a unit that only houses a few children at a time as of her anger issues. \n",

Apparently Diana turned up to Leah’s house a week prior to this call on drugs and couldn’t stand so Leah left her on the stairs to grab her phone and call a taxi to take her to her mums house, worst mistake she ever did as the spare key to the property was on the windowsill next to her. Ever since we have been trying to find the key but never have and now we know were it went. Apparently there is photos of kids in Leah’s property getting high and partying when she’s not there, Diana has been selling the key to kids so she can use the money to get high herself and we found out it’s the hardcore stuff. That day I stayed with Leah as she was scared someone was going to turn up, we got the locks changed and called the police.  Now me and Leah are getting shit from our family because we called the police and changed the locks. Keep in mind Leah works full time and has a child of her own 7 (f). \n",

      "Body text: I (20M) live in a shared student flat in Scotland with 3 other people (22F, 21M, 26M), the 26M (we’ll call him Tom) moved into our flat in January. \n",
      "When he moved in he was made aware that on the first day of the month every month is when our gas and electric is paid, we pay a fixed amount but depending on our usage it could be increased or decreased every 3 months. After he moved in our energy usage doubled and subsequently in March, our energy bills increased by 20% overall, we had multiple notices and discussions about our usage prior to this and again as a result of this event but every time he didn’t say a word and just ignored us. \n",
      "Fast forward to April 30th, I ask in our flat group chat for everyone’s monthly payment (£55 each, about 70-75USD), everyone knows the payment is due on the 1st so this message is just a courtesy. My 22F and 21M flatmates send me the money but Tom told me the next day he couldn’t because of a bank holiday (he is Swiss and refused to open an account in Scotland or use a service such as Revolut). I said that was okay and a couple of days later I asked again and he told me I should’ve asked earlier, which I can understand but I don’t think I should need to remind an almost 30 year old man to pay his bills every month. \n",
      "Following this I reminded him that the bills are paid on the same day and I will say I was annoyed at this point and told him that asking earlier wouldn’t make a difference as he’s had multiple days but hasn’t paid which I think might make me the asshole. He then responded basically just insulting me and my intelligence telling me that because I’m Scottish I’m basically an idiot and know nothing about the real world, my 21M flatmate supported me and told Tom that it is his own responsibility to account for any variables when making his payment as he would’ve had to with our landlord which was again met with insults, blaming us and telling us to be more like him. \n",
      "21M tried to explain that Tom should put himself in my position and tried to come to a reasonable solution by suggesting in future just give notice of any situations like this that could cause issues with payments, this was met with ignorance, followed by once again blaming us and calling us disrespectful as there were two used plates and a small pot left beside our kitchen sink (to clarify these were not dirty or smelly they were just used) and I understand that can be annoying but I was away from the flat and could not wash my pot (the two plates were 21M’s). This was followed once again by him blaming us and telling us it’s ridiculous to chase a small amount of money when there are 3 dishes in the kitchen - £55 to me is not a small amount and goes a long way. \n",
      "Our other flatmate 22F later attempted to try and be reasonable and asked him for maturity but was met with more insults towards us and told us his time is too valuable to waste on us. \n",

      "Body text: I (F31) play volleyball in a mixed team, where both males and females play. I'm generally not a starter, but this season I've been improving and spent more time on the court as a libero. On my team plays a guy my age, Bill, whose technique is very good, but he has a bad temper and often misses when he gets riled up. Despite this, he's our best hitter, so he plays a lot.\n",

      "A couple days ago there  was a friendly game and our coach couldn't make it there, so we had another player, Theo, coaching in her stead. We weren't doing our best and Bill was missing a lot of points. After we lost our first set, I came up to him and told him in what I thought was a friendly manner to snap out of it and do his own thing (something like \"stop doing tips, they're not working\"). He immediately raised his voice, telling me to shut my mouth and leave him alone, that I had no right to speak to him. He was super aggressive and I was really shaken and pissed, because it's a team effort to win and I always try to encourage my teammates.\n",

Bill kept addressing me aggressively, repeating that I shouldn't speak to him. After that I started crying because I was really taken aback by his reaction and I felt like not even Theo had my back. Bill got benched for the second set, while I kept playing, even if it took me a couple of minutes to get back on track. In the end, we lost 1-2.\n",

      "After the match, some of my teammates told me that I should have known that Bill would react like that and that I shouldn't take it personally because that's just the way it is. Other teammates told me that he's reaction was over the top and that it wasn't my fault. Bill came to apologise, but he also told me that I shouldn't \"provoke\" him, which doesn't sound like a great apology to me. I feel conflicted, I knew of his temper and I'm sure that he snapped because he was mad with himself and how he was playing, but I was just trying to help him get back on his feet and instead things just escalated.\n",
      "That was our last match together since I'll be moving to another city for work and the whole situation left a sour taste in my mouth and I'm still wondering if it was really my fault because I \"provoked\" him.\n",

      "Body text: I (20F) have been in a relationship with my bf (20M) for 10 months now. Out of those 10 months, 9 of them were long distance with different time zones as I attended a college in another state. I decided during the last semester that I wanted to live back home and go to school there. My mother has never wanted me to date and told me that once I get to college I can date… then I got to college and she told me I needed to get my degree first. Obviously, that didn’t happen, and I am still very much in love with my boyfriend. When she found out around 7-8 months ago she was completely against it and told me that she’d cut me off financially (take me off her insurance, take my car and bring it back, etc.) and told me that she wouldn’t be my mother anymore if I continued to be in this relationship. It seemed a bit exaggerated and eventually that just drizzled out to be a bluff of some sort. \n",

I have come to visit him during our relationship and stayed with his family for days at a time and she knows this. Tonight I asked to stay the night because his little sister hadn’t seen me in a while and asked to have a girls night (sleepover, forts, movies). She told me no, but recently I have been trying to stand my ground and create boundaries. I told her that I understand that this is all new to her, but that this is part of growing up and making decisions for myself. I said that this won’t be a weekly thing, but that I wanted to stay and don’t want her to ignore me or threaten to abandon me in one way or another for it. \n",

It comes to four in the afternoon and she still hasn’t left. That’s fine with me because I’m chill. We plan for her to stay tonight as well. Again that’s fine I don’t mind.

An hour or so into her coming back she turns around to me and says “oh bobs coming round.” So I turn in confusion and say “what” my friend then explain how he’s coming over and staying the night. Bear in mind she didn’t ask for my permission for him to come and stay. I’m really pissed at this point and trying to hide my anger. I’m not a person who likes confrontation. I’m holding back tears. The boyfriend comes round and we have a good time and I’m trying to hint him to leave. Like I said before I don’t like confrontation and I don’t like telling people stuff as it is. (I have autism and have always found it hard to tell people stuff as I’m scared they will find me rude. Sometimes in the past I will say something I think is normal and kind but it has come off in a wrong way.)I explain to him my dad said it’s okay for him to stay but not sleep the night. The boyfriend calls for a taxi but none are answering so he’s kind of stuck here. So now I’m going to be in big trouble when my parents get home.\n",

She also told me that she doesnt trust me because of things i did in the past but she doesnt even remember it, during the convo i also brought up how she also has her own coping mechanisms(she has a bunch of scars). she told me i couldnt compare \"insulting her in my diary to things she did to herself\" which is crazy but ok.

If pets can be a soul mate then she was mine.  \n",

I finally make it back to the motel and I was sniffling but not full on crying as I entered the room. My friend's mom was pissed that I woke her up to get in the room and was making snide remarks under her breath like \"Jesus Christ\" and \"Get a hold of yourself\". The final straw was when her little shi tzu dog was on my bed so I gently pushed him to the side so I had room to sit down and she just had to say \"Get over here.

I looked carefully at the group photos and, she was in the centre of every one she was in. I DID crop some photos because I wanted to remove someone who's no longer considered a friend of the group, but she was no where near the area cropped.

      "Body text: I am a 43yo woman and I have a friend Mike (41yo) man that is socially awkward, somewhat immature due to childhood abuse, and very insecure. Recently he broke up with his gf who felt threatened by me and thus I didn’t see him for several months. I put a lot of my energy into consoling and helping him. He decided he needed company to get his stuff back and I agreed to go with him. He asked me to use a different name so the ex wouldn’t know who I was (she hadn’t met me) and if I could pose as his legal representation to keep her at ease (yes I have the education for this) He told me we would be very quick so I just hopped in his car and we went. When we got to her apartment, it was clear he wanted to talk to her for longer than he said and asked me to wait in the lobby. I waited for about a half hour before I began to feel sick. He had texted me to hang tight as they were talking. I have some severe health problems and stupidly I hadn’t eaten or drank much in 12 hours as he needed my support. I also forgot my blood pressure pills, my SSRIS and my benzo. I circled the block three times to see if I’d feel better but got worse. I tried to go to a nearby store but had no money with me and my pills were in his house. I went back to the building and texted my friend and after no answer I called my bf who was a half hour away but would get on the road. I called and texted my friend over and over to no avail- almost an hour now. I was having all the symptoms of a heart attack and realized I didn’t even know the address of where I was. I got in the elevator to go to where my friend was to try to communicate my problems and by now I am drenched with sweat, chest pain, extremities numbing, cognition impaired. When I got there, he was cuddling with her by the elevator and he kept dismissing me like he would do so for hired help like ‘thanks very much’ ‘that’s all’. I was waiting for him to notice my distress and was getting worse and worse. I thought I was dying. In desperation and because it was clear he’d just used me to try to get back with her and I didn’t want to die with the last thing I did being lying to another girl about some guy- I said who I really was, got back in the elevator and passed out in the lobby five minutes later. I came to with my bf yelling at my friend for not answering my calls and the ambulance rounding the corner. After it was all said and done I’d had a hypertension attack that almost caused cardiac arrest. They wanted me to go to the hospital but I wanted to go to sleep and they made me an early morning doc appt. I got my stuff and went home. My bf told me that the reason my friend didn’t answer my texts and calls was because if he pulled his phone out, his ex would see my name and know it was me. Next day, my friend came over and was furious with me and demanded to know why I couldn’t have thought of another way to get his attention and I utterly betrayed him. My bf screamed at him that his lie to the ex gf nearly killed me. Mike said that he didn’t know I had high blood pressure (I did tell him) and that I should have known he’d want to talk to her so he’d be longer than he initially said. My bf threw him out. I’m distraught because I have a very strict moral code for myself and I feel like I’m going crazy with guilt. My bf says Mike was a totally oblivious inconsiderate tool. So AITA for blowing his cover?\n",

      "Body text: I can't tell if I am acting crazy but this kind of thing really gets to me. I don't like wasting money, I have always been frugal and smart about spending and that extends to money being spent on me as well. My mom was looking into buying me a new bra because she saw that I only really like wearing one even though she has gotten me like 5 of them. I'm very picky about what I wear. To me it has to fit and sit just right which is why I pretty much just wear the same one. I explained this to her, I even said don't get me anything I am very happy with what I have right now. The following day we look online for them same bra I like but just in a different colour, they are sold out of my size though, I tell my mom I don't want any other size, if we get another bra it has to be exactly like this one. I told her the size up won't work please don't get that. A few days later she tells me she got me a bra, im excited for a second until she tells me she got it in the size I told her not to get. I get frustrated and I walk out. I come back to give the bra a shot maybe it will still fit. But to no surprise it doesn't fit and actually doesn't even remotely fit me, the fit was so terrible I became even more frustrated. Bra shopping for me is very hard because I have a smaller frame and larger breasts so it's a job to find something that fits my body. So I am angry at my mom for not listening to me and wasting a good amount of money on something we can't return. These bras are expensive and I wish she had just listened and waited for my correct size to come back in. I also know she was coming from a good place but in my head I just need her to admit she shouldn't have got that size but she won't admit it instead she deflects by saying she will keep it or she will alter it, but I know it won't fit her either. I just need her to admit she should have listened or to just show me in some sort of way that she understands why I am frustrated. Please give me an outside perspective.\n",

      "Body text: I (27) and my partner (27) bought a house in 2023. We bought it with the intention and verbal commitment from a friend of ours to stay for 2 years. Alas they moved out in May of 2024 - that's a whole other story that's a gd mess. Anyway, my partner and I began looking for a roommate through an LGBTQ+ Facebook group. We found one of someone moving back to the state from another state. They (28) had already had a job lined up for when they moved in. They're a spectacular roommate and a lovely human, truly. But they've never been able to make a full payment of rent. A few months back we spoke to them about a payment plan. We also recently discussed adding late fees and interest on late payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me be clear here, we have never done a lease with anyone before. They had never given us any red flags during the interview process and so we had no reason to believe they wouldn't be able to pay rent. In our original lease, we didn't have late fees in it. Yes, obviously we were naive and made a massive mistake. But we're learning as time goes on. When it reached the point that they owed us ~ $5k in late/overdue rent, we amended the lease and created a payment plan. This included the late fees ($25/missed payment) and interest (0.75%). Part of that plan was bi-monthly payments to help them be caught up to paying off their debt come January 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today marks their 2nd payment since the payment plan was initiated and they still haven't had a full payment. We didn't even get half of the payment for the 1st one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where it gets tricky. They have been deeply unfortunate with jobs here. The one they had lined up when they moved here wasn't giving them enough hours so they found a second job and then quit that. At this one they're making ~ $14/hr and not really working full time. They had a second job where they were making ~ $18/hr but got laid off. Now they're at another job and they're making $12/hr, also very part time. They have multiple chronic illnesses that have made it hard for them to make it to work and have had to call out frequently. It's been really hard as a friend to watch. They've been a really awesome friend and roommate. But to put it bluntly, as a tenant they're pretty bad. They've had a lot of family issues as well and their mental health has really been in the shitter, especially with the political climate. My partner and I are very forgiving, patient, and I believe kind people..but we feel as though we're being stupid due to the track record. \n",

I would make the drive if she ever asked. She got mad at me and went off on me in the messages for telling her mom that she didn’t want to be a burden but I didn’t see it that way. I genuinely do care about her and do not see her as a burden. \n",

      "Now we are in the same friend group which consists of 6 girls and 1 boy. We’ve been going on vacations together since 2 years ago. Like any other year we wanted to go again this year. It took a while but we finally had a date to plan the trip. We brainstormed and I suggested Albania. Alice said she did not want a beach holiday. Okay fine so we looked further. Someone suggested Belgium near a big city so we could plan a few nights out. She complained she did not want to be in a flat near the city because we would need a bigger space or else we would argue. Okay fine we looked further suggested a camping site but no, she didn’t want to camp in a tent. Final suggestion somewhere in between 2 big cities in a big house so we could still plan a few nights out. Alice freaked and said she wouldn’t come with if we were planning on going out. A few of my friends begged her to come with so she decided to stay. We atleast planned a date for the trip so everyone would have enough time to arrange the stuff with their jobs. After that Alice decided we needed a break and we would plan it another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have another little group of friends in my class with who I was planning a short trip. So I planned it a week after we were planning to go with the friend group. But before we booked the flight I texted Alice to make sure I was not planning a double vacation. She texted me the exact dates that I would go on vacation with my classmates. I did not believe her so I threw a quick message in the group chat with the same question. Conclusion: Alice had requested the “wrong date” off from work and it was our fault somehow so we couldn’t go on holiday anymore.\n",

When we where younger we had silly little childish dramas as young immature people do but we put it behind us. Anyways id say about 3 years ago Jessica knowingly flirted and hooked up with my boyfriend at the time, I of course broke of the relationship and friendship but afterwards she got really weird, stalked me and harrased me, I got a restraining order on her because it so bad. \n",

In highschool (I was 14 and she was 17) a guy she liked, that I didn't know she liked, flirted with me and tried hooking up with me, but because I was still a virgin than and wasn't comfortable with sex or anything of that nature I turned him away. She found out and went full rage mode. Screaming that I was an awful friend and the works really. I apologised even tho I felt I hadn't done anything wrong since I didn't know she liked this guy and I had turned him down anyways. But after a bit, she forgave me and life went on. \n",

      "Body text: I live in a cannabis legal state and grow my own. My brother blew up on me and says I'm an asshole because I told him I didn't want to grow a plant for him if he bought me seeds and fertilizer. There are several reasons for this which all seem to go in one ear and out the other with him:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1. I don't have the space. If we were talking about throwing a seed in a spare pot and throwing the plant in an unused corner of my tent and giving it water and a bit of care, that'd be one thing and I'd have no problem with that. He wouldn't even need to supply me with anything. But the reality is I grow in a small 4x4 tent in a one bedroom apartment. The tent is in my bedroom and it is a pretty cramped space. Often I will only grow 2-3 plants on a run to make accessing the plants & controlling the environment easier. And at most it is 4. So this means giving him somewhere between 25-50% of my reward for months of effort and sacrifice for like a couple hundred bucks of supplies max.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Buying me seeds and fertilizer (which I already have plenty of both anyways) is a pittance compared to the entirety of the costs of time & money needed to grow for myself. It takes a ton of effort over months and sacrifices like sleeping next to a noisy, bright tent several months out of the year to grow my own. And while supplies for each new run are decently cheap, the setup cost me dearly and I’m only on my 4^(th) run so haven’t even “recouped the costs” all that much yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. I grow pretty much what I need until my next harvest plus a bit more for sharing. And I’ve been plenty generous with him. It isn’t like me giving him such a significant portion of my harvest would simply go unnoticed.\n",

I say this to show I don't really get along with him that often. He got a pool shortly after moving in and  Not even 2 summers after moving in and setting up the pool, it messed up. About 1 summer passes and he decides he wants to fix it. Now, I am willing to help him, and I said I would but I have 1 pre-requisite.\n",

I don't want to be rude and just ignore his wants and needs, but at the same time, I don't want to be a jelly spined person who gets walked all over with the slightest bit of push back.

For context, I’m very self-aware in the sense that I tend to get very attached to people and prioritize them completely. I had even distanced myself from my old friends to be there for her. So when she stopped talking to me, I felt hurt and abandoned. We talked it out, kind of fixed things, but this pattern repeated every few months.\n",

She was really emotional, apologized, and said she wished I’d told her sooner. After that, I tried to be more open with her, but the hot-and-cold behavior continued. Sometimes we were super close, other times she’d completely ghost me — which made my mental state worse.\n",

Knowing I needed to keep track I bought a new one and didn't mention it out of embarrassment and I guess a sence of failure. My partner noticed it in the bathroom and brought it up I said I bought a new one because the old one stopped working for me. He asked how much it was and got abit upset at the answer. And complained that I could have justed used to old one until I lost the weight again and it came back on. He said I should use it as motivation like a goal, we shouldnt be spending money on things like that. I got upset and said he was being insensitive and that how was I supposed to lose weight if I didn't know how much I weighed. He said its coming across as defeatist and he doesn't see the point. I at this point walked away to hid and cry. Later on he came in to talk saying he was sorry for making me cry but he I'm being a bit of a arsehole by not talking to him about the purchase first.

My wife spoke to him (her nephew 27) and after weeks (months) of text and phone call exchanges he managed to get an invitation to our home from Hawaii. He does not have money or anything to his name. The thing is, it has been 3 weeks now and he had broken every rule possible including common sense rules that don’t need to be explained (like taking a daily 2hr shower) or tossing 5 things into the dishwasher and running that load with half of the things not being dishwasher safe, breaking multiple items on the house. Being picky about stuff we have purchased for his personal use like wanting only organic toiletries or over priced items etc. anyhow it’s been almost a month and it finally got to the point where my wife confronted him about these things and he got upset and started talking bad about me and our adult daughters (23/21) and their boyfriends (23/23)who spend the weekends at our home. We asked him to leave and now he has spent an entire day and night in our front porch. He slept on the floor outside. He claims he has nowhere to go or knows anyone that he can ask for help.  He accuses my wife of misleading him to thinking that we were going to help him pay back for the money he borrowed to get himself to our home, that we would give him money to get settled in and hire him as her assistant (when she has made it clear that her assistant needs to have a reliable transportation) something he does not have here in California. We have warned him that we would be calling the police on him and still he will not leave our property. We did end up calling the police but they advised us that since we invited him into our home now we has the right to squad in our property and we now have to file a restraining order against him and file an eviction order and take him to court so that they can legally ask him to leave our premises.  I don’t know what to do at this point.  Just need some advice. I’ve tried talking to him 3 times and all 3 times he won’t own up to all his mistakes and talking bad about us or even apologize for what he has done because in his mind he has not done anything wrong. We are really stuck in this situation since he has no other family members here in So. Cal. Or friends. \n",

We were talking and i was telling her about a fight i had with my dad (Maybe I'll post about it another time) and anyway, the local valley/mountain was playing a role. She and Dan love going there but me? Eh, no. I got bad experiences there! Anyway, first red flag. She IMMEDIATELY asked if we could go there and I said no. Explaining my reasoning (Basically trauma dumping) and she let it go. Afterwards, we went to a café nearby to get something to eat. And low and behold, we bumped into Dan. We started catching up and he ended up joining us. All good and nice until Sasha asks if we could go again, now that Dan was here. Dan was super excited (He didn't know about my bad experiences there so I don't really blame him). Anyway, i ended up giving in not to ruin the mood so we went. Honestly... It was fine. I was really anxious and not really talking but overall good. We stayed there for a while but it was starting to get dark after like an hour so we decided to start heading back. I wanna say here that Dan and Sasha like running, jumping up and down like goats and stuff and it's tiring to try and catch up so i gave up after a while and let them wait for me when i was too far behind. Anyway, the guys decided to go a way back that i didn't really know so i was hesitant but ended up going anyway. So, i said they were running and I ended up getting lost after a while. They were nowhere to be found! I didn't really panic because as an overthinker I've thought about to do if i get lost, so I ended up finding my way back in tears and calling my mom and Sasha's since i couldn't reach her.\n",
      "While i was starting to head home since i was very shaken up. As i was doing so, Dan and Sasha found me. I started explaining to them but i swear, no kidding, Sasha started laughing! Like full on belly laugher! I swear even Dan was uncomfortable! So yeah, she got confused why i got mad (Hm, i wonder why!) and we all ended up going to our houses. \n",
      "The next day after crying myself on the bed and my comfort movie i got a massage on Snapchat. It was two audio messages one minute each of them laughing at inside jokes. I've been cold towards Sasha ever since. And she says I'm still holding it over her head. We still talk but yeah. It's weird. And i also don't blame Dan because we got an opportunity to talk and he was shocked when i told him my reasonings of not wanting to go there in the first place so, yeah. That's it. So, beautiful people of the internet I leave it to your judgement, am i the aahole for being cold towards my friend?\n",

They were pissed, like visibly and audibly pissed when we told them what the plan was. They discussed it in private and made it out to be that we didn’t care about them (coming from the people who were actually invited to the small wedding). They took my husband out to dinner to “discuss” why we shouldn’t do it ending with MIL crying at the table while waiters and onlookers stared. It made my husband so uncomfortable. They argued that we weren’t thinking of anyone but ourselves (which, yes that’s what getting married is…?) and that everyone would be absolutely devastated.\n",

Idk I’m still just soooo not used to this behavior from grown adults. Makes me want to slam my face into a wall if I’m gonna be real. I understand the feelings this might elicit in people, but I definitely think you’re both right in that we need to just do what we think is best!  it’s not appropriate to manage other people’s feelings at the cost of what is best for our daughter”\n",

      " \n",
      "Ever since 2025 started, I've been feeling a shift in our relationship. We don't really talk anymore, we just respond to each other's messages. It takes way longer to have a conversation, and it's not really a conversation at all. I mentioned to her that I don't feel that important in her life, but she reassured me that I'm her \"bestest friend\" and that everyone else around her sucks. I tried to brush it off as just me being paranoid, but the feelings persisted. I understand that both her and I are busy with college and our personal life’s, but she’s simply not that busy, she’s just doesn’t want to be involved with me if it doesn’t necessarily benefits her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the same time, she told me she feels like she has executive dysfunction. As her best friend, I felt guilty about how “selfish” i’ve been for being upset that she’s barely talking to me, and I immediately jumped into helping her figure out ways to manage it. I even talked to people who suffered from the same thing, and someone suggested that picking up the same shows or hobbies might help us interact better. Because of that, I started watching her most liked show at the moment, Arcane. However, even after we started doing that, the same issues persisted, slow replies and a lack of interest. I assumed she was going through a tough time mentally, so I tried to be patient.\n",

In April, I saw that she was going out more, which wasn't necessarily a problem, but it seemed inconsistent with what she'd told me just a few weeks earlier, she didn't want to hang out because she didn't feel like going out. Then, my birthday came and she didn't even wish me a happy birthday. I’ve dealt with bad social anxiety for the past few years, because of that I forgot a lot of small details. I understand going through a rough time with mental health can make you forget more than usual, but If I felt like I might’ve forgotten her birthday, I would’ve wrote it down, or at least make an attempt to make sure I wouldn’t forget. Because of that, this was the final straw for me. I always feel like i’m making attempts to be an amazing friend to her, and she can’t even try to wish me a happy birthday? I stopped responding to her TikToks and text messages, I just didn't have the energy to want to talk to her.\n",

      "Body text: Yesterday I (20M) got in an argument with a classmate (24F) after asking to be given back a jacket that I lent her way back last year. This wasn’t the first time that I asked for it back, I’d wager it was in late November 2024. The recurrent theme in our arguments is that I had not actually “lent” this jacket, but rather that I had “gifted” it, and she has since repeated that there were witnesses that day that heard me say so. While I trust my memory, at this rate I’m willing to believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked for the jacket back the first time due to my struggles with money then, and since that jacket was quite expensive, I thought to sell it. This is when she first said she was “pretty confident” it was a gift. She empathised with me though, and said that once she went back to town where she left it, she would be giving it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flashforward, I’m still not that better off money-wise, but I asked for an update on the jacket, after I remembered how dear it was to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shift in her demeanor. She said she would be keeping it, that it was really rude to ask for a gift back, and that she wouldn’t allow me to “gaslight her again”. I was offended, and accused her of having bad manners. That I was asking back for it because it was something that mattered to me. I regretted being rude and tried to reel it back, settling for telling her that she could keep it, but that she shouldn’t judge me over this. She argued further, said it was awful manners to ask for a gift back, and that if it mattered so much, that I shouldn’t have gifted it. Ominously, she added she “was already judgmental of me for a long time”. I relied on my memory, insisting I hadn’t gifted it to her, only that I might’ve said I used it little. She repeated there were witnesses hearing me say I did, refused to speak to me further through text, and wished me good luck on our test that afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that day, I saw her outside talking to friends. I stood nearby for a while, hoping she’d approach me. I didn’t want to bring this up publicly. After twenty or so minutes, I left. I sent her another message, looking back on her strange text, and said quite bitterly that if she disliked me so much, that I would gladly help her get rid of the jacket. Getting this item back was now a matter of dignity, and about not allowing myself to be treated harshly. Going up the steps to my house, I saw a myriad of texts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you just stand there looking like an idiot?” “You are a gaslighter” “You have done awful things to both me and the people I love, and I don’t want someone like you near me” “You never look me in the eyes” “Your lack of care leaves a lot to wish for” “This jacket is my property, and now I’d rather burn it”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a meltdown then and there. I sent her some teary messages asking to be told about these things I had done that had hurt people. So far, no answer. I was too emotional, and assuming I gifted this item, I was wrong to do it without thinking it twice. This still feels rather unfair.\n",

      "Body text: I (19f) made a post for my boyfriend’s (18m) high school graduation on social media. It was a long sappy post about how proud I was of him for graduating even though he faced many challenges. I did not disclose that these issues were with his family and financial situation but I did mention in the post that he had to move twice during senior year (The first time when him and his dad were kicked out of his dad’s friend‘s house, the second when me and my boyfriend moved into our apartment.) I did not mention the reason for why he had to move, but that he while being in high school had to pay bills (he had to help his dad with bills bad gas sometimes, and then once they moved my boyfriend was responsible for the internet bill.) there were other things I included but essentially I talked about how he was a good example of succeeding despite challenges and about how he’s a great partner, you know all that sort of ramble.\n",

      "My boyfriend saw the post first and really liked it and told me it was very sweet so I didn’t think anything of it.

I asked my boyfriend if he wanted me to delete the post but he said no because he said he liked it and that it came from the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really conflicted because my boyfriend’s dad has messaged him about being upset about the post. His dad is also upset because he thinks my boyfriend‘s mom will use the post against him. My boyfriend‘s parents are divorced and due to his mom having more kids than she can care for financially and having a bad living situation, he moved in with his dad once he became sober. My boyfriends dad has never really bought groceries so my boyfriend has always bought them for himself and when his mom knew she turned it into an argument, and other situations like that have happened before. I think my boyfriends dad is worried she won’t let him see my boyfriends younger brother (he has many but only 1 is his dad’s) My boyfriend told his dad that he took the post in the wrong way and that if his mom texts his dad to tell him and he’ll handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my mind I feel like I’m not in the wrong because I didn’t mention his dad at all and it wasn’t meant be slander. Yes, my boyfriend had to help with bills and such as a minor due to his dads poor decisions, criminal record and no college degree leading him to struggle to find a good paying job but I didn’t mention any of that only that my boyfriend had bigger financial responsibilities as a high schooler than most and it had a very large mental impact on him and made his life harder yet he still did his best. On the other hand  I don’t want to cause him trouble with his ex wife and seeing his other child. Me and his dad have always got along great, and I feel really bad I’ve upset him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Edit: Here are some pieces of info I forgot to add, might help with context a bit since I’ve had a few people ask for clarification. His dad was a very well known drug addict and drug dealer in our county. He went to prison and now is not in prison but the charges prevent him from a lot. He has no custody if his kids and there’s no custody battle occurring. nothing legal. when my boyfriend moved in with him he told his mom to drop the child support so there’s none of that, definitely would not say anything publicly if there was legal stuff involved. little update as well: boyfriend texted his dad to explain and things seem to be worked out after my boyfriend explained he may have misinterpreted and taken it personally. I asked my boyfriend if I should tweak or delete but he insisted he likes it as it is, however if his dad requests that I do I’ll oblige since even changing the wording would still keep the same message.\n",

He meant that since I was the divorce kid, people would gossip. But, he caught himself and said that people would be conversing about death which would not be okay for me. So, I let it go. However, I said I want to see my grandmother because I had lost a grandparent without meeting them recently. He said that I can meet her in a time when she is not stressed. I did not find it suspicious, however the most important ceremony regarding my grandfather's death took place yesterday, after which my father asked if I wanted to visit.

      "I (19f) have worked at my job for 3 years. Two years ago, two girls were hired. \"Cara\" (19f) and \"Nadia\" (21f). At first everything was cool. We all got along. That is, until my managers got into a bad habit of boasting about me and my work. \n",

Now, I'm a hard worker and I try my best but I don't think this was anywhere near necessary especially because it felt like they were using me to insult/compare me to my coworkers. \n",
      "I think this is where the problem started. Cara and Nadia would get mad when the managers would compliment me, ice me out, talk about me behind my back, and make fun of me when I was in earshot. It got to a point where I dreaded going to work everyday. I would have panic attacks in my car before walking in, and I would regularly have to take a break because it was too much. \n",

He said i should stop holding a grudge and how immature it is to hold a grudge like a middle schooler. But I don't think its that simple? I'm still really uncomfortable and to be honest, I didnt think she would come back, and her being back has brought up all that insecurity and anxiety that i felt last year. I don't think i can forgive her, she and Nadia made my life hell for a year. AITA?\n",

I’ve only met her once, but I spent pretty much the whole day with her and Joe (from 11am to 10pm) so I can confidently assert that she and I have nothing in common other than Joe. Trying to have a conversation was difficult because we don’t even like the same books, or movies, or music, and I didn’t feel engaged in our conversations - I considered leaving early at one point because I just wasn’t that interested in hanging out any longer. She is really nice and really smart, but I don’t see myself ever developing a friendship with her and I would rather spend my time on relationships that are more worthwhile to me.\n",
      "\n",

I’m hosting a small get-together for close friends (max 5 people) at my apartment this weekend, and he invited her to my home without telling me — I found out today, and he said that he can’t take the invitation back because it will really upset her and hurt her feelings if she’s uninvited. I feel like maybe I’m overreacting by being so mad about this, because it makes sense that she would want to get to know me better — and especially because we’re both women, my not wanting to hang out with her feels catty. I don’t want her to think I’m being a pick-me or a possessive ‘girl best friend,’ and I worry that’s how I’m behaving. \n",

      "However, I also feel that I have a right to know who I’ll be spending time with before I agree to a plan, because I should be allowed to walk away from events and situations where people I don’t feel like spending time with are there — and I certainly have a right to say who comes in my home and who doesn’t. I also feel that it’s wrong of Joe to put me in a position of looking like a villain for saying ‘no.’ So reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to hang out with my friend’s girlfriend because I don't want to be her friend?\n",

My brother had a girlfriend in this group (16F) who I will refer to as Jay. They got together as the group was starting to form, only a month in, and only recently broke up after being together for 4 months. They ended on good terms, however I didn’t know my brother doesn’t want to be around her anymore. We planned a trip, where we would all go to our parents’ condo a 3 hour drive away and our parents agreed to it as well as everybody in the group’s parents. I got to meet Jay throughout the 6 months of this friend group and knew her a bit before through my brother and we’ve gotten to the point of us considering each other best friends. When they broke up I didn’t think my brother would expect of me to cut off contact with her as he didn’t either, but recently he’s been making remarks on how I keep ‘talking to his ex’ and when I brought up the trip he said ‘it’s still happening, just not without her’. An important detail is that Jay is moving away after the summer and won’t be here, and she considers me her closest friend and I don’t think the whole group going on a trip and excluding her, including her best friend, would be a good last memory to have of your home before moving and I don’t think it would be fair either. I told him that’s it better to not have the trip at all then and wait another year if he doesn’t want her there but he’s saying I’m choosing her side when it’s ‘his’ house and we had a verbal argument about this:\n",

      "From my perspective: It’s my house too and it’s a group thing we planned beforehand. I would’ve cut her off if she was doing something wrong to him or being an asshole but from what I got the whole reason they broke up was because he wasn’t attracted to her anymore and it just became really toxic from there and they were better off as friends. I didn’t know that me being around her bothered him but in my eyes I don’t think it’s fair to exclude her just because he doesn’t like her anymore and the group is big enough to the point where they don’t have to directly talk to each other in the span of a week.\n",

      "Body text: So my mom (53f) has planned for us to go on a big horse trip that starts with us going tomorrow on a 6 hour car ride to the place and then the day after starts 4 days of riding and then we'll come home again on sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one really wants to go on that horse trip except for mom, my dad (52m) broke a collarbone recently and my gf (21f) broke a rib recently too, neither of them can ride because of it so they would just be staying at the place we'll be sleeping at and then join everybody for the dinner and chat afterwards. My brother (25m) has barely gotten any vacation for 1½ years now and finally has a week vacation and really just wants to use it to relax and not do much, I (19m) don't really want to go because i just came back from another trip and i'll start working a lot soon and i want to use that time to spend time with my girlfriend or just relax. \n",
      "\n",
      "My dad and my girlfriend both like being very active so this sounds awful for both of them but they cant say it to mom because she'll become sad and most likely very annoyed. My mom also recently got very frustrated with my girlfriend, first there was the time my dad fell off a horse and broke his collarbone and my mom got frustrated at my girlfriend when she was trying to be safe and make sure the horses that were very spooked now wouldnt hurt anyone else, she even went as far as saying that no one would like her on the horse trip because of how she was acting, the second time was when my girlfriend fell off and broke a rib and we where trying to figure out what to do and see if insurance would cover it (she comes from abroad) but my mom claimed that she knew everything about how this was done and got really frustrated at me and my girlfriend for wanting to do this our way and talk to my girlfriends mom who has worked as a nurse for 20+ years about what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two friends of the family were also supposed to join for the ride but sadly their son got very sick and now they cant join.\n",
      "\n",
      "So currently my mom wants us to go on this trip, 5 people where only 3 can ride and only 1 really wants to go but no one wants to say anything because she has paid for it and got a horse trailer loaned from a friend and made everything ready and if me and my girlfriend decide not to go im scared that i'll ruin the whole trip for mom and get her really mad at my girlfriend because she will definitely think the only reason i dont want to go is because my girlfriend doesnt want to go when the only reason i ever wanted to go on that trip in the first place was because i wanted to take my girlfriend there, btw this is a yearly trip we make so its not even a once in a lifetime thing\n",
      "\n",
      "So, wibta if i told my mom me and my girlfriend wouldnt want to go on this trip?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit to clarify: My mom payed for the trip before my gf and my dad got hurt, everyone wanted to go on the trip (except  maybe my brother) then but then people got hurt and now people dont rwally want to go anymore\n",

He also went to say that he follows me around like a puppy and that also made me upset. My bf is very quiet so he didnt say anything and I didnt feel embarrassed but the way he announced it out loud in front of everyone and then for the rest of the friend group to agree made me feel some type of way. Mind you im the only one in a relationship and i feel like they have no say on what i do with my boyfriend.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recently I noticed- very quickly- that he always tries to be very close to me. We hang out in a group setting most of the time, but everyone gets to talk with everyone. Not with him. He always wants to be in my vicinity, which at first didn’t really bother me, because I didn’t notice, but it got to a point where I was uncomfortable. I would feel his presence, and I like my personal space, and he was always in it. \n",

      "Then he started “subtly” asking me out. Not asking me to be his girlfriend, but things like this: If I mentioned a restaurant or place I wanted to see, he would immediately suggest for us two to go there. Just us two. I wasn’t comfortable with just us two being alone so I would always respond with suggesting to plan a day with the group. \n",

      "After that, it seems he didn’t get the message, and he is still as insistent. He even texts my brother about the possibility of dating me in the future.

I’ve started further distancing myself: ignoring messages, not attending gatherings or meetups where he would be, etc.\n",

It's totally friendly and comforting for both of us. I’m a bit taller/bigger than him, and he always says he feels really safe when I hold him (his cute little self), and honestly I love it too. It's just our thing and it makes us feel close.\n",

      "Recently he got a new cologne and started wearing it a lot. The scent is really strong, and whenever we cuddle, it feels like it's directly in my face. It makes my nose itch and sometimes I feel like sneezing. It’s just overwhelming for me overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, I finally said something. I basically told him to stop wearing cologne because it was too much for me. He looked kind of surprised and said he didn’t even notice it was bothering me. But I realized later that I probably sounded a little harsh and didn’t explain myself well. What I *meant* was that I’d really prefer if he didn’t wear it when we’re spending close time together, especially cuddling. I’m not trying to control him or say he can’t wear it at all, I just can’t be around that strong scent up close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I feel like I might have come off as an AH. I don’t want to make him feel bad or self-conscious about something he’s excited about (he was really proud of this cologne).

Now, the only nights I can be consistently home is Monday(only i have off), Wednesday (both off all day) and Friday(she is off all day, i just have my night job around 7). There are the occasional Sundays I have a shift at my night job but mostly I try to reserve it for my dnd group. My gf is currently mad at me for \"always being out\" and wants me to refuse to play dnd at night when everyone is available so I can have another day to spend the night at home with her. I've invited her to come sit at the table and she's met most of these friends and always talks about how much she likes them. But she refuses to come spend time there. Every other night of the week that I have off we hang out, watch YouTube, cook dinner and whatnot together. I'm truly grateful for the time we spend together; I love her very much. I especially enjoy getting to wake up together on Wednesday and Friday and our parallel play on Wednesday. I just am wondering if I'm not giving her enough of my time? AITA for wanting to go play with them one night a week? Im just really confused and sad about it. She gets angrier and angrier about it each week. Please help. 🙏🏾 \n",

      " so I am a 14 year old guy. This all started about 3 hours ago my friends were over and we were talking. Suddenly my sister calls them over and say \"you wana see his old pics\" I knew this wasn't going to end well. Because she has some embarrassing pictures of me when I was 4 to 5. I told her not to show those pictures to them but she laughed and said it was harmless. My sister then confused to show them some embarrassing pictures of me when I was a kid then a cringe video of me dancing (  I dodent wana do it ) . It was tolerable until she showed a video of me when I was 7 with a filter on forming me to kiss her on the check. (My friends were laughing at me) I then tried to snatch her phone but she didn't let me. Then she says \"wana see more\" I yelled at her to stop but she then pulled out 2 pictures of me when I was in my underwear when I was 5 the she showed it to my friends they burst into laughter, I kept my cool until my freinds left they did show pictures of them self's ( regular picture one of my freind with his mom he was fully clothed and the other of my friends face when he was young) after they left i yelled at her and berated her ( note i have telling her for years to delete those pictures and she had told me that she delete them ) she laughed and said \" they are your friends they won't make fun of you like he'll they won't they are 14). When I told her to delete those pictures she said \"no these are HARMELESS memories\" to which I replied \" no they aren't\" they my mom started yelling at me and my sister not to delete those pictures saying \"they are just harmless memories\" then they started to gaslit me for being too dramatic and over reacting then I lost my cool and threw my sister's watch on the wall and threw some bags. I then cried in my room for an hour, my sister came up to me acting all fine and when I called her out she started acting as it was my fault. My mom still thinks I am over relacting and tries to gaslight me. My dad doesn't know yet and Idk his reaction, what I am most concerned about is that my friends will tell all my other friends and people in my school. \n",
      "This isent the first time they have done this my sister has \"jokingly\" showed these pics to my freind when I was maby 8 to 10. My other concern is how lightly they showed these pictures to my friends. Maby they have shown these pictures to other people too. Note my friends weren't even asking for the pictures we were talking about something totally unrelated my sister willingly and openly showed these pictures to my friends also this isent like a innocent mistake she is TWENTY FOUR.\n",

I helped them pack up their old place, which is owned by the wife's parents (kinda relevant). A group of us got everything moved over to the new place in a day using a big box truck. The old place has a smart lock with pin code entry. At the time, I was moving my stuff out of my old place into a storage unit while at the same time locking in a new place. I more or less was homeless for a little less than a week, but it was moderately ok cause I work nights, so sleeping in my car during the day wasn't terrible. So back to the story: I needed a place that night to sleep and their old house was vacant. Since I didn't have keys for my new place I was closing on yet, I unlocked my friends' old place without their knowledge and slept on the floor for the night. I overslept and the cleaning crew they hired came to get the old place cleaned up and found me on the floor which got back to my friends.\n",
      "Obviously not cool at all for me to have done that. Definitely the A*hole. But now they haven't called or texted in over a month.

I also know I have a laissez-faire, nonchalant attitude towards personal belongings: I give freely anything and everything, but I also may take more than I should.  \n",
      "I immediately apologized and tried meeting with them, but they essentially refused to meet. I also told them I had no problem in talking to their parents, who I have met before about it, but they said that wasn't necessary either. After getting the justified cold shoulder, I just thought I would wait for them to reach out, but it's been over a month now.\n",

She said in front of my parents “he doesn’t know how to behave, doesn’t listen to anything, person we met irritated, it’s my car my choice if I want windows down or AC” and like I said pretty useless fake accusations because she can’t adjust or compromise even a little bit.

      "Body text: There is this group of people who are friends.  I've known one couple for 20+years.  One of my kids has been very good friends with one of theirs for many years.  The other couple i've know for maybe 4 years.  Nice people.  For the last year or so I've noticed the one husband (Call him Bob) and the other wife (call her Kim) have developed a friendship.  We belong to the same golf club and I'd often see them hanging out together in the bar area (where you'd go after a round of golf or whatever, casual).  I found it strange for Bob because he's kind of a \"guy's guy\", tends to hang with men etc.  It got to a point where their hanging out together became remarkable in the sense that it was so out of character for Bob, and Kim(10 years his junior, not that it matters) seemed very friendly toward him.  You'd have to be blind to not see they are very fond of each other.  And people would talk but I'd just stay out of it.  I kept my mouth shut but had some concerns.

The restuarant was pretty busy and the bar area behind the hotess desk was packed.  Thru the crowd I see Kim sitting at the bar.  Im going to be seated at the table and tell the hotess to wait a sec - i was going to say hello to Kim.  Through the crowd I see that she is with Bob.  And there spouses are not there.  I feel like an intruder so decide to just go to my table.  When my husband joins me I mention it to him and say \"am I weird in thinking this is off?\"  I keep trying to rationalize it - maybe they each stopped in for a drink and ran into each other, maybe they were each picking up takeout.  They leave at the same time about 90 minutes later.  I'll admit I'm baffled and shaken.  I care for both of these people.\n",

I ended up transferring schools due to having low credits, and I met this guy named \"S\"(18M) after a couple of months. We got close pretty fast, and one day I finally told \"M\" about \"S\", and they got super mad that I had never introduced them. They ended up not talking to me for a week. We always got in petty fights and most of the time it was them getting mad at me over for example, wanting to go to chili's over applebees (yes an actual reason they got mad at me).\n",

After about 7 months that \"S\" and \"M\" were dating, \"M\" came to me AGAIN for advice on how to breakup with \"S\" because \"he was too poor for them to date\" EXACT QUOTES.. And i understand wanting to go on dates BUT HE DID TAKE \"M\" ON DATES. just not dinner dates and spending lots of money. He would take them on hikes, picnics, go up into the canyons, lakes. After the whole conversation I told them straight up \"im not gonna choose between you guys if you stop being friends with \"S\".\" they once again got upset with me.

They didn’t want to stay after that and she’s gone driving with them but she reckons I was out of line and her friends should be allowed to come and have a drink if they want to.\n",

      "I find one of these guys incredibly annoying and I hate it when’s he here because he just won’t shut up. Even when I’m wearing headphones (sometimes even my Bluetooth earmuffs to really make a point) he’ll just keep asking me inane questions, not listen to the answers, and carry on with an entirely one sided conversation. It is fair to say that I would rather he didn’t come round and my cousin is very aware of that so she didn’t tell me he was coming. It’s very possible that I would have ignored our rule for someone else.\n",

I asked him to leave but he said that my cousin had said he could stay. Eventually he left but this is a rural area, he’d biked here, and I was freaked out. So I told her that I’d rather she didn’t have people over because I don’t want these sort of people knowing where our house is.\n",

So yeah… let’s go with no more alcohol allowed in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway I might be being a bit controlling and a bit of an AH because I unilaterally decided to make it alcohol free a couple of months ago. I reasoned that I was the only one buying it so I would just stop and if I wanted a drink I would have to go out. Every other person she’s had here has been fine with it and she hasn’t kicked up a stink before now but she has occasionally brought drinks home with her and I’ve made her get rid of them. She got upset with me once and wrecked a 3000pc puzzle I was working on but it might have been less about the drinks and more about me not letting her have my car keys.\n",

      "I might also be being an AH because she won’t pay for power and leaving the lights on all night and won’t get firewood in so I’m refusing to light the fire when she’s home and turning the light fuses off when I go to bed. I realise that there is a lot that makes her an AH but this sort of petty stuff that I’m doing might mean that I’m also an AH? Also an awful lot of the stuff she’s doing is related to her poor mental health so my behaviour might not be super helpful?\n",

The idea was for me to stay the whole time, and then help set up for his bday and go home with my parents on the last day, but I drove my own car so technically I can leave whenever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip has been sorta strained the whole time tho with my birthmom and her husband constantly arguing, and the baby crying alllll the time and getting on my nerves. They also act like I'm not there and only interact with the baby, only talking to me to tell me to do the dishes or grab something. I've been here on the trip 3 days now but I'm getting sort of to my limit as I've always struggled with autism/ocd personality and stuff like that. \n",

I didn't know until today, and when I found out I told them that I was uncomfortable with strangers being in the house with me alone. I told my birthmom it was bc id had issues with construction workers being creepy while I was in my house alone in the past, and that i wasn't comfortable with it even if it's just a babysitter, and she said I was being weird about the issue.\n",

I asked where the cameras were and he refused to tell me, implying theyd be watching me, and also said the babysitter knows about the cameras after shed found them. I told them that was hella weirding me out, and they said I was being a weirdo and overreacting and that I needed to chill out. \n",

      "Idk, I feel like I need to leave but would I be the asshole?

I have two uncles both are abroad with their families my father was also abroad but came back since no one was there to take care of my grandparents . My grandpa passed away when I was 7 and grandma passed away when I was 16 . I was basically the family therapist or idk what to call myself , the responsible one and somehow the bad one aswell?\n",
      "\n",
      "I live in a very traditional family , this inviting guests , guests coming over or us going to someone's house is a very frequent thing . Ever since I was in 3rd grade , I was left at home to care for my baby brother (1 at the time) and disabled grandma . Ngl I was also the one to blame since at one point my mom got very sick and her legs used to hurt a lot , thus when I was in 1st grade she used to vent her anger on me , sometimes beat me for not doing the household chores— since her friend's daughter is my age aswell and she does all the housework— I of course thought it was my fault since my dad also told me I don't do any work .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was always expected to be the topper , the second position was the bare 'minimum' and I would get a lecturing if I got a 3rd place . And my teachers doing favouritism and getting the students whom they tutor the top spot didn't help . My father would always go to my teachers complaining and my teachers (as immature as they were) gave me ONLY ME extra work .... \n",
      "\n",
      "From 3rd to 10th grade I was the caretaker of my siblings and grandma.My grandma loved me but would always say bad stuff about my mom— I love my mom ! I had a strained relationship with her because of that . And my father wouldn't like it when I stood up to my grandma to defend my mom and my father would scold me . \n",
      "\n",
      "I gained a little weight in a trip to Afghanistan , now I'm 57kg and my family kept saying I'm fat (I know I'm ) but one day my mother got angry and called me a fat bull yelling at me...it's stuck in my mind , I hated that , I tried doing diet but my mom again gaslighted me saying I shouldn't 'starve myself' . She always yelled and scolded me whenever I got second or third then reprimanded me for being too hard on myself during studies . She stopped making me breakfast when I was in 3rd grade then kept mocking me when I grew up for not making breakfast for myself (I dun have the habit , I always went to school hungry even now ) and multiple more occasions where she kept comparing me to her friend's house or other relatives ...\n",
      "\n",
      "So just now my mom is going out somewhere important and told me if her friend came over I should tell her that I forgot to tell my mom that she was coming . I told her no , I said she has always embarrassed be Infront of several other relatives with the same lie and now I am an adult — I have dignity ! Since she refused to admit that teens have dignities (or in general just me ) I told her to just text her friend to come tomorrow , she will understand as they are very close . My mom called me son of a bitch and yelled at me then called her friend ... So am I the a**hole .? \n",
      "\n",
      "U guys can stop till the above paragraph as I need venting and I'm too drained to go to another sub reddit to vent further . My siblings — I have been changing their diapers , feeding them formula and stuff I practically raised them , I love them but ! It seems unfair , my mother would get up every morning to get them ready for school , give them full breakfast and prepare homemade lunch . I never had a proper breakfast unless it's weekend and my mom would make for me too since im also there (she would pour tea for everyone but me ) I have always wanted to have homemade lunch since all my friends would have it , but noooo all I got was 20 rupees (other girls had 100 ) and that money was from my grandma not mom . You all may think I'm lying but I'm crying recalling those memories . Was I simply not worth waking up early and preparing breakfast for ? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When u bring the last up I instantly shut up as my mom would tell me I'm gaslighting her and that she was also suffering . I GET IT! my mom married young , my father coming back from abroad didn't help , since my mother and us are now forever stuck in this Underdeveloped country with horrible security while my aunts and uncles are now having a great life with security . \n",
      "\n",
      "My mom does love me I know , I was and am  simply the only she can and could vent her anger on . My dad loves me too infact he's the one who shows it , but he never took my side , always my mom's . \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I now think that I'm crazy , am I ? Since whenever I try to vent to my mom she tells me I'm a psycho and in a very convincing way....I dunno what to do , I'm scared like not exaggerating but SCARED if getting second or third , I recently gave my board exams , and I wish to be the topper of my class or just fail . \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though my mom's been a little less mean and more affectionate since I've turned 18 ..... If you've read this far , I thank u , no one ever listens to me without telling me it's my fault or I'm overreacting.\n",

      "My family and I (17M) have moved to another country for my Moms heart transplant operation that was refused to be done in our home country. And for 1 and a little bit years we have been living here. I am a student, and am coming up to the important part of my schooling that decides what mark I get to go to university.

      "\n",
      "After the operation my parents are happy to send me home with my Dad because my Mom doesn't need around the clock care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the nature of a transplant there is no date that the operation can be scheduled, as a heart of right size, blood type, etc.. needs to be available, so there is no plan to send me back. My parents don't want to send me back alone because \"I can't care for myself\" which I don't think is true (but I'm a little biased), nor is there family back home that can take care of me .\n",

      "I have been asking them to send me back alone to no avail. And I'm sort of feeling like the AH for burdening them with more stress on top of the surgery.

      "Body text: hello, i have lived for 4 girls this past year and where we live housing is really hard to come by. We have been trying to find a house since January for a June move in, but every house wanted us to move in asap and our lease at our current house is not up till June 15th. 2 girls have dropped out of our housing search for this upcoming year and I have a old college roomie that I am bestfriends that decided to join me and one of my roomates lets call her Cari. Cari and I are friends and while we have been searching for places cari has been pretty picky on some homes we have looked for. We found a great house that would be about the same rent, but Cari said the kitchen colors were ugly and the landlord was not too happy they said that. There has been some scenarios similar and i totally understand we want to find a great house for the expense.\n",

      " I have a coworker who I have always thought was so sweet and she has an opening in her awesome house for the same price as I am paying now. I do love Cari, however I am much closer to my old college roommate. We went to look at a place for 3 today and its almost $400 more a month than my coworkers place and this new one has no parking with smaller rooms. I already spend half of my months salary on rent so thinkng about cutting into my savings/spending money hurts my soul. I really hate the idea of leaving cari to fend for herself and do not know how to tell her i just dont see how i can afford this much more. I have mentioned to cari that we should start looking at single rooms and she said she would rather pay more to live with us as she does not want to live with strangers. It is pretty easy to find single rooms where we live, but has been more challenging to find a home. It is just so close to us having to move out and im scared I wont find a place, but also scared of being so terrible to even think about doing this\n",

We met over the weekend and talked about it again..this time though he said that one of his friends wanted to go for drinks with him but he was okay tagging me along. Yesterday however..the said friend initiated plans with the whole friend group and they're to meet up for drinks and dinner on the Saturday before his birthday. I feel overlooked seeing as we'd agreed well spend the weekend together way before they made their plans.He now wants to split the time...Saturday for them Sunday for me..this is not the first time our plans have been adjusted by him to accommodate plans made by his friends after he'd committed to plans with me. On a few occasions  when we've had to split time..the friends ended up coming up with new plans and he agreed to them without communication to me and never showed up for plans with me at the time he promised to come to me and now I'm afraid if he goes out with them Saturday night they'll convince him to spend majority of Sunday with them and I won't have any time with my boyfriend on his birthday. So AITA for expecting him to reschedule plans with them?\n",

He usually ignores my messages for hours daily, comes online and answers to others but still not to me. Now he doesn't even come online anymore because of my yapping about him changing. 8th of March was woman's day in my country. I got nothing from him, not even a flower. (it's a tradition that close men in your life buy you flowers) Mind you a rose is like 2$ in my country. We were betting about something few times and he lost and he promised to give me his hoodie and a necklace. He didn't do it despite me telling him for weeks how much it means to me. Plus I'm wearing necklace that my ex gave me and he is yapping about it but never got me another one to wear. He said all of his hoodies mean too much to him and they hold memories. And I'm like okay, go to second hand, buy one(its like 5$), wear it and put your perfume on it. About necklaces I'm not asking for anything expensive. Stainless steel ones cost like 4$. He knows all of this and despite it all I still haven't gotten anything. He has a good salary and it's not like he can't afford it. And when we go out he pays mostly because his salary is way bigger than mine. I pay like 40% of the time and he 60%.His bday is this week on Sunday and I planned to take him to massage, bake him a cake, plus buy a bunch of presents that I know he will like. All of it would cost me 100$-150$. People around me told me to not do it. I plan on not buying him anything in the end. So WIBTA if I don't buy him anything and how should I react to it? \n",

I got upset and text her that if she would come to my side of town it would make it a little easier for me. Since then the only text I've gotten from her was a link to a pair of shoes. It's now been almost a week since we've actually talked. I feel that since I sent her the last actual message with an actual request in it that I shouldn't have to reach out again, I am kinda waiting for her to respond to my request anyway. \n",

Part of me knows that I’m going to hate it and it’s going to be apparent and if they try and ride a roller coaster and I have to get on too, I will simply not let them get on because I REFUSE to ride roller coasters since I have a fear of them. But another part of me is saying either I suffer for a day or feel guilty for not taking them forever. It’s just one day and it might be nice but I’m not sure. WIBTA?\n",

So I would of course do it for them to make it easier for them. I'm a bigger guy that goes to the gym so lifting/carrying heavy things are nothing to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "So by reflex I grabbed the bag from her to do it myself and as soon as I did it, she immediately said in a sarcastic and annoyed tone \"Oh that's cute, you don't think I can lift it up  and do it myself. It's fine I can do it\". I didn't take it personally I just said \"ok that's fine\" also again I just started, I don't want a problem with anyone.\n",

      "\"Why did you try to help me with the garbage beforehand? Did you think I can't do it? Do you think it's right to treat women that way? To grab the bag away from them like they're not able to do it?\" I explained to her very calmly absolutely not I respect women and I didn't mean to offend her. Then she says \"All day and last time we were on shift that you were constantly telling me how to do my job and explaining to me how to do stuff and repeating things back to me when I've been working here longer then you have\". Again I told her I would never intentionally disrespect her and I apologized and she said don't do it again. Then we left and I clocked out for my shift.\n",

Again I would never ever be hateful towards women. \n",

When I told my dad that he told me that I should be quiet and be grateful that i didn't have to go into debt or work in order to get through college. Even though with grandma rose being there im sure she will not let me have the gift I actually need (she wants me to get a regular computer for \"hunting for jobs\" but the only real difference between a gaming computer and a regular computer in this case is that a regular computer will just help me find jobs not help with playing with friends which is something I also need given my severe lack of a social life). \n",

While we were close, sometimes i would talk to her about some things that confused or frustrated me about another friend, Y. These were not huge betrayals or deep personal issues, just small things that highlighted how different Y and I were in personality or preferences. we are very different in terms of our outlook on life, upbringing (religious vs not). This became more apparent especially when we travelled together and the trip made me see these differences and also made me feel the frustrations more as I wasn’t able to see her perspective (in theory i understand everyone is different but in practice i struggle to empathise - does this make sense) \n",

I didn’t say anything with malicious intent, and I see it as something people do to process their feelings or get perspective. At least for me, even with X no longer being my best friend, I would probably find another friend whom I can relate to on a close enough level to vent and discuss. (ENTP here, if that matters) I do acknowledge that I need to work on being less judgmental and critical but Im not sorry for “talking behind her back” because i needed that space to sound out my thoughts… On the other hand, I also get how hurtful it is to hear those things, especially secondhand.\n",

Yes this is where i could be the asshole but I decided after the biggest anxiety attack, I’ve had enough and I quit, even tho we pay $1425 in rent every month.

Here’s the problem, my boyfriend got really upset I quit (which is understandable) and thinks he’s gonna have to pay all these bills alone. I ended up texting my boss sort of apologizing for this morning and to give me a couple days to see if I want to come back. She said that is completely fine and that she’ll be waiting for my answer. Even knowing that no matter what I have a job secured he is still being really mean and doesn’t think I’m gonna get either job. I feel like it’s making me think I made a bad decision and that I have no way to get these jobs. I’m so mentally beat down and unfortunately if it ends up I don’t get these jobs I still have a job to go to. I’ve asked him many times to just have faith in me and he doesn’t respond. It’s also incredibly hypocritical cause he’s done that 2 times to me so that’s what upsets me even more. I know he loves me and wants the best for both of us but I just feel like he doesn’t have any faith in me. So am I the asshole for quitting my miserable job this morning.\n",

So then I started getting desperate in the last couple of weeks after things escalated and it started causing issues for my other friend. I reached out begging him to contact me to which he ignored me. The worst part was when he lied to me saying he had 'plans' when I ask for a ride home from school. (He usually gives me rides home). And ever since then he has been ignoring me, I've been messaging him but it doesn't matter, he won't do anything. I'm at the point where I don't even know what to do. I mean is it even worth being friends with him? The biggest kicker is the fact that he doesn't even know why he is being a jerk. I feel like I lost him as a friend and I want him back. \n",

Now I get if the questions were kind of rude but i meant it in an honest manner and that's what I always told her.

And I do understand that she doesn't have much empathy given the situations where she yells at my dad for visiting his family (because my mom thinks that my aunties from fathers side, are hating on her, because our aunts just never asked my mom to hang with them, considering that my mom always shuts the invitations down even if she got invited. Now my aunts have stopped to ask my mom because whats the point if my mom always shuts it down.) and my mom is also kind of crazy and a hypocrite when it comes to problems she caused she always blames others and when she does get really emotional she just threathens us by saying she will harm herself and so on... So that just describes her lack of empathy and while I have an upcoming highlight concert this year, my mom announced that she will come and see it and i fear that she might do something she did last week at my choir concert.(which is coming up to stage after we directly finished our last song and while people were still applauding, she screamed my name and told me to put on my jacket.

      "Body text: My Mother(36f) and I(14F) have always had a rather complicated relationship, we've always clashed and disagreed on many things, especially since I'm really stubborn and my  Mother doesn't take back talk from any of her kids(especially from me). This morning while we were getting food at Wendy's my mother and brother(19M) were talking about something that eventually transpired into her saying that she knows if she keeps talking about the topic, me and my siblings will call her chismosa which means a woman who likes to gossip. I then agreed and said that she is a chismosa and i do admit i was wrong in calling her that but i was not necessarily wrong, anyway my mother got upset at me and went on a lecture about how i could call her that and that I don't know how it feels like to be called that by her own 2 children, which was me(14f) and my brother(19m). after that we kinda stopped but i for some reason felt the ridiculous reason to add \"That's why she's like that.\" which was a comment about my youngest sister(11f) being a bit of a gossiper because shes a mini version of my mother, my mother then told me to shut up which was justified and we ended it off there. She did start crying quietly and made some more remarks about how she isn't going to forget what i said and about how it hurts her that her children see her as a Chismosa. i do feel bad and i do see how i am wrong but I don't think there's anything i can do about this because my mother does hold grudges and usually in my family there is no apologies/apologizing after an argument/fight. Emotions are definitely not talked about in my family much since my parents are both emotionally distant and absent so i really don't think saying \"I'm sorry\" is going to fix anything.\n",

      "I (24F) used to do pole dancing as a way to get fit in the past, but stopped due to insecurity. I know it's petty, but I was raised in a competitive environment and being surrounded by beautiful and overall wonderful girls all around irl and on social media while I kept failing over and over really did a number on my mental state at the time. \n",

      "Either way, not too long ago I decided to pick it up again, as I really like this activity when I am not stuck in my head. My bf (25M) was supportive of that, he goes to the gym every week and was happy when I found new motivation to be active. He offered to be there during my training to keep my mind off bad thoughts and so we could have fun together (maybe he also just wanted to look at me pole dancing, idk). Anyway, there I was, warming up, trying to remember my tricks and it was going pretty good. Then I got this idea to try a tougher trick, but slipped and slid down, not exactly gracefully, and my bf let out a laugh at that. Usually, I can laugh at myself, but I felt very culnerable in the moment, both because I had a long break and because I am not used to being watched, especially by someone I want to be interested in me, and it just felt like he was laughing at me. I asked him to stop, but he said that I looked very funny, and my insecurities just rushed right back to me, so I ended the practice session and don't feel like talking to him much after that.\n",

      "I know it's silly, that it likely was involuntary, but still, I couldn't laugh at myself in the moment like I can with most hobbies. He did apologize and even offered to try it himself, but I don't want him to hurt himself, as it isn't exactly a move you can get into without some preparation and training prior. I pretty much stopped talking to him after that. In part I'm upset at him, but I also feel like he sees me as this awkward pig who can't do anything athletic. It doesn't help that he sometimes watches athletic girls on Instagram, too. \n",

While we were still in uni, he worked during the 3rd and 4th semesters, but he quit because his boss was terrible. Since then, he's been helping out a lot at his parents' house (we both still live with our parents).

I don’t want to break up with him because he’s a genuinely good person, but I’m struggling to get through to him.

We had played for a couple hours until he got off briefly for a to go hit up a nearby brewery w an irl friend. We boot up a few hours later with another mutual friend and on our third game together towards the end of the match (I had already died & wasn't spectating) he starts ridiculing the mutual friend decision that resulted in his death. I interjected and defended the mutual friend made was actually the right play due to a game mechanic that they weren't aware of. At that point he tells the rest of the squad that \"you can have fun with him\" and abruptly leaves. I didn't think much of it because he's rage quit before for much less. But then I look at my phone to a massive paragraph text where he stated that he was just joking and that I often times have an attitude problem and think I'm above everyone that we play with because I'm a \"little bit better at the video game\".\n",

Okay so you must know I am a 4.0 GPA student and I hate being tardy because my mom doesn’t like it and I don’t want to get in trouble by the school for my tardiness because they have like step 1, 2 and so on, which is just the levels you go on for tardiness which have worse consequences the higher step you are on. Anyways that’s always been the type of person I am but Kaylee doesn’t really care about that like I do, so she’s very okay with being late and not being in class when you’re supposed to. She walks me to a few of my classes (her choice, I couldn’t care less if she doesn’t or not and she knows this) but it seems like every time I need to get to class she always is like “wait I need to tell you something, it’s important” and I’m very iffy about it and I’ll tell her something like “I really can’t be late. Just tell me after class or during lunch” and she’s very insistent on it. It always makes me feel like a bad friend because I leave her even though she seems very urgent and in need to talk, which is not the problem, I will always listen when she needs someone to talk to but it’s just her timing that isn’t my favorite. But today we were in the cafeteria waiting for school to start and we are sitting there pretty quiet not talking much. Then the bell rings so we start walking to class because our classes are on the same path but as soon as we get to my class she starts talking about her mom (she doesn’t have the best relationship with her) because she left her for taking to long to get ready so she had to get a ride from her friends mom. I was listening but then the 20 second bell rings so I’m like okay I’m sorry but I really need get to class I don’t wanna be late and she says “No please I really want to talk” and she keeps begging for a bit so I just say “I’m sorry just tell me after class okay?” And walk into the classroom. I felt really bad because I always want to be there for her but it’s just the time she chooses that I just can’t. And I always choose my school before anything but it still just makes me feel like a bad friend. But also it just seems like she doesn’t respect my time. Please help.

      "Body text: AITA if AITA if I told my friend I won't play team games with him if he's gonna play on his Playstation Portal because no offense, it ALWAYS freezes during team games. The thing is, my friend has a PS5 too that works great. And he always wants to game in ranked matches. Often, like 4-5 times a gaming session, he will suddenly disconnect from the party, but because his portal screen freezes, matchmaking fill for a new teammate doesn't happen so our team basically is always down a player. It happens also only when he plays on the Portal, to the point that when it happens, I KNOW when he's playing on that thing. I don't want to hurt his feelings but I've also told him already my frustrations at being suddenly abandoned in matches is not a fun gaming experience. Plus, if he's the one inviting me to play ranked games to help HIM rank up, why keep playing on the device that freezes? Idk what it is, it's like people are hypnotized by the portal. Me personally, I love playstation, but I'm seriously frustrated my friend keeps gaming on the Portal instead of his console during the higher stakes ranked matches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, this all results usually in me making an excuse to get off the game or just admitting I'm a bit frustrated and taking a break for the evening, and my friend gets MAD! Like, dude, try to understand, we played for 3-4 hours and EVERY time we almost won a game, your Portal froze. Now I'm frustrated and hungry, and just want to take a break and do something else. But my friend acts like me doing this is me \"punishing\" him for his game freezing and is VERY passive aggressive about it. \n",

I try to be nice, but it gets repetitive. So, I tell him to mind his own business or something along those lines, and the fight pretty much becomes a full on war lol. I try to ignore him, but then he just keeps talking about my weight, so it gets difficult.

He got really mad and started yelling at my mom and me over Facetime (he’s in India right now with my grandma).

      "I understand why he doesn’t want to work with me, but this is something I’d love to do. I met the politician and liked his ideas.

I’m not trying to take anything away from my brother. I just want to see if doing things like this is right for me in the future, and I want to gain experience now so I’d be better at it later.\n",

      "Myself and a group of six friends were hanging out some time around mid-autumn of 2024. At one point, my buddy Legolas suggests that for Halloween of 2025, we should all dress up as characters from (HIGH SCHOOL GIRL DRAMA). We all spent a max of twenty minutes casting each other for fun. For this story’s major players: Legolas would be (LEAD MEAN GIRL), my guys Pippin and Gimli would be (JOCK DUO), and I would be (LOVE INTEREST). At some point, Gimli actually got a letterman jacket for his costume, but otherwise nobody did anything with these plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "This entire idea goes virtually undiscussed for several months. In mid-April of 2025, Pippin and I were talking, bonding over our mutual love of (WIDELY BELOVED CARTOON INTENDED FOR CHILDREN), and contemplated doing a duo Halloween costume as (ICONIC MC-RIVAL PAIR). We tentatively agreed to do it. It was also understood that Halloween was months away, plans could easily change at any time. A few weeks later, the two of us brought up the idea with Gimli, who seemed chill with it. To boot, the group costume would still be completely identifiable without Pippin or I, and since it was early spring, we didn’t think to tell anyone, since Halloween was (AND STILL IS) a ways away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, while Pippin was at work, he got a text from Legolas. Apparently, Gimli had told Legolas about our alternate costume idea, and Legolas was baffled and upset. He was really looking forward to the group costume, claiming that “we” had been talking about it for months (if these conversations were had, neither Pippin nor I were involved). Things turned aggressive, Pippin vented to me between messaging Legolas, and I offered to talk to Legolas instead, since Pippin was at his job.\n",
      "\n",
      "The texts started calm. I did my best to be placating, given the previous, more heated convo. I apologized and let Pippin and I or just me take the blame for any disagreements brought up. Eventually, once things seemed completely cool, I said “are you going to be destroyed if pippin and i do our thing?” Legolas said he was confused by our decision to change, to which I clarified “it’s a halloween costume. it’s not that deep.” But, apparently, it was that deep. Legolas next brought up how “convenient” it was that Pippin and I didn’t tell anyone, almost as if we were planning to keep our own plans a secret until the last minute to screw over everyone else. I replied that Pippin and I never had any intention of sabotaging the group, and that our plans could just as easily fall through, since once again, it’s a Halloween costume. It’s not that deep. Legolas ended it all with a “You can do whatever you want😊”\n",

      "\n",
      "Then on her trip someone hit and ran her rental car, so she just had these excuses to why she couldn’t pay yet when she got back. Then, she also had my mother do another dog sitting for her business the following week after she returned and paid my mother for that sitting but not for watching her dog. My mother just kept asking about when she could get paid for her dog also. I didn’t really keep tabs on the details between them and idk why I was even brought in the middle of this but here we are.\n",

      "Now today my mother asked again if she was going to get paid for watching cousins dog, so I tried to text her again while I was out doing errands. Admittedly she did send me $80 (out of $120) on cashapp (that I didn’t see) but ignored my text. Eventually while driving I get a notification from her, but she just responds to me with zillow ads talking about moving. So I just repeat the text like hey are you gonna pay my mom and add that was kinda ignorant to just ignore me? (She runs a pet sitting business, paying someone for work shouldn’t be an issue) so i think it is kinda ignorant as a business owner to ignore your employee essentially (was going to hire her but now retaliating) trying to get paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well she got all pissed off and started talking shit because she did just send it, I just didn’t see the alert. She was mad I said it was ignorant after she had already sent it. But to me it seemed like she just ignored my text asking her to pay my mom and sent me houses shes looking at so i thought she was just ignoring the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately she gets mad and we exchange some harsh words back and forth. Keep in mind we can get pretty vulgar with each other being cousins and all. But things got blown out of proportion. So we had a vacation planned for next week that I already got work off approved for and everything and she just uninvited me last min. All because I said it was ignorant to send me house ads and ignore a text asking to pay my mother for watching her dog. After being kicked off the trip, out of rage, I just said she’s ignorant for making me call out of work and messing with my work and income (its’s hard out here) just to tell me to stay home.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’m just venting like I get it’s a whole misunderstanding all because I didn’t see any cashapp notifications. AITA here for thinking that it was rude for her to be ignoring me asking for my mothers’ money, but sending me house ads, and me saying that’s kinda Ignorant to ignore. (Again She runs a pet sitting business, paying someone for work shouldn’t be an issue). And for calling her Ignorant after the fact for inviting me on a trip having me call off work just to un-invite me a week before, all over a misunderstanding.\n",

Flash forward to the next day I’m talking with the gf and getting a gauge on what we wanted to do this weekend and I mention that my buddy will be in town, but ultimately I’m down to do whatever. She then responds by saying word for word “if you want to see him I promise it’ll be okay” and “you don’t have to go I don’t want to force you into anything” so I took that to mean that I had the green light. So we booked a tee time for Sunday morning. I let her know that and said if we still wanted to go up north we could go Friday and spend the night and most of Saturday together then if she wanted to stay longer we could drive separately and I could head home Saturday night as it’s only like an hour and half away. I guess i read her “if you want to see him that’s okay I promise” wrong as now she’s mad at me and says she just isn’t sure about us anymore and won’t elaborate any further. \n",

It was super expensive and I love the thought and I get that he didn't have a lot of color options at the store he went to but at the same time I know he bought it last minute (as in week of/day of Christmas). I did a google search afterwards and almost immediately found the color I actually wanted.

I let my mom know when i got invited, and reminded her I would need a ride the friday before. She asked me where and how far, and she obviously wasn’t a fan of hour long drive it would take.

      "\n",
      "I* & I were cleaning out a storage cupboard today. He found 3 or 4 pics of S & I that I had chucked in the cupboard and forgot about. I tossed them onto the bed and carried on the task. Shortly after I* then took a break on the bed & moved them to lay down. When I tossed them onto the bed they were face-up. He put them face-down. I noticed this but didnt acknowledge it with him as I couldn't be arsed with the inevitable comments that would come (we've had similar talks in the past that tend to end in arguements so I just opt not to engage with certain things now as I just don't see the need to argue over such minor issues). He picked them back up & asked me to do something with them. I asked if what he's actually asking is for me to throw them in the bin (again, previous conversations have set the tone) & he said to do I want, but he doesn't see why I want to keep them when he was this, that, the other, cheated, etc. I replied that I don't know if I want to keep them or not but I am a sentimental person, I do have boxes with various items in from my past relationships/life in general & that right now I'm not thinking about what to do with them as I'm more concerned about why he continually feels so threatened by any evidence of my relationship with S (& others, or just friendships with guys in general). I explained that while yes, S ultimately wound up being a Douche, that the entire relationship wasn't awful & that he is the man in my life now, the man in my bed every night & the man I'm making plans for my future with. I also highlighted he has pictures of his ex on his phone that I have never once asked him to delete, nor would I as 1) I don't feel threatened by his past relationships & 2) I would never expect him to just erase an entire part of his life from a time before he knew me. At our age people have histories and stories to tell from a life before we ever knew the other existed. Its baffling to me to feel threatened by that fact in itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I kept asking to carry on with the task & it was clear he was in a negative mood. After some back & forth I gave up & walked away. He called after me & asked what I was going to do with them then & so petty me engaged & called back \"I'm gonna hang them on the wall so they can stare at you every day!\". Not helpful, I know. But my patience only goes so far.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, is it unfair of me to keep photos/mementoes from previous relationships (not on display, just in boxes)? Am I being blasé about it, & not giving fair thought to how it could make him feel? Or would I be justified in telling him that upon giving it some thought I am going to keep them, as I typically would, & he just needs to deal with that fact any which way he see's fit?\n",

I offer her advice, try to steer her in the right direction, and call her out when she’s veering off track—firstborns will understand. Recently, though, I’ve realized she doesn’t really take my guidance seriously. I’ve watched her make deliberate, significant life mistakes, knowing our parents will always bail her out, and I’ll step in to try to set her straight. It feels like she’s stuck in this cycle, but I’m growing exhausted from constantly trying to help her become a better person. Lately, I’ve started feeling a strong resentment (maybe even hatred) toward her, and it’s draining my energy. Her toxic behavior seems careless, and her choices are starting to cost the family financially. Has anyone dealt with a toxic sibling before, and how did you handle it?

A month later, my younger daughter died in my arms in the hospital.

I have not changed my name legally yet, but when I do, there will be 2 people in the family with the same first and last name. Some members of my family have come to me and made jabs about the fact of \"oh, well that's the baby's name, you know,\" as if I weren't the one who chose the name before the baby was born.

In my country you can only attend to university exam once in a year and all universities recure this exam to attend. Me and my friend attended to it last year and both didnt get the results we wanted so we are trying again this year. Since exam is so important and  last year we were still going to last year of high school so it was normal to not have time. Now we are both at usually at home and studying. Last summer we were planing a lot to hang out since we werent expecting to fail. And she said she dont want to hear any complain and planed a week long vacation(we planned together but she was the one invite me). So since we had to much in plan i didnt get a summer job as i planned. But at the end of summer we hang out like 3 days total and it was even because i begged. I got heartbroken and said it to her face too. So time passed we got over it and i didnt argue about meeting with her more than few times because i got tired of getting rejected. To this day. There is a festival at our city and nice concert. Im a socially awkward person so in a events like this i need to glue myself to a person to enjoy it. I invited her week ago and she said \"yeah but no promises\". So i was planing clothed so i texted her to ask and she said she isnt coming. The part i might be asshole. I literally begged her to come and how i cant go without her. Then got mad(i will confess that i tried guilt tripping because how much she ditched me) when she said she decided to not vome right after i asked. Like why didnt u told me earlier? I was planing that day for a week with all my energy and now im just sad. I dont even know if i can enjoy the concert even if i go. Was i right to react this way or am i the asshole for acting like this?\n",

It’s bothered me so much I started crying at the Willy Wonka movie because of how much I missed my mom (the scene where the mother and kid reunited).

He says that he understands because he’s been through his own depression, but he gets furious when I don’t wash dishes or help with the laundry. I have been working on that, usually he sends me texts to wash dishes and clean my room and I do, but the times I don’t he starts yelling and ranting about how nobody helps him around this place. It makes me sad, especially because he seems to only expect me to help out when I also have a younger sister (three years younger, she’s not a toddler or anything).

This obviously didn’t help, but I don’t really know if I was in the wrong.\n",

      "Body text: I 24f agreed to 6 total days of working conventions for a little gimmick business my friend and I do at farmers markets. I have a job and put those days in. Today she added four total days which is hotel fees per night and four days off more from work. She said I was “taking away” from the trip for driving my self so that I could still do the days she added. Then said I owed her those days anyways even if they weren’t scheduled. THEN said she didn’t care if she was being unreasonable she “said what she said”. I got mad because I’ve worked farmers markets alone, clubs alone, and constantly clean our little storage unit alone but the first time I asked for driving alone so I’d show up the day early she added just half way through (this isn’t even a day of the convention) to be told I OWED it to her to go early and that I was taking away from a trip because I wanted to make 300+ at work and not add more money in hotel fees … I got very angry. I pay for the unit, I clean the unit, I work alone and never complained when I did, and the moment I need a half day I’m ruining the trip? She thinks I’m doing the half day over nothing and should just take off all four days of work (imagine half a week of pay just gone) for a hobby that I’ve been responsible and committed to this whole time. Should I just drop it?? \n",

      "Body text: So, I (16m) went on a school trip a year ago and my friend (16f) asked me to sit with her on the bus. Well at some point on the trip we believe we saw two people making out (not sure if that's 100% the case now), but anyway it was getting awkward so I blurted out \"Maybe we should be next\"....stupid joke, I know. Well she laughed at what I said so I figured that was that. Well the week following the trip I went to sit at my usual lunch table and they said no; wierd, but not unusual because I hop from table to table. Well the next day, same issue. I decide to not try for the rest of the week (I figured it was a rough week). Well Friday afternoon comes around and I get a message from her boyfriend threating me to \"never lay hands on her again\" (What?), not sure how he thought that even happened to this day. Well I'm confused so I say ok and message another person from my group and asked what happened, well he says that what I did was f***ed up. (???) He says I told her that \"I wanted to kiss her\". I never said those words and it just wasn't true. I ask her why she told our friend group I said that, when she knows I didn't (the people in front of us confirmed that I didn't and that she laughed). She says I should've known that would make her uncomfortable. I apologized that I made her uncomfortable, but asked why she went behind my back and didn't tell me until a week later, and she kept making excuses, so we argued back and forth for awhile, we blocked each other and I lost a lot of friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skip to summer, I see some of those friends at a party and they tell me they felt bad for what happened and we chatted for awhile. Later that summer right before school started I messaged that girl and said something like \"I'm sorry again for what happened and I just want to be at least neutral towards each other\". School starts we don't talk, until I chat a couple times start getting closer to my old friends again and even reconnect two of my friends that had issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we are at current times, that friend groups treats me poorly again, my friends that I reconnected replaced me in that group, the one friend I thought I could trust told me no one liked me, and now I'm contemplating switching schools. I don't know why everything changed so badly over the course of this year because I didn't change from the start of the year. And added context I apologized several times for that joke and I know it was a bad joke. What I really mean is AITA for how I treated the situation in the first place?\n",

I would arrive Friday and leave Sunday after the party. My friend would only get to her hometown on Sunday but Ben said he would be in town the whole week and so would be there Saturday/Sunday so we could meet up while we were there (HIS IDEA). I’ll admit, the idea of seeing him again was probably the main reason I agreed to go to the party in the first place, which in fairness he didn't know. I had texted him twice in the week before the party to try and make a plan, and he just responded with vague “yeah we’ll work something out”. On Saturday, I made the 6-hour journey and spent the day killing time as he said he would be free after dinner and that there was a club near the place I was staying that we could go to with one of his friends and we confirmed these plans.\n",

      "These plans were finalized at 9:30pm, and I had just sat down to dinner. I rushed through my food as I wanted time to get ready and texted him for an idea of what time he’d come meet me. He didn’t reply for til 11pm and said he’d let me know after dinner. I was getting a bit pissed but fine. I then go to a bar by myself. At 1am I see the club we were going to start closing. I text him to ask again if he has an idea of timings and told him we might need a new plan since the club we were going to go to was closing. He replied at about 1:30am saying they were trying to make a plan, at which point I left the bar to go back to where I was staying because I was getting sad looks from the bartender. I was exhausted, having only 1.5h of sleep the night before due to the long travel. I texted him a few times over the next hour and a bit asking if we were still going out and he only replied the once saying they were still planning. I lay in my bed until 3am waiting to hear from him with my dress and make up on, hair still done… just in case. In the end I told him I just had to go to sleep and I did, and I checked in the morning and he hadn’t even replied to that. He was supposed to be taking me to the party on Sunday, so I texted him to ask when he was picking me up, (party started at 3pm) and he texted me at 2:45 saying he’d left town to go back home and he wasn’t going to the party. I think this whole thing was so so beyond rude and disrespectful of my time, but my best friend said I was being too clingy and that scared him off. I don’t think I was being clingy by wanting to know what our plans were.\n",

When I arrive home (I work at a bar, I didn’t get home until 2:30 in the morning) I find the ground beef sitting on the countertop. Astonished, I go upstairs and wake my mom up, and ask how long the beef has been out. She says 9 pm. I started to have a panic attack, what the hell are we supposed to do? I yelled “why the fuck would you be so irresponsible and leave the meat out do you just not give a fuck?” And I went downstairs to try to check the temp of the beef. It was still cold to the touch, but probably in the danger zone no matter what. Guessing around 50 degrees idk I’m not a food scientist I’m just a chef with a food thermometer at my work. Regardless, she comes downstairs and tells me it was actually 11. I went off on her about food safety and how you can’t be so careless especially when dealing with food for so many people. She just kept telling me that it was fine because the house is cold, and I showed her a google search that would prove my point entirely. Practically speaking, it was sealed meat on a dark cool countertop but I was heated in the moment. She kept arguing with me and it got to the point of her discrediting me saying “you take one test on food safety” and I said “are you kidding me you fucking fuck?” Obviously I don’t think of her as a fucking fuck but I was angry in the moment and she was being completely irresponsible. I don’t think that warranted my language, as I have apologized for. But I do think my anger was warranted \n",

My oldest (40 m) has expressed wanting to look into cremation costs hoping to find a reasonably affordable price. My father didn’t have life insurance, so it would be paid for out of pocket or through some assistance program that helps you with death accommodations. The thing is, I don’t really care either way. I know that everyone has their own grief when mourning a loss and it’s a different process for everyone. But to be blunt, I didn’t like my father. My father was a narcissist and he spent his life antagonizing our family. My entire family feels the exact same way. We all have our grievances and pretty much share trauma that has affected us well into adulthood. My issue with the idea of cremation is do in part to his behaviors over the last couple of years. He was very financially abusive. He never paid his portion of rent. Because of this, it was very hard to make it through each month on what little money we had. We being (my mother 69, my brother 32, and myself) because of the extra money that we had to put out every month, it was tiring and draining trying to collect resources for food, or even trying to save money for emergencies or anything else.\n",

      "Title: AITA for putting dishes on the floor for my dogs to lick?\n",
      "Body text: My husband and I have 2 dogs. I grew up with dogs, my husband did not. In my house, we always put the dishes on the floor for the dogs to lick, and when I got my first dog, I always did the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just for some context, we have always had “issues” with our dishwasher. Mainly my husband being the one to have issues. Because I put the dishes down for the dogs to lick clean, there is usually not food on them and so they come through the dishwasher looking perfect. My husband does not scrape or soak plates, and as a result, there have been times when plates have come out with food still stuck on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based off this, my husband has this idea that our dishwasher doesn’t clean dishes. This is where our disagreement began. He started insisting that if dogs lick the plates, they needed to be hand washed. I told him this was ridiculous since our dishwasher has a sanitize feature, but he insisted it was not hygienic for the dogs to lick them because he thinks our dishwasher doesn’t work. I told him if he wanted to hand wash them, he could, but this added more work for me, so I didn’t want to do it.\n",
      "I usually clean up and load the dishwasher, so after this, I started to just be more subtle about letting the dogs lick the dishes. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, recently, my husband has been becoming increasingly upset about this. He told me he doesn’t want the dogs licking the plates at all (hand-washed or going into the dishwasher). We had a conversation where I repeated that this adds significant work for me. I asked if he would be willing to scrap the plates then, as well as do the extra maintenance of cleaning the dishwasher drain more often, and he said no. He said that needs to be a separate conversation and is irrelevant. He said he just wants me to respect that he doesn’t want dogs licking his dishes. I understand that, but I also feel like he is disrespecting my time since he refuses to help with the extra clean up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just want to add a disclaimer that this is a petty, ridiculous and on the grand scale of things, an insignificant argument, and that both my husband and I recognize that. We have started laughing about the absurdity of it in the middle of going back and forth, but we are both pretty stubborn people when we think we are right.\n",

      "Title: WIBTA if I refuse to pay my ex friend back for a concert ticket?\n",
      "Body text: Back in November, my now ex friend bought two concert tickets. one for her, and one with the initial intention for me. The plan was for me to pay her back (it was a causal thing saying “if you buy it Ill pay you back” and I asked her to lmk when I should but she never mentioned it again). She bought both tickets on her account and never once asked for payment or offered to transfer the ticket to me. After that, we both  forgot about it/let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to later that month, we had a majour argument and our friendship ended. We went months with absolutely no contact and I forgot about the concert. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then out of the blue, she texts me. She asks if I want the ticket. and to let her know so I can pay her. I replied honestly, \"No, I don't think I can go anymore,\" and suggested she sell it. However, she's now requesting I pay her $100 and \"accept\" the ticket, claiming it's \"my ticket” saying “I’m sorry to hear that but we did get the ticket for you so it’s yours to go ahead and sell it if you’d like but I would still appreciate if you could pay me back for the ticket and I can give it to you to do what you wish with it” (I understand it’s ‘only’ 100 but I don’t have that money since the concert is next week and it was out of the blue and I don’t want to go and it’s literally not mind and she already paid for it so it’s not like she ‘needs’ the money) \n",
      "\n",
      "My side is this. How can it be \"my ticket\" when I never paid for it, it remained on her account, and she never once followed up on payment? It feels like she bought two tickets for herself with an option for me, an option that expired when we stopped being friends and she failed to act on it.\n",
      "\n",
      " To make matters worse, if she did transfer the ticket to me now, I wouldn't be able to sell it. She's already going with two other people, so it's not like she's stuck without a concert buddy. She bought these tickets so long ago, why is she just now bringing this up after all this time? \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that is totally understandable and I am trying to perceive her side as I understand I would owe her, BUT I believe the moment we stopped being friends, we were no longer going together and that ticket is now considered hers. I can’t sell the ticket once I receive it and she’s going with two other people so she could easily invite someone else and she wouldn’t be alone or she could sell it herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year I bought other tickets and didn’t mention the prices and was fine with her not paying me back as it would’ve been a nice gesture but she insisted so I let her pay less than it was originally. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my mind, yes it was mine but were not friends and were not going together anymore so you find someone to get the ticket. I would pay her back if I had the ticket but I don’t want to claim the ticket because now it’s her responsibility now that we aren’t friends. How can it be my ticket when I never paid for it, it remained on her account, and she never once followed up on payment? \n",

      "Title: AITA for making my brother's cat cry?\n",
      "Body text: I (20F) live with my 19-year-old brother and our dad in a small apartment. About three months ago, my brother got an orange cat that's friendly with all of us but is only allowed to stay in his room. It’s to control shedding, prevent furniture damage, and since it’s his cat, he’s the one who takes care of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important context: the cat has **serious** separation anxiety. If my brother leaves the room even just to grab water, the cat starts screaming and won’t stop until he returns. Cat usually cries for 5 to 10 minutes before quieting down. Since my brother goes to college, hangs out with friends, and is out of the house a lot, the cat ends up crying constantly. We’ve all gotten used to it at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I go in the room (with permission), the cat might quiet down a little but clearly prefers my brother. He doesn’t really care for me and it shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, one day I asked my brother (like I always do) if I could go into his room to see the cat. My brother was in the living room playing Fortnite and gave me a clear yes. So I went in, closed the door, and found the cat loafed up on the cat tree. I pet him and tried to play with him, but he wasn’t that interested. After a few minutes, I left the room. As expected, the cat immediately started crying at the door again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for some reason, this time my brother got annoyed and said, “You woke my cat up! Now he’s crying,” and acted really pissy. I was confused because he’s never cared about the crying before, and it happens every day. I’ve visited his room before with permission, and it was never a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he told me, “You owe me for making my cat cry.” We had a small argument where I said I didn’t owe him anything, pointed out the cat always cries anyway, and reminded him he could’ve just said no if he didn’t want me going in. After that, we both just went to our rooms. I figured it was just a dumb sibling argument and didn’t think much of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now he hasn’t spoken to me in almost **three weeks**. I thought he was just being moody and would get over it, but apparently not. I told our dad about the situation and he told me I should apologize to 'just to be the bigger person' but I don't think that's fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should I? I had permission to go in, and the cat does this all the time. I really don’t see what I did wrong. I also don’t plan on apologizing because this whole thing feels ridiculous but idk.\n",

I spent the night on Amazon and managed to find a few things I liked. Today when I showed her she got upset because I didn't want one of the pre-made sets and instead wanted a dress, a corset, and a skirt. She said that buying me the all would be to expensive. I told her that was fine and I was ok with her just getting me the corset if she would take me thrifting. She once again said I wasn't going to find anything when doing that and started to make me look at the pre-made sets again. I tried to tell her I already looked though them all and didn't like any of them but that just made her more upset. I ended up getting tired of arguing with her and left to go back to my room. \n",

      "Body text: I (16M) usually keep my face clean shaven. And yesterday when shaving my face after a week of not shaving I kept it in the shape of a goatee. People have been saying it looks good but I still wanted to get everybody’s opinion on it. So when my sister (14F) walked out of her room to make a bowl of cereal this morning (very rare to see her outside the room), I asked her the simple question of “fuck with it?” And pointed to my goatee. I didn’t get an answer so I repeated it. To which she snapped at me and said all I ever speak about to her is my appearance (while I do ask about my appearance from time to time this is not true). I was little taken aback because I was just expecting a little answer along the lines of “it looks good” or something like that. I felt her reaction was a little bit uncalled for so I started saying a rebuttal that I can’t recall because my mom (47F) also felt she was out of line and decided to correct her at the same time. It felt like we were ganging up on her when I just wanted to tell her that she was being rude. After this she didn’t say a word and took her bowl of cereal and quickly left to her room. I was just left standing there rethinking the situation in my mind and that’s why I wanted to make this vent post. Because I felt her initial reaction was rude but I couldn’t even say my two sense without it feeling like I was ganging up on her. Anyways I don’t know how to end this so AITAH?\n",

      "Body text: My parents have moved out of our familial home in favor of something smaller, although they still own this house and my siblings and I have moved back in and are paying the mortgage. The problem is that they also left behind about 20 cats, ranging from friendly to feral, all outside exclusively. They are all spayed and neutered to their credit—however, they have completely destroyed the local wildlife. Growing up in this home I remember so many different birds that used to always be present in the backyard, which is now devoid of any wildlife. Still everyday I’m finding dead mice, shrews, moles, squirrels, and whatever birds are unfortunate enough to wander onto our land. Most are barely eaten and obviously killed for sport—all of the cats are fed well.\n",

      "Today really pushed me over the edge. I noticed a birds nest above my door, and today was the first time I heard the pips from babies. I was so excited about it and thought to myself how I’d be able to protect the nest better. I left my house for two hours and came back to the mother dead in front of my door, not eaten at all, just killed. The nest was obviously disturbed and blood was present around it. All babies were eaten.\n",

I want to post some of the nicer cats on Facebook for anyone who wants a mouser for their barn or something similar, some of them would even be excellent house cats. However, we already have 5 indoor cats and are not looking to add to that number. Any cats that I can’t rehome, I want to bring to a shelter, and I don’t care if it’s kill or no kill. It is so unfair to every other living creature anywhere on our property, which used to be a quiet oasis of butterflies, birds, deer, etc. Now all that’s here is the faint aroma of cat piss everywhere you go.\n",

      "Body text: My neighbors are pretty ghetto. I don’t live in the ghetto; it’s come to me. For some background as to the type of people they are: they used to stay awake all night and drink beer in their backyard and blast shitty music while screaming “wooo” and generally being crazy. I called the cops on them for doing this because that sort of activity on a Wednesday at 3 a.m. is incompatible with me sleeping.Anyway, they have decided that they can still party by sitting in their shitty pickup truck and drinking out by the street, which is fine with me because they don’t wake me up and they can have their fun, a win-win. However, they leave their beer cans and paper plates from food either in the street or lying out on the easement. I asked them not to, and they pretend to not understand me. So, I just throw the cans onto their lawn. Their father, I’m assuming, because there are 6-8 30-ish men that live there and he is in his 60s, always keeps the yard clean but doesn’t seem to discipline them, which, if their upbringing was very laissez-faire, makes a lot of sense.

      "Body text: My bf(M27) argued with me (F28) about how I barely post him. This is not the first time we’ve spoken about this topic, but it seems to keep coming up whenever I talk about posting on my instagram. For context, I have a little over 2000 followers and I mostly post where I travel, random aesthetically pleasing photos and myself all in tasteful fashion. I want to say I post every 3-4 months out of the year and I mostly post stories like 1-3 times a week, so in my opinion not that often. For stories it’s me at the gym, what I’m eating, sometimes what I’m doing with friends and again a selfie now and then. My bf and I have been dating for about 1 year and 3 months. I’ve posted him on my story for “national boyfriend day” in October, for his birthday, for our anniversary and for Valentine’s Day. He did have to ask me to post him in October, for our anniversary and for Valentine’s Day though, even though at first he said I didn’t have to but he wanted me to, so I did. I do have one picture of him on my instagram along with other pics of where we went to vacation together, but I don’t have him tagged. He said he feels a bit insecure about the random guys I follow on there and who like my pictures, but I honestly don’t talk to them or pay them any mind, I’m barely on there to begin with but I’ve had it since high school so I don’t want to make a new one from scratch. I like my privacy which is why I don’t post too much about my life and with my relationship before I was the same way. I’d post stories with him here and there but not too much, so is he right to feel like I don’t want to show him off or am I the asshole? \n",

      "Body text: first post here, sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "so this literally just happened and I need some help. my (29M) girlfriend of four years and I were video chatting on Discord, but she disconnected after saying \"she can't\" with me right now and she needs a break from me. she was sharing some tattoo ideas dedicated to her late grandfather who passed away last year, and she shared that he was a silly guy and always had a lot of funny/silly lines to say to them on repeat. I won't go into detail about his \"quotes,\" but they were mostly pun-related or in broken English (idk how else to describe them). I thought it was cute and wondered if there's a chance he might have been autistic, so I asked her. she got offended and asked me if I was serious/joking and why I would ask her that. I told her I'm genuinely curious about it and interested what she thinks. we've watched a few episodes of Love on the Spectrum so we both don't associate autism with any negative connotation-- it's just something some people have and that's fine, so I was surprised that she took offense to my question. I think she viewed it as I was making a joke or making fun of her recently-passed grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sincerely did not mean to offend and I wasn't saying her granddad WAS autistic-- I was just trying to ask her opinion and have a conversation about it. I tried asking her, \"why do you seem offended by that?\" but she didn't give me any straightforward answer. she just asked me if I think just being silly meant that someone was autistic. I said no, but I was just genuinely curious about what she thought. then she asked me, \"do you think you're narcissistic because you seem to care more about yourself and what people think of you than me or our relationship?\" and I got caught off guard and didn't know what to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I admit it's been a reoccurring problem for us where sometimes I break a boundary or forget something that she told me before, especially when other parties are involved (I've got people pleaser issues that I'm trying to get better at), and it makes her feel like I care less about her than how other people see me. in response to her asking if I think I'm narcissistic, I just said \"I hope not\" if that's what constitutes as narcissism. that's when she disconnected and said she needed a break from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know she loves her grandfather very much and she was heartbroken when he passed away. I know now that it was a mistake to ask her that because she's still sensitive about it and got mad at me for it.

I didn't realize how tactless I behaved. I let my curiosity get the better of me instead of just being empathetic to my partner's vulnerability sharing stuff she loved about her late grandfather. and then I even tried to justify it and defend myself instead of apologizing because it upset her.\n",

So my mom gets the text/email stating that i have to go to summer school but she's making me pay the 500 for it which is fine with me she takes my phone and all my other things, so im over here thinking its gonna be maybe 2 weeks or even a month for the most, but no 5 months later, and which is utter bs because she told me that i could get it back if i brought my grades up which not even 3 weeks after of me grounded i maintained a A-B in All my classes my lowest was C  Which not trying to play the victim card but this is a hard ass school in Louisiana some top 15 or some shit. but anyways i would always ask for my phone back and my parents would give me some stupid ass answer like the following: \"until we feel like it\" \"your grades are fake\" or some other bullshit. first of all how in the world can you fake grades, i aint that smart. So i got fed up with it (ps my grandpa pays for all the phone bills not my parents)  So about a week ago i took my phone back from there little hiding spot and keep in mind i have a gf during all this snap web really helped with that lol. So Boom i take my phone they dont notice for that amount of time then i go back to my grandpas house and last night around 6-7 my step dad calls me pissed asf \"why didnt you ask, your a fucking liar and blah blah blah\" which multiple times i have asked constantly oh and btw i finished my sophomore year with a 3.9 GPA, its just such bs  also thanks for reading :) \n",

      "Body text: Where I work and what I do are not relevant, so I'm skipping that. I have a coworker who collects Pokemon cards. He offered me $50 to stand in line for him to get the re-release of evolving skies ETB (like a 6 hour line up). Instead, I found one for sale in one of those pokemon vending machines and tried to sell it to him for the same markup he already offered me. This was a separate transaction and he tried to make me feel bad about it.\n",

      "We haggled it down to +$30 over what I paid, which is less than the +$50 he already offered for a separate transaction.

      "\n",
      "The action in question is basically \"does this context allow for scalping\"? And I feel wrong because I am kind of a hypocrite due to how much I complain about the PC community for the same actions.\n",

      "I have a friend. One of two in the whole world. Her name is Mary. I was even a maid of honour in her wedding last August. In my country you can have two maids of honour so it was me and the grooms best friend, Irene. \n",
      "Mary and Irene came really close this past year and me and Mary have grown apart. \n",
      "To be honest I was the one that put some distance between us, mainly because of financial reasons. Meaning, as a maid of honour I had to pay for a good sum of her wedding (as that's the custom here) but she never asked what my budget was and never asked for my input on these things. When I told her I couldn't be her maid of honour cause I couldn't afford it she said we'll figure it out. So in the end I got stuck with a bill for things I didn't even know she'd gotten. All top quality and extravagant. I still owe her about half of that money.\n",
      "Onto the main story. Two weeks ago she told me her and a few of Irene's friends were throwing her a surprise party and asked if I'd be able to attend. I told her I had a wedding to attend to (true) and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to come back in time. She said that's fine and then told me of all the gifts they'd get her as a group. They thought it'd be best to get a bunch of things and split it amongst them, so she said it wouldn't be that expensive. Like 10-12€ each. I said ok thats reasonable, as I've only seen Irene 10 times maybe. \n",
      "The day of the party comes and I couldn't attend. I went home around 12 at night so I went straight to bed. \n",

      "Anyway, the first night my friend would be home alone while I was called in to do overtime at work. After finishing up my work, I opened my phone and I saw that my friend had contacted me about a man that had showed up at the house, asking about the previous tenants, and then propositioning her after she explained they didn't live there anymore. While she said he didn't leave right away, it seemed like he was gone by the time she sent the message. Her voice was shaky in the voice message and I know that she's had bad experiences with men in the past so I obviously know she felt bad, but the situation had passed. She said she still felt gross and unsafe, but I think that's a little dramatic. I texted her that I had finished work and would be there as soon as I could. It might be important to note that she has no family here, as I convinced her to move across the country with me, otherwise I would have told her to call one of them.

      "\n",
      "Usually on weekends, my partner and I like to call and stay up really late since we don’t have school the next day. But for a while, we couldn’t because I had to wake up at 5:30 AM for tennis provincials. I also hadn’t seen them in a while since I wasn’t at school. So with tennis finally over, I was really excited to call and spend time with them. I’d missed them so much, and I needed to relax after the stress (also, we lost)\n",
      "When I mentioned calling later, they told me they were going to a rave. I was confused since we had made plans the day before, but they said they forgot to tell me about the rave. This really got to me. I don’t handle being left behind or feeling alone very well, especially with people I care about. I’ve been left behind by friends and even past partners before—on my last birthday, a partner left me to go drink with friends. So situations like this hit hard, especially when I’m already struggling emotionally. My partner isn’t the best with timing; if they say they’ll call in 5 or 10 minutes, it often ends up being much later. This makes me expect the worst, like or \"they’re going to cancel on me.\" I had a bad feeling they’d cancel today, and while I hoped they wouldn’t, well you know the outcome.\n",
      "I was feeling upset, not at them specifically, but at the situation and how I felt. I ended up asking if I was a bad girlfriend for wanting them to leave early to call, and they told me I wasn’t a bad partner, just \"needy.\" I’m an overthinker and very insecure, so I took that as an insult. They said they wanted to call me, but also really wanted to go to the rave. I told them to go, because I don’t want to talk to someone who would rather be somewhere else. They said it was fine, but I don’t believe that. They had to leave for work, and here I am, overthinking everything and feeling like a bad partner. Just to clarify: we weren’t arguing or yelling. Just talking and planning. I'm not angry, just sad.\n",

      "Update (don’t know if my comment worked, I'm new here): I want to clarify some things: My parents don’t think I need therapy, so it’s been hard to get help. I’m still trying. Also, my mom forced me to join the school tennis team even though I didn’t want to. About my partner, I know I could have handled things better. Before provincials, we both wanted to talk, but I told him I couldn’t. When he didn’t tell me in advance, I felt down. That’s on me. I didn’t mean to make him sound like a bad person, he’s not, and I appreciate him. I’m also not the best at writing, so sorry if that’s how it came across. When we talked he offered to leave the rave early for me, but we just finished calling after his work, and I told him not to. I apologized for being sad about it, and even though I was still a bit, I needed to learn to be left alone. He apologized for not telling me in advance.\n",

My mother was driving, and me and my sister were on our phones. I don't know what my sister was doing, but I was texting my friend. We got to the laundry mat, and I put my mother and mine's load in as my sister put her load in. My mother waited in the car. I didn't take too long to finish putting the load, laundry detergent, fabric softener, and quarters in.

I tried to explain that this was normal, as did my mother, but she wasn't having any of it. She kept telling my mother that she'd raised me a brat, and that I had no respect for my elders. She even somehow got it into her head that I'd end up physically assaulting my mother, to put it lightly. She went on for a while. It felt like it would never end. I ended up zoning out most of what she said. By the time she was done, the clothes were nearly done washing, and we had to go back in to put them in the dryer. It was pretty tense for the rest of time we spent there and the drive back. She even tried to convince my mother to let her come with us to our apartment.

Me: We will do it another time :) No more dialogue until this morning - Dad: When you come to the house with Pip my heart sinks. It means im going to have a dog in my home for 2 days. You continue to ignore the fact that I don't like dogs. You are all more than welcome but please don't bring a dog to my home”- This feels like my family is not welcome, and will make it very logistically difficult to visit my dad (he doesn’t come out much).

      "Body text: So, this year I, alongside another boy, was in charge of the yearbook of my school. Similarly to most, everyone would get a portrait and they'd be put in a book with their name. One of my close friends, a trans girl, had come to me saying that she didn't want to be in the yearbook since she didn't want her deadname to be in the book. As a trans person myself, I completely understood. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told her okay, and didn't include her. When I was putting all the portraits in, I purposefully didn't include hers. A few days later, I see the other boy had put her in. He didn't know about her trans status, so it's understandable, but I silently removed her without telling him. Another day or two goes by, and I check again only to see that she's been put up again. I really didn't want to continually remove the photo because I knew I'd be asked about it, and I didn't want to out her to someone without her permission or knowledge. \n",

      "Body text:  I accidentally broke a bowl a few months ago. I apologised in the group chat and offered to replace it. At the time my housemate seemed very blasé and not bothered about it. Fast forward to about 4 months later and I'm moving out. The housemate has sent me the website from the artist who made the bowl and asked me to send him money for it - I'm talking 80-110AUD. And the bowls on the site are a bit fancier and more effort has clearly gone into making them than the one I broke. The one I broke is not listed. I'm up to offering much less money (another reason being I am not as well off as my ex housemate and we view and spend money differently.) \n",
      "Am I the asshole if I say I don't want to pay for another bowl full price?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I DID offer to pay at the time, nothing came of that conversation. Would have been nice if they’d asked then and not when I’m moving out as finances have changed. The group chat was the house group which is 3 of us. The other 2 are best friends, so the fact I posted in there is a non-issue. There’s every chance the money won’t go towards the bowl. Honestly if my expensive things were up for use in a house share and someone damaged something like a bowl i wouldn’t expect full price back. I’m not trying to get out of paying at all, but to me that price is an insane amount for a bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: turns out the original bowl cost $30-$40 ( I asked the maker) so the prices he’s sent from a different maker are way above. Is this ok because I owe him? Because of inflation??\n",

I was looking at a shelf trying to find something when i heard that scraping sound behind me. As i turned i said \"lift your feet, please.\" I did not yell, but my tone wasn't the nicest, i think i was clearly exasperated. Standing behind me was a woman in her, i think, late 40s. She glared at me, and shuffled off muttering something about rude people. While i stood there like a stunned mullet, not knowing what to say. After a few moments i gave my son a hug and apologised to him for assuming it was him. \n",

      "So I've been in colorguard for almost two years and this happened a few months ago at the state champs for Winterguard(competition season). There’s one girl on my team who we'll just call B, who definitely has a learning disability of some sort and doesn’t process the instructions given very easily. She and I happened to be next to each other during warmups and afterward we had to fold our flag silks a specific way, and I noticed she was doing it a different way. i pointed this out to her as nicely as i could and she simply replied with “no i’m not”, so we went back and forth for a little bit before she out of nowhere goes “shut up you’re just a dumb f*ggot, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”(I'm bi). This obviously stunned me but we were leaving to perform and the show must go on so I just followed the crowd, though I was pretty much zoned out thinking about that for the whole performance. \n",

The girl next to me had a crease in her section of the floor and I tried to point it out but it came out sounding angry. The girl next to her told me to calm down and I yelled back something to the extent of “i’m trying to!”. The assistant coach heard this and screamed at me to not yell at others, and this led me to start tearing up so I ran out of the room and started to have a breakdown due to sensory overload. \n",
      "\n",
      "About ten minutes later the coach and assistant coach came out to where I was questioning why I ran out and I started to explain, but as soon as I mentioned what B said they immediately shut me down. they denied that i was ever called a slur and then said that 1 i need to stop making things up about people, 2 i'm not the victim, and 3 that everyone feels like they’re walking on eggshells around me because of the times i snap at people, and they said all of this while i was still shaking and crying. After all of that they told me to fix my makeup and come back to where everyone else was for lunch before our second performance, and then left me there. \n",

I've had a crush on him ever since I was in like 7th grade but we never really talked to each other, probably just because I was young, so my feelings died down. Now we all go to the same school and I went to a hangout with both of them & a bunch of friends. Just like in HS, Evan is the life of the party, talking to everyone, super friendly and charismatic. All the feelings I had for him kind of came back in that moment.\n",

I asked him what he meant, and he said that Evan *just* went through this huge breakup with a girl he had been dating since high school and he's basically sworn off of dating forever. I felt really sick to my stomach in that moment honestly because we're all pretty devout Christians. I've never dated anybody, neither has Adam AFAIK and I figured Evan was the same way, it was kind of hard to reconcile that with what I know of him plus I've never seen him with a girl ever. That was basically the end of the conversation, I felt pretty heartbroken and messed up about it all.\n",

For some backstory, the reason he says I'm insane is that I've spoken to my parents about him and they agree that we would be a good match.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he knows I think I'm in love with him but I've never spoken to him, I've never hung out with him and literally all I know about him is how he acted in the hallways in high school. He says he's talked to Evan about it and Evan would never date the sibling of someone he's friends with. Obviously I freaked out about this and asked why he would go behind my back to talk to Evan about me and he said that Evan's the one that brought it up and that he was talking about a separate situation.\n",

      "My thoughts on this are that if it's a separate situation then a) obviously Evan isn't 100% done with dating and b) situations are different so just because he wouldn't date someone else's sibling it doesn't mean he wouldn't date me. So Adam really just gave me reasons to pursue Evan instead of leaving him alone LOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked Adam if he could just put in a good word for me with Evan, or set something up where he and I can have a conversation, or IDK do something so that I can actually do what he says and see that Evan and I click. He told me there was no way in hell he was going to do that. I'll admit I might be the AH here but I called him a bad brother and said he just didn't want us to date because it would be weird for him. He told me to leave it alone and just please drop it.\n",

Now I KNOW I was the AH here because I did it intentionally but I told him if he takes over the power bill ill take over the internet, knowing that the internet was going to be a set steady price all year round (which isn't true since it price hiked 3 times since I've lived there) and the power bill would fluctuate.\n",

This was never really a talk with my roommate it just kinda happened. When she first moved in she had no problem contributing, she bought groceries and often would outright pay the powerbill for him even though he paid nothing else other than rent. However due to personal reasons she no longer works. She still gets food benefits so all the food in the house is usually her benefits and she keeps the house spotless as a way to continue to contribute. Hes still adamant that with the extra person that things all of a sudden need to be split up again to justify the extra power being used. Again hes got a much better paying job and anytime we get on eachother he loves to remind me he \"doesn't need my help to pay anything and can pay for this place on my own\" even though 2 weeks ago he was crying about only having 90 dollars in his bank account. I've never asked for help with the internet, never been late on it even when I worked a worse job, I just paid it no questions asked. It costs me $115 a month and the power bill is $161. WIBTAH to just give him the difference? Should I even give him that just to keep the peace? I dont know why he would expect help ive never asked for and get to only pay his half of rent.\n",

      "I (M18) have been home with my mom and sister (F20) for the summer for a few days now. The situation started when I went to grab some food from the fridge, and saw my sister making herself ice cream. She'd decked it out with chocolate syrup and whipped cream, and I thought it was funny how much was on there. I snorted after seeing it, and she smirked. She then stared at me a little, so thinking she expected me to say something, I said \"there's like 7 grams of sugar per bite.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I meant this jokingly since I thought she was in a good mood, but she promptly said she didn't want to eat it anymore, chucked it into the trash, and stormed out of the living room to her room. My sister had struggled in the past with her image and thinking she weighed a lot, so obviously this struck a nerve. I was initially upset since I didn't intend it to be an insult at all, just a joking comment, but after reflecting on it, I realized that I was in the wrong there since I am still responsible for what I say in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "I planned to try and civilly discuss the matter with her. My goal was to apologize as well as ask her to make an effort to talk conflicts like this out in the future, as I believed she'd overreacted by locked herself in her room for over 2 hours. When I did come to talk, she said to leave her alone. I told her dinner would be done in 15 minutes as well, and she yelled to leave her alone again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was annoyed but left her alone and ate dinner with my mom. An hour later, my sister comes down, still upset, and acts like nothing happened. I went with it and acted normal so that she'd hopefully calm down and be willing to talk. Eventually my mom asks her to talk with me and she refuses. I dropped the conflict for the rest of the day at this point. I believed this conflict was bad, but not worthy of this reaction, and could have been settled with less anger on both of our sides if she'd just communicate civilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, I left home and came back in the afternoon. As soon as I came back, my sister stops me and tells me that she's an adult and can put whatever she can in her body, as well as telling me how awful it is to shame people like that. I apologized by saying that I understood what I did was wrong and am definitely at fault. Then I asked she could work on her communication though, since I thought her refusing to talk for over 3 hours was overkill . She immediately scoffed and said 3 hours is nothing, and that she was considering doing this for a few months, so I was lucky. Then she promptly turned back to the show she was watching. I was in disbelief, so I stepped back to think things through.\n",

      "Body text: My mom paints for fun and has two of those wooden easels, a big one and a small one, the big one she almost never uses. Two years ago I borrowed the big one because I needed it for a group activity with friends. Well today I got a text from my mom asking me where that easel is.

If it is super apparent that I lost it, of course I would buy a new one, but she hasn’t needed it in two years so there is no way of knowing if it is really my fault that it is lost.

      "So I (29F) am dating my boyfriend (28M). We have known each other for over a decade. We met in college when I was about 18. We quickly felt connected and dated for about 8 months in college. We broke up mutually and I will be honest, we both cheated. I was stupid and wasn't feeling fulfilled. He hooked up with his ex. We both didnt know about this until a few months after we broke up. We broke up during the summer and we're still chill with each other, I asked him where he was living this coming year and he said he was living in the same apartment complex that I was. I told him that and asked what room number he was and it turns out he was the room across from me. This was wild. I was trying to get over him and here he is living across from me. We were really cool about it and actually became better friends then we were before. Visiting each other all of the time. Playing chess games. Smoking weed. We were closer than we had ever been. All was awesome. We had considered briefly being in an open relationship but one drunken night on his end he confessed that he wanted to be exclusive. I couldn't take him seriously because he was so drunk and told him so and after that we remained best friends. Once we graduated we grew apart and I had my multiple relationships as did he.\n",

      "Fast forward many years, he reached out to me, and we were both single. I had been in many toxic relationships since and he had been in one with a much younger female. I just wanted to reconnect with him because I missed him so much, so he came out to visit with me at my parents house where I have been staying. It was great. It was like we picked up where we left off and I really fell back into my feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months later he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said yes. Things were going great for a while, we talked on the phone all the time. Things felt like they used too. We had many visits with each other but this last visit gave me some doubts.\n",

He doesn't try to satisfy me and when I ask  him to he says that he is tired. And when he can't finish, I ask him to please me in other ways but he refuses. Like it is all about himself. There have been other concerns too, like he never asks me how my day is going, or what I am up to, it seems that I am the only one initiating conversation and when I finally brought it up to him ..  he broke.\n",

      "He got all quiet and basically said that I'm too good for him. And that made me mad. Like after all of this time you don't even want to try to understand my feeling? He always does this. Runs away from confrontation. And when I told him this he basically said that he thinks he is a sociopath or psychopath. He is scared of himself and doesn't want to hurt me. I have dated people like this in the past and they never admitted to it. I know that he is selfish but I feel like If he has these mental issues he wouldnt be so open to admit it. Idk if it's such a wide spectrum but in my experience people with these issues don't just outright admit it. Is he trying to get rid of me or protect me? Either way I'm very distraught because i really love him. What do I do?\n",

      "Body text: This happened over ten years ago, but I still can’t stop replaying it in my mind. I know that sounds dramatic—maybe even obsessive—but it left a scar that won’t heal, and the worst part is, the person I feel most angry with doesn’t even know it. Or if she does, she’s chosen to ignore it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt (let’s call her Jessica) was always one of the more glamorous people in my family. Think trendy outfits, brunch with mimosas, Pinterest wedding board before it was cool. She was the type of woman who seemed to shine in any room she entered. When she asked me to be a bridesmaid, I was both flattered and intimidated—I didn’t feel like I *fit* into her curated vision. I was younger, a bit awkward, and frankly struggling with my mental health at the time, but I said yes. I wanted to belong. I thought maybe, just maybe, this could be a bonding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dress fitting was in this upscale boutique in a gentrified part of town. Everything was cream-colored, sleek, and reeked of “money.” There were six of us there—Jessica, her maid of honor, two other bridesmaids, her mom, and me. I remember feeling out of place. The dresses were beautiful, but the vibe was tense—Jessica was stressed, snapping at people, clearly overwhelmed. I didn’t feel comfortable, but I told myself to suck it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, everything shifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were all in the middle of a fitting—me standing half-dressed in a changing room—a man burst into the boutique. Masked. Armed. Yelling. It was fast. Disorienting. He took phones, wallets, and even someone’s engagement ring. I still remember how he screamed at the cashier when she fumbled to open the register. He waved the gun at someone’s face. I remember freezing. I didn’t know if I was going to die, standing there in my bra with a chiffon dress halfway zipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual robbery was probably less than five minutes, but it felt like a lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was over and the man was gone, I expected panic, tears, hugs. But what happened instead was... silence. Everyone just kind of stood there. The boutique owner locked the door and called the police. Jessica complained that this would throw off her entire schedule and probably delay the alterations. No one—*not one single person*—asked if I was okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt so small. So exposed. So insignificant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding still happened a few months later. I went, smiled for photos, gave a toast. And all the while, I was shaking inside. I wanted her to say, “Hey, that was scary. Are you okay? Do you need to talk about it?” But she never did. She never brought it up again. It was like the whole thing had been an inconvenient smudge on her bridal narrative that she wanted to edit out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve never been able to let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, I distanced myself. I stopped going to family gatherings. When Jessica reached out, I responded politely but distantly. She noticed eventually and asked if she’d done something wrong. I didn’t have the words to say what I was feeling then. I didn’t even fully understand it myself. How do you say, “I blame you for not protecting me from something you couldn’t have predicted—but more than that, for not *seeing* me afterward”?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast-forward to recently: I skipped her daughter’s birthday. She called me and said I was being selfish, that family shows up for family. Something in me snapped. I told her I never felt like family to her. That I never forgave her for what happened at that dress fitting. She got quiet. Then defensive. She said, “You can’t seriously be blaming me for a robbery.”\n",

      "Body text: Hello. I'm 23f, my partner is 26m, we've been together for nearly 1.5 years. We do not live together and don't share our finances. Before I met him, he went to rehab for his video game addiction and he was clean when I met him and during the first year of our relationship. A few months ago, he relapsed. He then asked me to go into his steam account and change the password so he wouldn't have easy access to his video games anymore. This was entirely his idea and I agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has now full on relapsed, gaming for hours every day. He created a new Steam account for that. He has realized that he starts spending way too much money on his games, money that he doesn't have (He is currently unable to work due to his addiction as well as other mental health issues). So he has asked me to give him his old steam account back, because he has a lot of games on there already. I refused. After that he got really angry with me and told me he won't come to my birthday, which is next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to enable his addiction. After all if I gave him access to the account it would have the same effect as if I would buy him video games, which would be enabling imo. In my opinion, it's important to face the negative consequences of addiction in order to find motivation to recover again (I'm a recovering alcoholic myself, so I have a bit of experience with addiction, just not with gaming addiction. I also get why he's angry, I also used to become incredibly angry if I felt someone wanted to take my alcohol away from me).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand it is his account that he put a lot of money in, so I feel like it's not my right to keep it from him? I also think I should be giving him the account back because I'm scared his anger will just push him further away from me and deeper into his addiction. Before this fight we had a really good relationship going during the last few weeks. I stopped trying to control him, he started trusting me more and opening up more about his addiction, and he made the decision to spend time with me instead of gaming at least two times a week. I feel like I'm ruining that right now and I'm scared he might even break up with me over that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth mentioning that he's planning to go to rehab again and he just started therapy specifically for media addiction, which I think is great. He also mentioned that he won't even try to stop gaming until rehab starts though, because he thinks that he won't be able to stay clean anyways. I do not personally agree with this decision, but as I said, I don't want to tell him what to do anymore and I am trying to respect his decision.\n",

      "Body text: I (13M,) of course, have a mother and father. However, I've noticed that every time you say something in general (even if it's about the littlest thing,) my mom will say something like, \"Why are you being so nasty?!\" Well, just yesterday, when my mom picked me up from school, I told her about a new club I wanted to try out for, when all of a sudden, out of the blue, she just said, \"Ok, why are you being so loud?\" I spoke at an average volume, mind you. I simply told her that I wasn't trying to be loud, but she just started an argument with me, so I argued with her back. The argument went on for a good five minutes before we arrived home, when she called me an asshole. That name triggered me, so I just crashed out at her, to keep things brief. But now I just feel guilty about it. I shouldn't be arguing with her. She's just my mom. So, was she right? AITA?\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "I’ve been friends with E since we were 4, and we’re now in grade 9. We’ve never fought before, but lately that’s changed. We’re in the same geography class, and so is J, a popular girl who acts nice but constantly makes rude comments. She says things like “you’re literally so fat, but we love a queen who accepts her body” or “you look really sick today.” She’s never been nice to me or my friends—except for E, who’s close with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, J has started targeting me. She interrupts my conversations with my friends, then accuses me of eavesdropping when I speak. I felt like I couldn’t even talk to my own friends in class. After school, I talked to E and M (who are also in the class) about how J was being mean. Instead of supporting me, E said I was talking behind J’s back. I disagreed—venting about someone bullying you isn’t gossip. Then I found out E told J what I said. That crossed a line. I wasn’t gossiping; I was just expressing how J made me feel. After that, J’s behavior got worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a group project where I partnered with E, and J inserted herself into our group. I told E I was uncomfortable because of the bullying—J’s been making mean comments about my weight and appearance, and I’ve overheard her talking about me in class. E brushed it off. During the project, I mentioned being hungry after walking 4 km, and J said, “yeah, I can TELL you ate this morning. You’ll live.” E laughed—even though she knows I’ve struggled with body image and EDs. J did no work on the project, and I kept trying to talk to E about how hurtful it was, but she called me dramatic and said J was a good person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, before class started, I joked that my friend T won an arm wrestle against J. J turned to me and yelled, “shut up, you stupid b*tch, nobody asked you.” F (T’s boyfriend) defended me, and J snapped at him, saying “are you in love with her or something?” in front of his girlfriend. My teacher walked in before I could respond. Since then, J hasn’t spoken to me, but she’s been telling others I’m annoying just for talking to my own friends. If she’s talking about me, how is that different from what I did?\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I haven’t been rude to her once, but every time I try to speak to her or include her, she’s rude to me. I just want E to recognize how badly J treats people, including me. E has admitted J can be mean, but she still chooses to get closer to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, I realized why J is really mad at me. I’ve liked this guy C since grade 7, and he liked me too. Nothing happened between us, but we used to flirt. Recently, I saw J and C flirting and heard she liked him. I told E, “i saw J and C in class today, she looks like she likes him lol” I didn’t think it was a big deal, just something I noticed. E told J I said that, and now I’m “spreading rumors.” I said what I saw, to one person I trusted, and now I like to gossip. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m honestly done with J at this point. And E too, if she keeps acting like this is all my fault.\n",

      "Body text: My coworker is slightly overweight. Just a few pounds chubby. Not exactly fat but you can tell she’s not really a gym person. She told me that she doesn’t really workout that much. When all of a sudden one day she told me shes going to run a 10k which is 6 miles. I didn’t really believe her so I just nodded. I just smiled and said good luck with that. Considering that she told me she doesn’t workout, running a 10k without training sounded like a lie. Well the next week, she actually ran it. She showed me a picture of her time and how long she ran it. She averaged 10 minutes per mile and she told me she never stopped. As someone who only ever ran a 5k, I was really surprised that she did that. I have trouble running a 9 minute mile consistently for a 5k. I told her I’m very impressed and I didn’t think she had it in her. She sounded offended, and she asked if I was calling her fat. I said no but said I didn’t expect her to run it. Then she told me she’ll continue running to not be fat. Am I the asshole? \n",

      "Title: AITA for exposing my friend’s lie to his ex gf?\n",
      "Body text: I’m a 43yo woman who has a 41yo male friend we’ll call Mike. I met Mike around Xmas last year and we felt some pretty strong feelings for each other but suffered from bad timing and a big case of essentially nerves. I only mention this to see if folks think it’s relevant. Shortly thereafter Mike met a girl and began dating her. She didn’t want him having female friends and he was desperate to have a relationship as he has low self esteem and social awkwardness. I wasn’t happy but bowed out. A few months later, Mike shows up because his gf and he broke up and he was devastated. I tend to have pretty extreme empathy- I have the unfortunate ability to feel what other people feel for whatever reason and the pain was eating him alive. I kind of threw myself into caring for him as did my family ( ugh I suppose rn is where I mention that I am polyamorous and have three partners- I know how much judgement there is in here. )We wanted to let him crash with us awhile to get on his feet and I wanted to offer him some unconditional love and nurturing as he had a horrific childhood and has a hard time functioning. We didn’t date because he decided poly wasn’t his thing. After a couple of months of me trying everything I could to make him feel loved and supported, I hadn’t made a ton of progress. He was casually dating because he can’t stand to not have a partner but he felt very little for these women. He promised me he was being ethical and honest with them. It’s relevant that I have a moral compass and set of ethics that I adhere to extremely strictly. I don’t generally deal with people who treat others poorly. Yesterday he wanted to harm himself and I rushed to his side, dropping everything. I held him as he cried all day and lamented that he couldn’t get his stuff back from his ex as she had blocked him and he just wanted it done and over with. The way he spoke it seemed as though there were items of value to retrieve. I had suggested a couple courses of action earlier, first that I come with him for moral support and to keep things civil. When he said that wouldn’t work, I offered to be his legal representation ( not lawyer as I’m not one and that would be illegal) and I would explain that I was mediating the exchange of possessions so as not to need the police. I’ve acted as legal proxy and stand in in court for friends before and have training in the matter. He agreed to this solution late at night and asked if we could get it done now as he knew she would be home and awake. I agreed because he seemed to think this would bring him peace and he’d not want to harm himself. As I was gussying up to look professional- he told me that he didn’t want me using my real name because he didn’t want her to know it was me- the person she didn’t want around at the beginning of their relationship. I didn’t want to and compromised by using my middle name and mother’s maiden name which are legally mine to use. He spoke of wanting closure and having a little hope but it was vague and I assumed he meant that the stuff exchange would bring the closure. I asked him how long we’d be and he said just in and out, she didn’t want to talk. I was exhausted so I just grabbed my phone and clipboard for any notes and left everything else at his place. We took his car. We got in the apartment building by the grace of a kind resident and knocked on her door. When she didn’t answer I announced who I was and my purpose. I could hear her moving around so I said I would leave her a note explaining the next steps and that we didn’t want the police to have to step in. She opened the door then and I asked if she’d help me out and make this easy so she wouldn’t have to deal with him again. She then got his stuff which consisted of pillowcases, tshirts and soap dispensers (not the important stuff I’d thought we’d be getting). Mike then ‘dismissed’me to wait in the lobby as he was talking to her. I went and realized that his stuff was meaningless and he used me to lure her out so he could talk to her when she didn’t want to talk to him. Angry at him and also mostly at myself, I decided to not participate any further and did go to the lobby, kicking myself for being gullible and planning a talk with him for after . I sat for a bit and got a ‘we’re talking hang tight’ text from him. After half an hour it hit me that I hadn’t eaten anything for twelve hours nor drank any water really. I had also not taken my blood pressure pills- I had recently been diagnosed with hypertension and was still getting used to the regimen. I began to feel terrible but chalked it up to anxiety that I get from my ptsd. After another twenty minutes or so (I think), I began sweating buckets. I went outside to circle the block a few times and cool off. I began to be dizzy, lightheaded, headachy, heart pounding and my chest hurt and my face was losing sensation. I scrambled around looking in my pockets and discovered I didn’t have any medicine nor any money on me and I also didn’t know the address where I was. I became disoriented and texted Mike, I texted him several times with no answer. I called one of my partners to come for me but he was half an hour away and I didn’t know where I was. I called Mike several times to no avail and I began to panic, thinking he’d abandoned me and I couldn’t get to my pills or money. I went back to the building and managed to get in. I sat and tried to think but my cognition was impaired. I texted Mike again. Finally I made it to the elevator to go up and somehow find out where I was without blowing his cover. I made it up and he was cuddling with his ex by the elevator. She saw me  and her obvious concern washed over me. He however, looked panicked and kept saying ‘ok thank you’, thank you very much ‘ like he was dismissing hired help. I was gasping trying to make eye contact with him to indicate my distress but he kept shooing me. By then I was fading, I was going to pass out and I had a feeling of doom. I thought I was going to die. I needed to be taken seriously for one and for two, if I was leaving this world, my first thought was to not let this poor woman be lied to so I blurted out who I really was and that I had deceived her. She got up and left and he followed her. I collapsed in the elevator and crawled out to a chair in the lobby and called an ambulance. I was hardly coherent and could not find an address anywhere so I patched my partner in so he could trace my phone with the find my phone app. As I was crying and drenched with sweat Mike came down furious. When he realized I was in distress and might be having a heart attack- he found the address for me but tried to see if he could drive me instead. As he was talking with the dispatcher, I stumbled out of the building and passed out. Next thing I know, my partner was there as was the ambulance and my blood pressure was clocking at 197/150 and my heart rate at like 135 or something. My partner was chewing Mike out for not answering my texts and calls - Mike was saying that if he had, his ex would have seen my name and the cover would have been blown and how was he supposed to know something was wrong. I thought my partner was going to slug him as he sputtered out that several calls and texts in immediate succession was a sign something was wrong! Mike said he thought I was just impatient. By now the EMTs had done more tests and my blood pressure lowered a bit and my EKG came back saying no heart attack. Theyexplained I likely had a hypertension attack which I didn’t know was a thing and they told me we had to go to the hospital because another one could cause a heart attack. I refused because Mike was upset and still hadn’t told me he wasn’t going to harm himself so I couldn’t leave him. They let me sign a waiver and we went to get my things from Mike’s. I was sobbing saying I was sorry but I had to do the right thing, I had a split second to think and I had to do the right thing by telling her the truth. I had gotten her to leave her apartment under false pretenses and I had to undo the situation I created. Mike was bitterly angry but holding it back saying he’d check on me in the morning but that there had to be something else I could have done other than tell who I really was. I had doctors appointments scheduled early so I left, eliciting a promise that he wouldn’t hurt himself. Today he texted to ask how I was doing and then laid into me that I had betrayed him, that clearly my illness wasn’t that bad if the ambulance let me go (they legally can’t keep me) and why couldn’t I think of something else, why didn’t I anticipate that he would take a long time and bring what I needed, I was clearly only friends with him to sabotage his dating life and why if I thought I was going to die did I not think of his predicament instead of doing the ethical thing that would make me feel better. I was shocked as I found this callous as did my family. He came over to talk in person to see if he could forgive me. He softened somewhat on seeing me but still felt I betrayed him and he said everyone he spoke to agreed with him (turned out to be the 2 girls he was dating). He said that he had no idea that I could get sick. I know I told him I had hypertension, he saw me not eat or drink. Something else I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want to put the focus on me was that I’d had a miscarriage very recently and though it was very very early stages, I’m still bleeding it out some as the doctor said I would likely be ok that way and I was to go to the hospital if it got worse. I told him this when he said that if it were him, he’d have just sucked it up and dealt with the attack and not do what I did. The knowledge of the miscarriage did not move him. My family laid into him pretty good and he said we’d talk tomorrow. I don’t know that I will talk with him. I don’t think I’m wrong but he’s so sure and so adamant that I feel like I’m losing my mind. I also hate giving up on people and I know that I could be seeing things wildly differently than him. Was I wrong?\n",

      "Body text: Hi. I (15FTM) and my mom (45F) have a pretty toxic relationship. I was misdiagnosed with a different disorder (Oppositional Defiant Disorder or ODD) at five years old, which considerably messed up the way people not only saw me, but also treated me. Since ODD is a behavioral disorder, people just saw me as some spoiled brat who was being disrespectful just because. Last year, (nine years after my original diagnosis) I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism. My mom wasn't too surprised since she had suspected I was on the spectrum before. My dad (39M) on the other hand, doesn't believe I have it and is dead set on denying the fact that I am disabled. (This detail comes into play later). I had a pair of noise canceling headphones that worked really well for me and helped me a lot with getting overstimulated and/or having meltdowns. Unfortunately for me, the week they came in the mail, I took them to a cousin's house, which we barely see once or twice a year. My world seemed like it was ending at the time, but I found a quick replacement while I waited for a chance to ask for them back. Six months passed and I was able to get them back. To my surprise however, my cousin (who is my age) had been very clearly using MY headphones during this time. The pads were peeled and ripping, they had scratches all over them, the sound quality had worsened and so had the battery and the buttons were faded. About two months after I got them back, they gave out and I had to throw them away. I have been BEGGING my mom since December of last year to get me a new pair and she keeps saying no. She knows it helps me a significant amount but she just won't budge. Or at least until a few weeks ago. Finals week. I had been bothering her so much about the headphones at the time that she just blurted out that if I passed all my finals, she would get me the headphones. Out of excitement that she would even consider buying another pair for me I said yes, which was a stupid idea. Today, I was looking through an online store that sold a pair at 17USD. Which is a really good deal. So I asked her about it and she refused. She said we had a deal and that I either wait for the test results or she just wouldn't get me the headphones. She gave me the another option, which was to ask my dad. Like I mentioned beforw, my dad doesn't believe autism is a disability or that I even have autism, so it would be pointless to ask anyway. He's also in a bad financial situation, gets paid less than my mom and doesn't have insurance. I reminded her of all of this and she just said \"I'm not buying them unless you pass your finals, end of conversation.\" I have never been the type to steal from anyone, much less from family, but like I said to my mom, this isn't out of luxury, it's a support tool that shouldn't be placed behind a condition.\n",

      "\n",
      "almost a year ago, i fell absolutely head over heels for my ex boyfriend (m16) who we’ll call connor. connor’s younger brother, who we’ll call jason (m15). noah and jason are BEST friends. like. jason practically lives here in the summer when noah is allowed to have long sleepovers. they play hockey together. connor also plays hockey, and we met briefly a few times before but started going out in august of 2024. connor is also friends with noah. long story short, connor had a lot going on with sports (hockey and baseball) and school. we stopped hanging out as much and he eventually broke up with me (like a week before valentine’s day but i’m not going to be petty about that here) because he felt he wasn’t giving me the time and attention i deserved. i was so upset. we ended on good terms, but i’m not going to sit here and say i’m not hurt because i’m not even sure i’m actually over him yet. \n",

      "\n",
      "he told me that i needed to go find somewhere else to spend the weekend because he was going to have this sleepover no matter what and my mom told him he could only do it if i went to a friend’s house for the weekend or something. most people would think that’s a great deal and take it, but i HATE sleepovers. i have a lot of anxiety surrounding them and i just don’t like not being able to spend the night in my own house. i was also going to get some things done this weekend. i told him i absolutely would not be leaving and he would have to figure something out and he was PISSED. \n",

      "\n",
      "i want to make an edit to clarify something. the four of them can have a sleepover at anyone else's house, my brother just wants it to be here because he doesn't want to pack. our house is pretty small and they're all very destructive together, and that's part of the reason i don't want to stay home and \"mind my business\". my room is right next to noah's and they stay up all night screaming and yelling and messing around. i am not preventing them from ever seeing each other again, i just don't want it to happen here. i feel very violated by my brother demanding i go somewhere else even though i don't really have anywhere else to go. we have a lot of family here, so we are planning on visiting often. my parents are very close with conner's parents and said that noah could go spend a couple weeks at their house this summer. this is not a forever goodbye that i am interrupting, it would just be the last sleepover before we leave.\n",

      "Body text: I (39F) live in Oshawa, Ontario with my husband and our 12-year-old daughter “L.” L has always struggled with making friends. She’s shy and has a hard time connecting with kids her age. It’s been heartbreaking at times, and we’ve always tried to encourage her and help her build confidence.\n",

      "A few months ago, L finally made a new friend at school—we’ll call her “A.” A is Indian, and I was genuinely relieved at first to see L bonding with someone.

I just didn’t want her picking up an accent or behavior that might cause issues later on, especially since she’s already had trouble fitting in.\n",

      "My wife (36f) and I (39m) have a 4 month old son, in addition to a 2 year old daughter. I'm currently on paternity leave and am his primary caretaker. I do all of his feedings at night and tend to him throughout the day while my wife works from home. He hasn't been sleeping very well lately and is sometimes extremely fussy throughout the night. For whatever reason, I'm having an extremely tough time being his primary source of care and it's beginning to take a toll on my mental health. It's nearly impossible to get anything done during the day, such as showering, cleaning, and chores, because he is very needy and I'm always super tired. As a result, I've begun to look into temporary assistance from a nanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife, however, is completely against this idea. From her perspective, I need to suck it up and take charge of the situation. She had 3 months of maternity leave and was his primary caregiver during 2 of those months, so she thinks that if she can do it, I should be able to as well. I've explained to her that I'm not cut out for this and I'm having a very difficult time, but she won't listen. She looks at me like I'm crazy when I suggest getting help and says it's ridiculous. She also says it's a waste of money, but I'm the primary breadwinner and have the budget for this. There are no immediate needs that would be hindered by paying for a nanny. Frankly, I'm surprised at her lack of sympathy for something that I feel like I desperately need. She has offered to jump in and help if I'm having trouble, but her schedule is unpredictable and I'd rather have someone dedicated 3-4 hours a day so I can get some rest and get chores done.\n",

      "I (23M) have been married to my wife (24F) for a couple of months now and we’ve been together for 7. I met my wife in high school and we’ve been together since. We’ve been in a pretty good relationship since then, with issues solved pretty quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue at hand is: my wife usually plans stuff and I go along with it with no issue. However, every once in a while, she asks me to plan something, and it doesn’t go well. I do know the things my wife likes, however, the plan is always really simple, but more importantly, unorganized. My wife doesn’t like this and has expressed her frustration about it, but I feel like I can never get it right so essentially, I stopped trying and just let her do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, my wife just graduated with her bachelors degree and the past month has really been hard on her. Between moving out of her college apartment, the death of someone close to her, spraining her ankle during the move, and the general feeling of “what now” that people feel post-graduation, she’s been feeling down and has expressed wanting to do something exciting. She asked me for my opinion, since we would both be doing it, and I said I didn’t really care. Then after some back and forth, I admitted basically since I’m bad at planning, I just kinda let her do whatever rather than attempt to learn how to plan, and that made her angry. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried explaining it’s because of college and work, I just never really felt the need to learn how to plan stuff, but shes saying that I had resources to plan stuff, which is true, she constantly sends me stuff of cool places to go, but she said that I don’t put any effort into learning and my statements affirmed to her that she isn’t worth learning stuff for. \n",
      "\n",
      "She called me an asshole and she’s being really short and detached. Although it doesn’t seem like I’m remorseful, I want to fix things, but I just feel like we’ve been doing things the same way for so long.\n",

      "Title: AITA for not driving my daughter and getting mad she was late?\n",
      "Body text: My daughter (17) has played an elite competitive sport all through high school. She plays on the school team during the school season and on a club team the rest of the time. She plays year round and has done so since she was 14. Her mom and I are divorced and she spends one week with me and one with her mom, switching on Sundays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sport takes up whole weekends the majority of the year, so she ends up playing Friday-Sunday/Monday( if it's a holiday weekend) which means I miss a lot of time with her because she is playing her sport on a day that should be mine. Her mom pays for the sport 100 percent and I allow her to play, this was the agreement we had. The program costs $6500 a year plus travel. My ex wife says she spent about $12,000 on just the travel this year. Probably not, I think she said that just to see if I would help pay for it, which I didn't. She and/or her mom do all the transportation to games and tournaments. I don't go because that's not how I prefer to spend my weekends.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now the story. The last tournament of the year was this past weekend from Saturday to Monday since Monday was a holiday. Last week was my daughter's week with her mom which means she should have transitioned to me on Sunday, but they were \"out of town\" for the tournament. They were in the same area as we live in, about 30 miles away, but since the tournament was held downtown in a major US city on a holiday weekend, my ex wife opted to stay in a hotel rather than drive up and down every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday my ex wife texted me to ask if I wanted to pick up my daughter at the hotel on Sunday since it was my day, and then bring her to the tournament on Monday (also my holiday this year). I said I didn't want to do that and that my daughter could just drive to my house after they got home from the tournament. My ex wife said ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well on Monday my wife was busy with her family so I decided to drive up and watch my daughter play. My ex wife asked if I was going to take our daughter home, since it was my day. She said I could take her to her house and then my daughter could grab her car and come over. I said no, my daughter could just come over after she got home, and I left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my daughter didn't come over for 2 hours! I texted my daughter but she didn't respond so I texted my ex wife and demanded to know why my daughter hadn't come home yet. My ex wife responded that she was probably napping and would be there soon. I told her that I expected my daughter in the next 5 minutes because that's how long it takes to drive between houses. She finally got there about 15 minutes later. I again texted my ex that this was unacceptable. My ex wife said that she offered me the chance to drive my daughter and I refused, so she asked why I was being such an ass then. I told her it was because she had made our daughter late and cut into my time. That was the last I heard from my ex yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess I'm wondering if she is right and I am an ass?\n",

      "\n",
      "it turned into a much larger argument and i admit, i got angry and accused him of having a weight gain fetish that he secretly indulged in by not commenting on Cs weight. looking back, it wasnt very logical, but i already apologized and my bf is still upset about it. he thinks that i was by proxy accusing him of not trusting me and being sick enough to get off to someone without their consent. \"is that the type of person you think i am?\" and all of that. that wasnt what i was thinking when i said it and i tried explaining that to him but he wont listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "however, i do still think that hes enabling C. maybe not consciously, but its still happening. i dont know is C knows we had that argument or not, if he does; i hope its a wakeup call for him to get on track. i feel like an asshole about how i went about saying it to my bf, but all of my other friends say that im not an asshole and that he just needs to reflect on his behavior. so, i need to find a general opinion from something unbiased: aita?\n",

      "\n",
      "So in short I didn’t end up going to the wedding. Katie and Chris basically harassed me constantly until few days before they were due to fly out I received a belligerent voicemail from Katie saying if I didn’t go I wasn’t her sister any more, I was embarrassing myself and her and Chris, I was a horrible person, and most shockingly if I didn’t go then her and Chris wouldn’t be paying me OR my parents back for the money we loaned (so trying to. blackmail me), she would say it was a gift, I faked the contract and I would have to take her to court. She was clearly drunk at the time (the voicemail was left on the night she was having her “at home” hen do, which I also obviously didn’t attend) but it was so beyond anything I thought she was capable of. I ended up sharing it with my parents and they also reluctantly pulled out of attending. \n",

      "As I mentioned in my post I had my brother in law (solicitor) draw up a contract for repayment for both myself and my parents. What was supposed to be the first repayment date passed without word from either of them, so BIL picked up from there. His attempts to reach them were ignored apart from 1 email from what I think was a fake law firm outlining the money was “gifted”, the contract was fraudulent and to take them to court basically. In response to that BIL sent a copy of the voicemail Katie left and a final demand outlining the payment plan was now null and void and we wanted the money in full within 30 days or we would indeed be going to court. Magically the full amount appeared in our accounts 5 days later. \n",

A few months before the cabin trip, he brought Frank home to meet them for the first time, and his parents made them sleep in separate rooms. Ed said his folks implied that he and Frank would be kicked out if they didn't. He said that when I refused to let them use the master bedroom, it brought up those bad feelings, and he misdirected his anger at me.\n",

So I am home alone at my parent's place dog sitting and I get back from walking the dog and as soon as I close the door and lock it, I hear the ring cam doorbell go off and knocking and I can see through their Alexa that it's two kids. Probably middle school aged. They have a bike and scooter. I did not see them when I came back from the walk, so I don't know where they were waiting or where they even came from.\n",

Just leave it in the mailbox. I cannot open the door right now because my dog is not friendly\". Which is, true, but also like, I have no idea if this is a scheme or if there's an adult in a car waiting for them, etc. My mind is going into all sorts of scenarios that could end horribly for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "After them standing there for like five minutes, I can see through the cam that they put it in the mailbox and walk slowly away on their bike/scooter. About two minutes later, one of the kids comes back and puts his hood on. Rings the doorbell and I can see him put his hood on and I say \"what's up?\" through the ring cam. And he says \"My friend wants a reward\". And I say \"thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave\". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say \"I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops\". The kid then says \"call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*. If I ever find something for your house again, I'm not returning it\". He then walks away before giving me the finger.\n",

I didn't feel unsafe about the boys themselves, more annoyance because it was stressing the dog out (although them standing there for a while made me think someone might have been coercing them to stay there until someone answered the door, but that might just be my anxiety). I was also extremely stressed about the reactive dog and that played a big factor into me not wanting to open the door when I could accomplish what needed to be said (a thank you and leaving in the mailbox is fine) through the ring doorbell. I also felt kinda weirded out when one boy came back and not the other. I mentioned my age and size because you'd be surprised at how people assume you are naive when you're a) young and b) a woman and c) know that you might be home alone. \n",

      "Title: AITA for not claiming my friends mistake on my insurance\n",
      "Body text: Hi! I (26F) and my friend from college (26F) both moved into the same apartment building. She lives on the floor above mine. One weekend she put me along with a bunch of our mutual friends in a group chat because she wanted to have a barbecue on our roof. She has hosted many before, but this would be the first one I ever attended. Because I don’t eat red meat I did not eat anything that was cooked on the grill and only brought chips a bottle and paper plates. When the day was over, the group of us went downstairs to watch a reality show. My friend who lives in my building and the girl who owned the grill discussed that they would leave the grill to cool off. Once the reality show it was over, I went back to my apartment and went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day everyone in my building receives an email saying that there was a fire on the roof last night because someone dumped coals in the trashcan on the roof and they re-lit due to the wind. I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to my friend who then put it in the group chat of everyone. her and our other friend, who owned the grill, told us that they decided to take the grill home the same day because they didn’t wanna have to come back and get it the next day. So the girl in my building gave the grill owner her keys to go get the grill on the roof and the grill owner decided that it would be the best thing to just toss the coals into the trashcan on the roof. Our building requires multiple key taps to get on and off the roof and they also have cameras so they immediately told  my friend in my building she was responsible since it was her guest using her keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, my friend came to me and asked me to put it on my insurance since she nor the grill owner, had renters insurance. I spoke with a few lawyers and my old insurance agent, and they all said that this would be fraud. So I told my friend I did not feel comfortable doing so. Another week goes by and she asked me again because she believed that she would have to go bankrupt over the situation (she did not). I again said no because I did not feel comfortable and reiterated that I was told that this would be fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "From then, she started to run a smear campaign, saying that I was the bad friend and all of our friend group stop talking to me because they said that I should’ve at least tried to put it on my insurance. They now all want me to apologize to all of them and work for their friendship again since they believe that I was in the wrong but I feel like I didn’t do any wrong. So WITA?\n",

      "Body text: My friend Rachel’s 30th birthday was this past weekend. (Obviously not her real name, haha) We’ve been friends since college and work in the same industry (a boring one, lol) so we’ve stayed close. I helped with some of the logistics but was not a host or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel has always been into fandom stuff, always has shows she’s watching, fanfiction she’s writing or reading, fan theories and fan projects. I am not much of a fandom person. When I watch shows, I don’t get very invested or engage with fan theories. I also don’t tend to like shows where there’s a big fan following. From what I can tell, it’s mostly stuff that’s like fantasy, science fiction, or paranormal that happens. Forums for shows I like tend to all be “This character is over hater” or “X is a bad person” The closest I’ve come to anything like that is watching a few episodes of Star Trek with my dad as a kid. I usually like real life dramas or fun light-hearted shows like Sex and the City or Friends. (I know the “cool” thing these days is to make a big show about how you don’t find Friends funny, and truthfully I haven’t seen an episode of it in years, it’s just an example.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For her birthday she asked everyone to show up in cosplay from your favorite series. I will say most of our social group is similar to her in that they like this sort of thing. I’m one of the few odd ducks out. I tried to think of something I could dress up as, I saw some Tiktok of a girl showing off her Phoebe Buffay inspired outfits, and I had a few similar things in my closet, so I went with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I showed up, Rachel greeted me and then asked me what I was dressed as because she didn’t recognize it. I told her. She didn’t know the name, I explained, and she made a funny face and said “I guess that kind of counts?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t think about it again until later in the evening when Rachel was talking to everyone and thanked them for coming and saying she’d had fun talking about the cosplay costumes with everyone and how everyone did such a good job, “Except Jessica… but it’s okay, you definitely might have tried!” It’s not like everyone laughed or anything but it was so awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up leaving a little while later because it just felt… off. A couple of days later, Rachel and I were texting and she said “Btw next time I’ll help you pick so you aren’t embarrassed.” I feel like she’s implying that I SHOULD be embarrassed.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "My best friend of 12 years and I just had a situation that really hurt me. She’s been staying at my house with my family for the past month—this isn’t the first time she’s stayed long-term. We treat her like family, and I’ve always said I view my close friends as chosen family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, we went on a trip to Miami. On the last day, we were tired and rushing to pack. I had borrowed a pair of her sneakers (she told me not to pack more sneakers cause I can borrow hers), I packed my heels and purses that we planned to share. I assumed I’d be wearing the sneakers I used for the airport to leave to come back home. That morning, she decided to wear them instead—which is totally fine, duh, they’re hers. She offered me another pair, but I didn’t want to wear those. I noticed another pair outside her suitcase and asked if I could wear them. She danced around the question, beat around the bush, I then said “you don’t want me to wear these right?” She said no. I responded, “Just say that then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll admit my tone was frustrated. I didn’t yell or try to start anything, I know I sounded irritated. Later, we talked about it and she told me my comment felt like “fighting words.” Literal physical fighting. I explained I wasn’t trying to be hostile—I was tired and frustrated, and I apologized. It wasn’t that deep TO ME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said something that really hurt me: “I talk to my sisters like that, but we’re just friends, not family, so that’s not acceptable between us.” That stung. She’s been sleeping in my bed, helping cook for my family, sharing life with us for weeks. (Not to say because of this that I can speak to her however, I understand where she was coming from on that but her saying THIS sprouted a completely separate issue) I’ve always seen her as family, even if we’re not blood. I said, “You’re staying in my house,” and she backtracked: “Don’t get it twisted, you are family—but friends shouldn’t talk like that.” Still, the damage was done. I feel like I crossed a line once, but she dismissed the whole foundation of our bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her again that I didn’t mean it that way, that I’m not perfect, and sometimes when my patience runs thin, I slip up. I’ve had similar issues with family too. It really only happens when I reach a point and that rarely happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our talk, I also brought up that she was in a mood that morning too—short and not her usual self. I asked her to acknowledge that, but she didn’t. She didn’t apologize or reflect on her own energy at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, mid-convo, she goes, “Me and [our other friend] are going to North Carolina this weekend if you want to come—it’s an open invitation I guess.” The way she said it felt weird. After everything, that “I guess” rubbed me the wrong way.\n",

      "Body text: Thanks to everyone who commented on my original post. I really appreciated the insight, especially from those who helped me understand why this hit such a nerve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to clarify, I have no intention of cutting my parents out over this. They let me live at home rent-free during college, gave me a lot of academic support growing up (I wasn’t a naturally strong student like my brother), and have always been loving in most other ways. This situation hurt, but it doesn’t erase everything they’ve done for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother’s Day was tense. As soon as I arrived, my mom said, “I don’t want another fight to ruin today,” when I tried to bring up the money again. I left after brunch. We finally talked this past weekend. My brother said he hadn’t known about the “wedding fund” until I brought it up and felt awful it was causing tension. He’s rethinking grad school now, saying it might be smarter to get work experience first. He applied to MBA programs and jobs while finishing undergrad, graduated early in December, and got into the program he planned to attend. Now he’s planning to defer and focus on the job search instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also told me our parents had said I might help with the cost. He’d planned to pay me back but realized he wouldn’t earn anything for a few years and would still set me back. That’s part of why he reconsidered.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom wasn’t happy. She said she didn’t want him giving up an amazing opportunity just because I was “being bitter.” That really stung. I told her I wasn’t bitter, I was blindsided. I found out about the money during a conversation where I was being asked to hand over $15,000 for someone else’s future. That was painful, especially since I’d turned down opportunities because no help was available. I just wish I’d known.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s when my dad stepped in. After I was born, he started saving for what he imagined as my dream wedding. It was sentimental to him. When my brother was born, they saved a similar amount for his wedding or family expenses. Neither of us knew these funds existed. They only considered using his for school when other aid fell short. After I said no, they decided to use both funds to help him and figured they’d replenish mine later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get why it made sense to them, but it still hurt. Many commenters pointed out the situation was sexist, even if unintentionally. It’s hard not to feel like I was expected to get married while my brother was expected to succeed. I don’t think that’s what they meant, but that’s how it felt. To their credit, they listened. My dad apologized for not telling me sooner. My mom didn’t fully agree, but I think she heard me.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, she's always been like this. Every time we've seen a movie where something even slightly scary happens, she gasps super loud or screams at the top of her lungs. It's okay when we're watching movies at home because, like, it's in a private space, but when she does this at movie theaters it's so embarrassing! Especially if it's a silent scene and she's making these little gasping noises in fear of what's about to occur. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I really didn't want to see this movie (I respect the final destination franchise, but I'm not good with horror/thrillers), but she begged me to go. I said okay, we go, the movie starts blah blah blah and then a character dies and she immediately yells like she's never yelled before. I'm leaning away from her out of embarrassment and I swear the lady next to me is glaring at my mom. Well this happens again and again and again and it gets to a point, so during the next death (mri scene), I cover her mouth with my hand and let her scream into it. \n",
      "\n",
      "After she's done yelling and realizes that my hands is on her mouth, she pulls my hand off and glares at me. For the rest of the movie she stays silent and I'm like \"cool, finally\" and then we watch the rest of the movie with no other yells from her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Movie finally ends, we get out of the movie theater, into her car, and she starts yelling at me. She calls me disrespectful for putting my filthy (girl bye) hand over her mouth and that I was an a-hole. I tell her that everytime she screamed like she'd witnessed the death in front of her, I got embarrassed and people started looking at us! That she can do it at home, but not in public where other people are trying to enjoy the movie. \n",

I just wanted to add (since I saw this in a few comments earlier) that I did whisper to my mom to please be more quiet each time she had screamed prior to the hand over the mouth thingy. Additionally, I know it was wrong of me to go when I knew that she was like this, but I just thought she had changed since it had been a few years since we'd seen a horror movie together at the theaters (probably before covid). Anyways, later I'm going to apologize for what I did and gently tell her that her huge reactions are disruptive. I hope it goes well. Thanks again!\n",

      "Body text: My younger sister has struggled with body odor for years. It’s something everyone in my family has noticed, but no one addresses directly. My parents occasionally hint that she should shower or they give her new soaps. I’m not sure if she realizes it, but the odor is strong enough that her entire room smells, and my mom has to use a special detergent just to get the scent out of her clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I assumed it was a puberty phase, as she was in middle school when it started, but I just got back from college, and unfortunately, it’s still a major issue, maybe even worse. I know she deals with anxiety and depression, and it's likely this is a hygiene issue tied to her mental health. I understand that struggle and really don’t want to come across as mean or judgmental.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I’m thinking about this now is that she’s leaving for college soon and will be living in a dorm with roommates. I’m genuinely worried that people won’t be kind about it or that she’ll have a hard time socially because of the smell. I’d rather she hear it from me, someone who cares, than from a roommate or stranger in a cruel or embarrassing way. But at the same time, I don’t want to hurt her feelings or damage her self-esteem since it is already very low.\n",

      "\n",
      "To clarify a few things: my sister is currently in therapy for her mental health and is on medication, which could possibly be contributing to the odor, but this issue existed before she began treatment. The smell isn’t like typical body odor; it’s very distinct, though hard to describe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also spoke to my mom, as many of you suggested. It turns out she has addressed the issue with my sister more directly than I realized. I had brought it up with her before, but until I asked today, I didn’t know she had actually spoken to my sister about it. My mom believes the root of the issue is my sister’s depression, which often leaves her without the energy or motivation to keep up with hygiene.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, my mom encouraged me to still talk to her myself. She pointed out that I may be able to approach the topic in a different way, as a sibling rather than a parent, and that might resonate more. Since I’ve just returned from college, I can also offer some perspective on dorm life and why this might become more noticeable or impactful in that setting.\n",

      "Body text: I had a son when I was younger who turned out to have Cerebral Palsy as well as some developmental delays and needed some extra care. Back then I needed all the help I could get so my family treated my son like a community project, which was greatly appreciated at the time, but lately it’s been seeming like there are too many cooks in the kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "While my son grew up, my sister got a degree in Special Needs Education and started teaching a special needs elementary class. Over the years, my sister has been increasingly giving my wife and I more and more unsolicited advice on how to parent my son. Which is fine in theory, but instead of taking us to the side and giving us her professional opinion, she tends to actively disregard the way we want to teach my son, in front of him, and in a condescending way. For example, when my son was being rude, I corrected him and sent him to his room. My sister stepped in and said “Don’t send him to his room, he doesn’t know what he’s doing.” Another example is: Lately we’ve been trying to promote independence in him so when my son said he was thirsty, I said “So go get yourself some water”. My sister said “Oh, I’ll get it!” So I respectfully responded to her saying “Actually can he get it himself? We are trying to teach him independence.” She answered with “No, he can’t do it himself.” Our son even protested and said he wanted to do it himself, but she sternly turned him down, only to get him his water for him.\n",

      "There have been a ton of these little moments that have built up for me and my wife over time. To the point where we sat her down and had to talk boundaries with her. But it all came to a head again last Christmas when we went to visit my family. \n",
      "\n",
      "The entire trip was filled with condescending corrections from my sister. The last straw is when my son had a meltdown and he marched into his room. I said I was going to go talk to him, but she stopped me and said “No, don’t. He needs to calm down” My wife and I exploded at the same exact moment. Telling her to stop telling us what to do and how to do it. She argued with us saying that it’s her job and we have repeatedly disrespected the fact that she has a degree in this. We told her that she doesn’t know what it’s like to be a parent and how being a teacher is completely different.\n",

      "My sister ended up marching to her room mid-argument and I ended up consoling my wife who started frustratedly crying. Unfortunately, we had to leave for the airport right away so we went up to apologize to my sister for yelling but my sister was silent and didn’t reciprocate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was now 6 months ago. My only contact with my sister is through my mom since my sister won’t answer texts. My mom’s opinion is that nothing needs to be talked about because time will heal all wounds. My wife and I think that would fester into resentment which is upsetting to us because we are planning to have more kids soon and don’t want this issue arising with them again.\n",

He is the older brother of my close friend who knew I was looking for a place so he told me his older brother is also looking for a roommate.

But since April she has been staying here every single day, and every single night. I am still paying 50% of the rent and utilities and groceries. We only have one bathroom and she is in there anywhere from 1-3 hours per day. She also uses our food like the bread I buy, meats, vegetables, snacks and it all disappears a lot faster. It has been annoying me but I've been letting it slide. I started keeping a lot more of my food and drinks in my room.\n",

      "But earlier this month I noticed that an entire can of pringles I kept in my room and 2 of my protein bars had disappeared.

      "Last summer, Jake stayed with us for about six weeks between dorm leases. Emily was around a lot too, and honestly - it was tense. They didn’t really get along.

      "However, I work from home a few days a week, and when I’m in my home office, I wear headphones for calls or to listen to music so I can focus (I have ADHD and this really helps me). This morning, I was checking emails and listening to music in my office when my husband came in, visibly upset. He said he’d been calling my name from downstairs and was frustrated that I didn’t hear him because of my headphones. He was looking for his computer charger and said that if he didn’t have to run up and down the stairs, he’d have more energy to take care of things at home. He then told me I needed to empty the dishwasher because he was “too tired” of having to run up and down the stairs all of time.\n",

      "Side note: He does a lot around the house, which I really do appreciate. I am happy to do my part, but often he gets to things before I do because I’m working during the day. He is currently interviewing for jobs, but even though he isn’t working right now, he’s very busy working on our new house, networking, applying, and interviewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another instance last week: He told me in the morning he’d be going to the grocery store, so I helped make the list and then went to my home office to work. I had calls that morning, so my AirPods were in. I didn’t know exactly when he was planning to leave, or that he had left, because I was working. When he got home, he called my name to help unload groceries, but I didn’t hear him. He was frustrated again and said we keep having the same issue with my AirPods. I told him if I’d known he wanted help unloading or when he was coming back, I would have been ready, but I can’t monitor his actions while I’m working. He disagrees and says I’m in the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree that it was an issue in the past, but him expecting me to not wear my AirPods at all while I’m working feels a bit extreme. I feel frustrated because it’s hard for me to focus on work as it is, and I don’t think it’s fair for him to expect me to be available at any moment during my work hours just because I’m at home. I also feel like some of these issues could be solved with clearer communication, but he feels I should just be more considerate because he’s also busy.\n",

He would also ruin milestones such as my graduation by saying he was really disappointed in me. Growing up it felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells and he never knew me because every conversation had to be kept at surface level. If I said something wrong I’d be threatened and screamed at and lose the privilege of eating dinner. He wasn’t a bad father and had a few good moments but these are just some reasons why I am opposed to taking him in and not so close to him. \n",

      "Due to the fact that we never had a close relationship I decided that when he asked if I could take him in I said no. Him and my mother are separated so she’s not an option, his family lives states away, and my siblings are both too young (19 and 21) meaning that I would be his only option. Now I feel guilty for putting him in a nursing home because he  is paying for it out of his own pocket and he’s not able to afford that. I’m not punishing him I just don’t want to take care of him for the next 20 years because I have my own family now. He also wasn’t terrible or abusive so I’m wondering if this is too extreme.
