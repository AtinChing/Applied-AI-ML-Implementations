    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**\n\nAskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.\n\nThis is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.\n\n\\-The AskReddit mods",

         "We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \\_\\_\\_\\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a \"shower thought\" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.\n* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe Ass Credit Mods",

One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers.

She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n\nHowever, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n\nI tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.\n\nNow, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.\n\nI'm not sure what I should do, or what I *can* do. I don't know what to apologize *for* and I feel like my friends are siding with her.\n\nTL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.",

         "\n36F 37M we've been together for 3.5 years \n\nTL;DR My \"perfect\" boyfriend risked my life and didn't think it was a big deal.\n\n\nI’m upset because my boyfriend didn’t tell me I had a seizure until 11:45 PM the next day. I’m having a bad reaction to my seizure meds and working closely with my neurologist, so I needed to know right away—especially because I drove that day, which I never would’ve done if I knew.\n\nHe told me not to talk to him that day because he was “busy at work,” but later admitted it was really because I was being clingy. He didn’t check on me once, and still told me what meals he wanted, knowing I’d have to drive to the store to get ingredients.\n\nI feel ignored, unimportant, and honestly unsafe—not just because of what happened, but because of how he handled it.\n\nHe's never done anything remotely like this, been together 3.5 years and it's been amazing \n \nAfter I told him not to talk to me (we live together) and he respected that.\n\nTold him yesterday I'm ready to talk but I'm unsure what to say",

         "My partner (25F) and I (33M) have been together for 5 years and recently became parents to a 6-month-old. Since the birth, I’ve experienced a huge drop in libido. I don’t feel the same desire for intimacy anymore, and it’s become a real issue in our relationship.\n\nShe doesn’t pressure me for sex, but she’s internalizing the change. She asks if I think she’s fat or unattractive and says she feels rejected. I’ve told her honestly that I still find her beautiful and that this change is coming from me, not from anything she’s done. But she doesn’t believe me.\n\nIt’s now impacting our emotional closeness. She’s more withdrawn, less affectionate, and I can feel a growing distance. I want to reconnect with her, but I don’t know how to repair this gap while I’m still feeling disconnected from myself too.\n\n**Length of Relationship:**  \nTogether 4 years, baby is 6 months old\n\n**What I’m looking for advice on:**  \nWhat are healthy ways to rebuild emotional and physical intimacy when one partner is experiencing low libido? How can I make her feel seen and loved while I work through this? I’m also open to advice from anyone who's gone through something similar postpartum (as a partner or parent).\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nSince our baby was born, I \\[33M\\] have almost no sex drive. My partner \\[25F\\] thinks I find her unattractive, and it’s affecting our connection. I want to make things better but don’t know where to start.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nWife and I read the comments. Truly appreciate you all. We have decided to talk about some of the advice mentioned in the thread. Also, I will call the doctor first thing tomorrow to check my testosterone levels. ",

         "I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.",
         "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n\nFor context:\n\n* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n\nBefore moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n\nAt the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nAbout the dog:\n\n* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n\nFast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n\nAfter 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n\n**How should I approach this conversation with him?**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMoved in with my boyfriend (M/27) last year. Despite agreeing to hold off on getting a dog, he pressured me into it a month later. He travels a lot, and I end up being the sole caretaker for both his anxious herding dog and my own lower maintenance dog. After 10 days of solo dog duty, I’ve hit a breaking point. I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.",

         "Hi yall,\n\nSo i just needed some advice. me and my friend who hasn’t had sex in 2 years have been ig seeing eachother the past 2 weeks. we kissed twice prior to this weekend. so as u can tell things were getting serious. We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n\nTl:dr i was making out with a friend and was about to have sex, as soon as i was ready to put it in i became soft, need advice",

         "I ended my engagement and have regrets. (27F) (30M)",
         "Hi everyone,\nI (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n\nBut things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n\nHis family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him. And still, when I asked for support or tried to express how I felt, I was told I was making things about me or being too sensitive.\n\nAs time went on, I started to feel like the relationship was incredibly one-sided. His goals, his plans, and his needs always came first. Mine were often ignored or treated like they weren’t as important. I still loved him, but I didn’t feel like I mattered. The emotional weight of the relationship became too much.\n\nThe last straw was when he brought up a prenup. It wasn’t the fact that he wanted one, but the way and timing of how it came up. It made me feel even more like I wasn’t truly seen or trusted. It confirmed what I had already been feeling for a long time. I didn’t feel like an equal, and I didn’t feel emotionally safe.\n\nI eventually made the decision to walk away. And even though part of me feels clear about why I left, another part of me keeps wondering if I made the right call. Maybe it was just a hard season. Maybe I was overwhelmed. Or maybe choosing myself was exactly what I needed to do.\n\nI still care about him. I still think about the good moments. But I also know how hard it felt to be in it.\n\nAny honest thoughts or perspective would mean a lot. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR:\nEnded a 4 year relationship after getting engaged. We argued constantly, I felt unheard and unappreciated, and the way he brought up a prenup was the final straw. Still love him, but I didn’t feel emotionally safe. Now I’m wondering if I gave up too soon.",

         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?",
         "My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself 24/7. \n\n\n• Every time I do something it’s always “why are you doing it like that?” or “why don’t you just do this” or even more aggravating, he says “that’s unnecessary”. Every single day. I will say I want to do something a certain way and he questions me about it and I explain to him why I want to do something the way I want and it’s deemed “unnecessary” (his words) even if it has absolutely nothing to do with him. He’s told me before that he does it to help me but I have my own reasons for doing things my way. Even when he explains to me why he thinks it’s unnecessary to do something the way I want, I listen to him and consider his suggestion and go with my way and he calls me crazy for not listening to his advice that I never asked for. \nMy husband is very intelligent, I would say he is much smarter than me and I think some of his ways are efficient but it’s the fact that I cannot have my own ideas without criticism. \n\nEVERY TIME I do chores, he will ask me if I’m okay and I’ll say “yeah I just have a lot to do”(i do all the house chores and take care of our four month old baby and he goes to work, does the outdoor stuff and takes out the trash) and EVERY TIME he’ll say “well dont do that right now it’s unnecessary. Go lay down and take a nap, I’ll do it later”. I tried that before, you know, let him “do it later” like he said; just to see when exactly “later” meant to him and the laundry piled up so bad it was overflowing and covering the entire floor, the dishes stunk in the sink, the house was a mess. I told him this is what happens when you say “I’ll do it later” and this is why I don’t feel comfortable waiting to do chores. He said “I was getting to it”. Yeah make me feel like crap for doing chores and tell me you’ll take care of it then proceed to not do what you said you’d do. \n\n• On top of that, he doesn’t like listening to the stuff I enjoy talking about. For example, I will read a book a really enjoy and I’m so excited to talk about it with him, if he isn’t interested, he just stares blankly at me and says nothing. He listens which I appreciate but if it’s something he just doesn’t care about, he says “and?” or he just nods his head and turns away. \n\nNow I understand if you’re not interested in something it’s hard to act like you are but he tells me stuff 50 times a day I don’t care about at all like politics, or what’s in the news, or something in his game, or just random stupid facts. The difference between him and me when it comes to that is I try to be interested or I will at least I pretend to be. He doesn’t even try. It makes me feel so small when he does this to me. \n\n————————————————————————\n\n- We’ve had a conversation about this MANY times and I’ve told him that it makes me feel terrible about myself and he always says “well that’s just who I am, I can’t change that”. I don’t know what to say to that. I just stop talking after that. I have addressed many issues I’ve had with him before and he’s changed his ways but this he can’t change. \n\n- I just decided not to talk to him a lot anymore. Not about something I’m interested in or excited about, not when I’m doing stuff, I just try to avoid his words. I know he loves me and he does prove it to me every day by giving me love and affection and doing things for me and helping me around the house (when he feels like it) but these things just make me feel super bad about myself. Am I overreacting? \n\nTL;DR My husband (25M) makes me (23F) feel bad about myself. Am I overreacting?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: As I’m reading some of the comments, I see that this behavior is not normal and that I am not overreacting. I always heard that marriage is hard but I genuinely do believe that he cares about me and he loves me because he shows me and he HAS changed his ways before when I brought up other issues I’ve had with him. I’m going to try different approaches and see how that works now that I am more aware of how he is treating me is wrong. Thank you everyone for your advice and opening my eyes. ",

      "Body text: Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \\[33F\\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n",

      "However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n",

      "Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",

      "For context:\n",

      "* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n",
      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",

      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",

I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much.

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "I (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him. And still, when I asked for support or tried to express how I felt, I was told I was making things about me or being too sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on, I started to feel like the relationship was incredibly one-sided. His goals, his plans, and his needs always came first. Mine were often ignored or treated like they weren’t as important. I still loved him, but I didn’t feel like I mattered. The emotional weight of the relationship became too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last straw was when he brought up a prenup. It wasn’t the fact that he wanted one, but the way and timing of how it came up. It made me feel even more like I wasn’t truly seen or trusted. It confirmed what I had already been feeling for a long time. I didn’t feel like an equal, and I didn’t feel emotionally safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I eventually made the decision to walk away. And even though part of me feels clear about why I left, another part of me keeps wondering if I made the right call. Maybe it was just a hard season. Maybe I was overwhelmed. Or maybe choosing myself was exactly what I needed to do.\n",

Go lay down and take a nap, I’ll do it later”. I tried that before, you know, let him “do it later” like he said; just to see when exactly “later” meant to him and the laundry piled up so bad it was overflowing and covering the entire floor, the dishes stunk in the sink, the house was a mess. I told him this is what happens when you say “I’ll do it later” and this is why I don’t feel comfortable waiting to do chores. He said “I was getting to it”.

      "\n",
      "Even after the move, I stayed in touch with them regularly. I visited when I could, we chatted online, and I felt like I was still part of the group. But now that we’re in our final school year and preparing for exams, it feels like everything’s changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve grown closer to each other and more distant from me. We don’t really talk unless I’m the one reaching out, and even then, the conversations feel surface-level. I’m starting to realize that I’m not really part of their lives anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn’t say I have no one — maybe two people from the group still check in occasionally — but I can’t even be sure where I stand with them anymore. It just feels like they’ve moved on, and I’m stuck in the past trying to hold on to something that’s fading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know friendships change over time, especially during high school, but this still hurts. I don’t blame anyone — life happens — but I guess I just feel left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is this just part of growing up? And how do you even start to build new friendships when you feel like everyone already has their circles?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; I moved schools a few years ago but kept in touch with my old friend group. Now that we’re in our final school year, they’ve all drifted away and I feel like I’ve been left behind. Only maybe two still talk to me, and even that’s uncertain. Not sure how to deal with the loneliness or how to form new friendships this late in high school.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been dating an amazing girl for 7 months now. Her personality is the best I could ask for understanding, considerate, kind, unmaterialistic. She does have mental problems like insecurities, scared to call people but I couldn’t care less about them. And I did love her in the beginning. However recently I started doubting my own feelings. One moment I look at her and see the cutest being ever and then the other I just feel empty. I do have my own issues associated with childhood like abandonment threats when I was a kid and other abusive things revolving round my childhood. I was also raised to be as efficient as I could be and well we know relationships are not efficient at all.And so recently I was wondering what to do because I just can’t understand my own feelings. I either feel like I love her or simply nothing towards her. But when I imagine her cry I wanna cry and throw up. When I imagine breaking up with her I just can’t help but hesitate that im breaking smth that I shouldn’t. I just feel so conflicted and broken right now. We r a bit codependent since I dknt really need people around me and she is an introvert who finds it hard to find new people. So maybe the issue it that? I jus really don’t understand what im supposed to do\n",

      "\n",
      "Im a F (27) my bf of 5 almost 6 years is 34. He’s an amazing man and step dad he literally takes care of everything but he is not affectionate in general. He tells me he loves me as well as my son who he has been in his life since my son was 2 and basically helped me raise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never snuggles and never gives me random kisses etc unless he’s drunk. We smoke flower together and his personality doesn’t change but when he drinks he opens up like a Book. He tells me all about his life and gives me so much affection it feels like I’m in a movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand when he’s working (we both work from home) he gets so easily bothered if I try to take his attention away from Work even for a second. Then if I get mad it usually carries on til after work.\n",

      "The reason I’m posting is because this happened again right now and all I can think of is I feel like getting him something to drink so that he can be nice to me again. But I feel like that’s not right. I know I should probably compromise and accept that he isn’t generally an affectionate person but it drives me crazy knowing he has the capability to do the things that would make me so happy and he just doesn’t unless he’s had a couple drinks.\n",

      "Title: Our friend (24M) of 9 years suddenly blocked me (25F) and me (25F) our entire friend group. I’m hurt and confused. How do I process this?\n",
      "Body text: This is a platonic relationship so I am unsure if this will be accepted but here goes nothing :/ So a close friend of ours (24M) recently blocked and unfollowed all of us. His main friend group consists of girls, and he removed us from WhatsApp, Instagram, and even blocked our phone numbers. It was completely out of the blue and has left us feeling confused, worried, and honestly, really hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days ago, I messaged him just to check in because I hadn’t heard from him and noticed that his WhatsApp was stuck on one tick. There was no response. I tried reaching out on other platforms too, but still nothing. Eventually, I tried calling his SIM, but it was turned off. That’s when I got really concerned. I reached out to the rest of our friend group to see if they had heard from him. None of them had, and his phone was also unreachable for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one of our friends noticed he had unfollowed all of us on Instagram. That’s when I really started to worry. I suspected he might have blocked me on WhatsApp too, so I used my dad’s phone to call and text him. It went through immediately. I realized he had blocked me. I tested his SIM as well from my dad’s number. It rang. So not only did he block us from social media and WhatsApp, he also blocked our numbers. Again, no explanation, no message, nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, we weren’t in a fight or anything to suggest he wanted nothing to do with us. I was checking in because I was genuinely concerned, and it was unlike him not to talk for more than 5 days. He recently went through a tough breakup and has been in a rough emotional state. I went over to his place multiple times to check on him when he said he needed a friend. I understand grief and needing space, but his choice to block the people trying to support him felt so hurtful. I even reached out to an old mutual friend from school who still talks to him. I explained the situation, told him our friend had been going through a breakup, and mentioned that the girl he was seeing had apparently gotten engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today. The mutual friend messaged me again and asked if I was sure she got engaged. I said yes, and that the friend who blocked us told me she was, which was why he was so heartbroken. Then the mutual friend told me he just posted a picture of her on his story.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it all started to make sense. It seems he may have done what he did because this same girl has never liked us and has previously made efforts to cut us out of his life. Now it seems like he may have blocked and unfollowed us at her request. The fact that he is still in contact with her and even posting her on his story makes it look like they may have gotten back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "What hurts most is that I thought we had a strong friendship. We’ve traveled together. Spent years being there for each other. I know some of the others in our group only know him online, but I’ve shared real memories with this guy. For him to shut us out like this, without even a goodbye or a reason, is devastating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t even know if I want to be friends again if he eventually comes back and acts like nothing happened. Because he’s done that before. It’s awkward. And it feels so one-sided. I just don't know how to process this and I have been crying so much today.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "Friend (24M) recently went through a breakup and suddenly blocked our entire friend group from social media, WhatsApp, and phone calls. I was really worried and tried reaching out in every way possible. Later found out from a mutual friend that he posted his ex on his story, suggesting he may have blocked us because she asked him to. It’s hurtful, especially after everything we’ve shared. I don’t know how to process it.\n",

      "5. She made a big deal about the group splitting up to get ready for a grad party, claiming that she was left behind and we all were going to hang out without her. We only split up for an hour and she did not come along since she was staying in a different place. The whole event was very stressful and dramatic and honestly made me feel uncomfortable throughout the rest of the night.\n",

      "Title: I [36M] opened up to my romantic interest [29F] about my past trauma. I feel like I shouldn't have done it.\n",
      "Body text: Long-story-short, I met a person who makes me feel a way that I haven't felt in a very long time. Let's call her Jane. By sheer coincidence, Jane is colleagues with somebody I know. I haven't had a good relationship with that colleague in the past for unrelated reasons. However, that colleague is also a known manipulator and resorted to twisting some facts about my father's very recent funeral.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, my father didn't contact me in over 20 years. I reached out multiple times, but he simply wasn't interested in maintaining a relationship. As a result, I didn't attend his funeral, when he died recently. I was devastated because now I will never learn why he didn't want me, but I also didn't want to go to the funeral, as we weren't close, and he didn't care about me. And my sister, who ignored me up to that point, suddenly wanted me to chip in for the funeral and help her organize things, which I refused. He owed me and my mom a ton of money for not paying alimony for years, so it seemed like an extra spit in my face to be requested that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the colleague knew about this and informed Jane about my absence from the funeral and my refusal to share the costs, but didn't share the context. They even threw in a couple extra lies about me, like how I supposedly made up a story about my father not paying alimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked and upset when Jane told me this. As a result, I felt the need to tell her my side of the story. Thus, I had to share about my childhood, what actually happened, and that I grew up without my biological father. Unfortunately, this story is also indirectly connected to the fact that I'm essentially not in touch with anybody from my family. My father's side was absent, and my mother happens to be a narcissist. Years ago, I refused to allow her to manipulate and abuse me anymore, and that side of the family took her side. Thus, I'm sort of \"solo\" while having a lovely relationship with my teenage son.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get a bit into a spiral when I talk about these things. I just want to be transparent with who the other person is talking to. In this case, I know that Jane is very careful about who she connects with, so I just wanted to be extra transparent about some of my background. I know that there are things in my past that can be red flags to some. So, I explained my family background, how that led to some other issues along the way, that I got into therapy, started reading psychology books, and doing various mental exercises to overcome issues from my past. I'm now about 5 years out of therapy, and living a good life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made sure to also mention that I'm fine now, that I have AMAZING friends (seriously, I completely won the lottery on that front), that I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time with them and their parents when I was younger, and they served as positive role models for me. I absolutely LOVE my son and I give him more attention in a week than my father has given me in decades. I do well financially, have fun hobbies. In short, I'm good.\n",
      "\n",

      "Body text: We’ve been together 4 years, live together for 3 and I really love him so much! Our relationship is strong and we rarely argue but the times that we do I feel like he doesn’t really care about how I feel. Anytime we have an argument where I feel disrespected or he’s in the wrong he just goes silent and stares at me or his phone or literally anything else rather than actually have a conversation with me about it. It drives me insane and it makes me even more angry about the situation and it just makes it into an even bigger thing! I could understand if I was shouting at him and he didn’t wanna add fuel to the fire but I genuinely bring up these matters as calmly as possible! I grew up in a household where my parents screamed at each other over every disagreement big or small and I said I’d never be like that in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’ll just not speak and it feels like pulling teeth! And when I feel like I’m owed an apology I have to say something like “are you even sorry” and the response is almost always on the line of “well obviously I’m sorry” which honestly doesn’t feel like a real apology considering I had to basically ask for one and it’s not been said with really any remorse in his voice or tone. He’ll just avoid me until I eventually have to break the ice and change the subject and it feels like I have to basically just get over it because he’s not going to try and fix it or at least even just give me a hug or something and say sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s annoying too because if he does something that bothers me or feels disrespectful I’ll ask him why did he do it and the answer is almost always “I don’t know” which doesn’t feel like a real answer. And if I say if I did that would you like it and he says no I’ll ask again so why did you do it and again he just says I don’t know which sometimes annoys him because I keep asking the same question expecting a different answer but I just don’t believe the answer is he doesn’t know all the time. If I ever do something that bothers him or whatever I will always communicate with him and make sure he feels heard and apologise but I just don’t seem to get that same respect in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "We argued yesterday and I got all of this from him and I just refuse right now to just get over it to simply be on speaking terms when my feelings are still hurt and he’s done nothing to show he cares about that or at the very least apologise. I know some might think I’m petty for not talking but honestly I’ve just nothing to say to him right now. And it’s not like he’s made any effort to speak to me. I just don’t wanna keep arguing with basically the wall so I guess I’m just waiting and hoping he’ll act like he gives a fuck. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do and where to go from here?\n",

      "Body text: So last night me and my boyfriend had an argument about how I think that he doesn’t put any effort in towards the relationship, and he got annoyed that I was upset about that and says that I am “nitpicking” at everything he does. For context, this is my first real relationship and this is his fourth. By him not putting in any effort/not giving me what I want I mean by, when we sleepover together he won’t wake up until the last possible moment he can for when one of us needs to go to work or do something we have to so we don’t get to spend any mornings together whereas I wake up a couple hours before. I also have wrote him love letters, made a scrapbook for us, bought him things for his car to celebrate it getting fixed after 2 weeks, I have him on my lockscreen, my location is on. On the other hand, he has never done anything meaningful for me and from day one I told him every now and again I need reassurance and I only ever get it from arguing, he refuses to put his location on when Ive said its not a trust thing its more so I can be ready in time for when he comes and picks me up so I can see how far off he is, he wont put me on his lockscreen and he wont post me and his phone is always with him when we’re together and when he’s not on it’s face down. He also mentions breaking up near enough every time we have an argument when it doesn’t even cross my mind when we argue.\n",

      "The more important part of this post is that this huge argument we had, he apologised and said he will do better and I also said I would do better because I said I can’t continue in this relationship if I don’t see any change. I recently started a new job which means we don’t see each other often now as we work kind of opposite times. I got home from work today around 6pm and he has been off work all day and at home doing nothing and he is off all day tomorrow while I work 9-5. I asked him when I got home if we are going to facetime at all tonight and his response was “was gonna play xbox” despite the fact that less than 24 hours ago he agreed that he needs to put more effort in. He has had all day to play xbox and he has all night too because I will go to sleep around 11pm and he will be up until 2am. Yet if I bring up that this has annoyed me he will get annoyed at me.\n",

      "Body text: I, 17m just had my 6 month anniversary with my 17f girlfriend. I have always been a reserved person and never liked physical touch in public. In the very beginning of our relationship I hated any kind of physical touch that wasn’t private. She got really upset and we got into a huge argument. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with PDA but I am willing to compromise because that is what relationships are about. And I did. I’m ok hugging and kissing and holding hands in public now as long as it’s not too much. But she always wants to climb on me and lay on me and do all of this stuff I’m not comfortable with and we just got into another argument about it today.

      "My parents are divorced and my father is mentally unstable. A bit of a background on him... He is currently paying all the bills and rent in the apartment they both live in. I have no doubt that if he had one of his \"episodes\" any day now, he would scream and throw her onto the street. He buys food and some other necessities but the environment at home is extremely toxic and not stable at all. He has a lot of mental issues that never got resolved, as well as an addiction, and he harbors anger towards her for their divorce, despite treating her like garbage during their marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother is a grown woman but I consider her extremely vulnerable. She is not originally from America and is not extremely tech-savvy. I often have to help her with computer-related questions or just anything pertaining to social media or using her smartphone, etc. To be clear, she is able to use them on her own, but often doesn't know how to do basic functions such as how to take a screenshot, etc. things that aren't immediately obvious. I also believe she is depressed. She had an extremely difficult life prior to marrying my father and he made things even worse through emotional and psychological abuse, even financial abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "She never worked while raising me and ultimately started looking for a job a few years back. This was around the time of the divorce. She looked for whatever work she could find, and eventually was able to land a decent-paying office role with her prior experience. She worked a few temporary roles and was laid off from her most recent one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years back, she also started to get into new age beliefs and practices, which will be more relevant later. She started getting into stuff like Tony Robbins and just any famous \"motivational\" speaker, or any person who claims to know about secret knowledge to letting the universe give you what you want, stuff of that nature.\n",

      "Recently, my mom decided to stop looking for a job and open her own business. She wants to be a life coach, work from home, and not go to a boss for a paycheck. She started taking online courses from a college for this stuff and is trying to get certified in \"breathwork\". This is concerning to me on so many levels. First of all, she doesn't understand that becoming a life coach requires actual experience and certification in coaching. Otherwise, you're just another one of those figureheads on Instagram who want you to buy their book or attend their webinar on how to \"become\" a life coach. I think she went down that rabbit hole and got enticed by the idea of working for herself, and since she is on a \"self discovery journey\", she decided she'll be a life coach and help others with her positive mindset and whatnot. She didn't even know you can't mention mental health during your sessions, because that is a completely different field of work and she is not qualified whatsoever to discuss such a sensitive topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all she does is her courses, read new age books, and partake in group sessions where people discuss their feelings and how breathwork helped them. If she wants to do that, that's her choice to make. But she is playing with fire, in my opinion. I can't believe she is just okay with not looking for a job. There is no guarantee my father will let her stay with him and she would literally be homeless and have zero money. Yes, I would take her in. But she is honestly a very difficult person. She is extremely negative and broken, and it really weighs me down. I do my best to be loving and patient with her, because I love her, but she wasn't a perfect parent either. I am not really leaping at the idea of taking her in, to be honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought this up to her several times and she always has an excuse. \"Well, I can't work full-time and do school full-time. I need to devote my energy to one or the other\". I literally work full-time and attend online school full-time and have plenty of free time. Or she'll bring up how she's tired of relying on a boss for a paycheck, and you should try to be your own boss. I told her that nobody just starts a business with no income and no way to fund it, and she doesn't listen. She's convinced that her positive mindset will lead her where she needs to be. Maybe, but it's extremely nerve-wracking thinking about what could happen to her. And again, I have my own life and I have my own little family growing. I am not excited about the idea of having to support her, as harsh as that may sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need advice on how to approach this issue. I don't know if I should even bother confronting her, but I worry a lot. I think she is being incredibly naive and that she has just fallen into some kind of denial. I feel terrible and she doesn't listen to anything I say. Again, I want to reiterate that I am frustrated that 1. she is NOT looking for work and is just hoping her business idea takes off, and 2. she doesn't even have skills or experience, and just thinks that because she's into self-help and new age stuff, that she can help others. Those are my exact frustrations. Any advice would be appreciated.\n",

      "* The way she talks to me. First is the sarcasm. I have raised this twice before, and it usually stops for a while, but so far it always comes back. It can be small stuff like when I ask about when her train is again I get the whole 'ugh how have you already forgot!'. It would be fine sometimes, but it just feels relentless. I see other couples who seem to be always on each other's side, but she seems to love the opposite - always going against the other person. She only means it jokingly/sarcastically, but I don't want that. In texting she's so lovely and supportive, and then she's a completely different person when calling/talking. I just wish the texting persona could be more prevalent in real life.\n",
      "* Second is harder to define, but it's really the lack of ability for serious conversation. I'll tell her a whole story, and she'll just do a 'cutesy' childish voice and say something like 'I'm so proud of you!'. I feel she is a bit insecure about this as she recently got upset about just standing awkwardly there while we were out with my friends and not knowing what to say. But again, I just wish we could have better conversations/communication.\n",
      "* It bothers me how unhealthy she is. I keep myself fit, because I see the long term benefits. She is actually physically in good shape, I guess because she hardly eats anything, but she is constantly snacking on high-sugar foods, and never does any exercise. I have not told her this bothers me, because it seems very inappropriate to mention, as it's about her body. She doesn't have real hobbies either. I am always up to something, but she just watched tv and snacks when she's alone.\n",
      "* We recently argued when I said on the phone one night I didn't really want to continue talking because of how negative she was being towards me. It was again the sarcasm, but to me it's still negativity. She got really upset and went off about how upset she was that I wasn't so excited about going with her family on holiday this year. This was regarding a conversation from many months ago btw - I asked her why she was only raising it now, but no real answer. She then went silent for like 30 minutes, just giving short answers while I tried to talk through everything. I am a very open communicator in arguments. What bothered me the most was I could hear her typing o her phone, while being silent to me. I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to make wrong accusations, but I guess she was typing with a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of her biggest problems is her mental health. She really struggles with self-image (although she is objectively very pretty - this comes from being overweight during childhood), and she is stressed about university exams and not finding a job. Most of her negativity I know comes from a place of insecurity. For example I played tennis, then invited her, and then I got all the jokes about how I only invited her because I had to as my girlfriend. I know she's just insecure about doing something sporty, and turning the joke on me is her coping mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also really loves me. She envisions our lives together, which also scares me because I simply don't know if I do. I'm also scared of the effect it could have on her if I did end things.

      "Body text: So basically me and my gf have been a couple for around 5 months and honestly it has been one of the best times of my life. And she is one of the best people I've ever met in my life. I love this woman so much and we actually match so well and also all my friends and family just also tell me how well we match and that we seem like a match made in heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just lately our physical intimacy has kinda shifted to a point where she just doesn't want to do it anymore. I was open and decided to put all my strength together and have an open, honest talk about it where I asked her if there was something wrong. She told me it's because of her past expierences and that she tends to pressure herself so much to the point where she actually is not able to be intimate with me. So anyways, I told her that's it's completely fine and all I want is for her to feel safe and most importantly I need both of us to actually want it and I would never want sex with her if she doesn't feel like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left this convo understanding of her situation and I thought it was fine. Then when bedtime came around and she asked me to cuddle her I had a sharp sting in my chest. And I started to feel so hurt and mentally distressed because I started to feel so anxious to get horny when I am close to her and also just kind of wrong and disgusting for even wanting intimacy. I don't exactly know why but most likely it's also due to sexual trauma in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I tried to sleep but I was just having panic attacks because of it. I couldn't sleep the whole night. So as the days went on, the situation didn't really change. I still feel this sharp pain every single night and this has resulted into me actually having insomnia and me going to the doctor because I've been having severe insomnia since 3 months. (I've been getting medical treatment, seeing a psychiatrist and soon therapy). Still the situation keeps me up at night and makes me. feel so extremely guilty and selfish that I cannot cuddle my gf without being hurt myself and why I just cannot act \"normal\" and accept it without having a state of restlessness. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many nights where I don't sleep at all, even if I am not physically with her my mind keeps racing with questions. Especially when nighttime hits, everything feels worse and I stay awake the whole night just thinking if she finds me attractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I tried talking about it again in a calm, understanding setting and also being open with her why I actually have a hard time cuddling her and with my sleep. I do exactly know where she's coming from. I cannot possibly talk about it again since everytime I do, I worsen the situation because it makes her feel even more pressured seeing her partner struggle because of it. And I get it, I feel awful, I just wanna be okay with it and my body not stressing me about it anymore. The longer I don't sleep, the worse my body feels. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing I want to do is leave her. I love her so much and so wholeheartedly. And if there is literally any way of just getting through this I want to find it and get through this. I am just also so scared for my health since I literally do not sleep at all and my body is showing symptoms of sleep deprivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Also it's not her not wanting to have sex, because she does, it's just an internal pressure that she puts on herself which makes her so uncomfortable to have sex at all. And it's not her not finding me attractive, it's her feeling overwhelmed by it.)\n",

      "Body text: I (F35) and my business partner Molly (F38) started a small musical org almost 3 years ago. It began OK, but as our org has gotten busier, my trust in her has eroded: she's proven herself to be unreliable, a bad communicator, and very poor at follow-through on agreed upon tasks and schedules. \n",

      "I've tried multiple approaches to help solve for this, including multiple meetings, clearer role definitions and breakdowns, calendars, etc, all of which she agreed to in theory but not in practice. I feel like I'm the one managing things professionally, while also managing her *and* being the emotional barometer for our relationship. I'm exhausted and done, especially after the past two weeks. The problem is that we have a big week-long project coming up in less than a month, where we're partnering with another organization. **I'm trying to decide whether to tell her beforehand or afterwards that I'm stepping away.** \n",

However, if she reacts poorly then we could be in for a really rough week that could reflect poorly on us both. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context about where things are: 1.5 weeks ago, I finally professionally and firmly called her out more directly on a big bungle caused by her last-minuteness (far from the first time this kind of thing has happened). She deflected, took no responsibility for it, and tried to turn it back around on me. When I brought it back around to the issue at hand, she stopped responding. This included ignoring two other emails with time-sensitive logistical tasks that needed answers from her (including one involving our partner org), so after asking for input and receiving silence, I proceeded without her. \n",

      "Body text: I’m looking for some advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He loves me so much and wants to marry me, and I love him deeply too — it’s always been my dream to marry someone I love. But lately, there are a few things that feel off. Sometimes I wonder if I’m making a mistake or lowering my standards. And maybe he feels the same — I’m not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the things that bother me: 1.Whenever we fight, he starts cussing and calling me names.\n",
      "2.He never takes pictures of me. I know some boyfriends aren’t into photography, and that’s fair — but in my case, I’ve told him many times that it matters to me. I’ve asked him to take pictures or record small moments, not just of me, but us. He never does.\n",
      "3.He doesn’t always respect my opinions. Sometimes, I feel like there’s a subtle competition between us instead of support.\n",
      "4.On my last birthday, he didn’t even give me a gift. I understand money can be tight sometimes, and I don’t expect anything fancy (he earns) — my dad pampers me a lot and gives me everything I need, so maybe that’s why I have expectations. But I didn’t want something expensive — just flowers would’ve meant a lot. I celebrate him, so I just wish he celebrated me a little too.and \n",
      "5.I want small gestures — a flower, a note, anything. Am I expecting too much?\n",
      "6.We’ve had sex just 3 times in 3 years. But we do enjoy our fun moments, and those times are genuinely great.\n",
      "7.He never liked me having male friends, and I respected that. In all 4 years of college, I never had any male friends — even though we were in the same college.\n",
      "My issue is simple: I feel a lack of affirmation, acts of service, and respect.\n",
      "He’s called me horrible names in the past, including “sl*t.” Sometimes during fights, he says very hurtful things. He never really celebrates me. I’ve never felt seen by him. But he always wants to go out with me and spend quality time, which I genuinely enjoy. And he’s extremely loyal — no contact with any girls or anything shady. That’s one of the best things about him.\n",
      "But he’s made me feel insecure so many times. During fights, when I get emotional or throw a tantrum, he doesn’t comfort me — he never sends long texts to say sorry, never calls to express how much he loves me. I guess he’s not expressive, so I give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "Still, in fights, he tells me to go look in the mirror, or says I could do better, then the next day, he acts like nothing happened and tries to fix things. Honestly, I do give him credit — he has saved our relationship many times. But I also feel like I’m too easy to convince. We’re both deeply attached. Three years is a long time. We’ve made such good memories together. I know he loves me, and I love him too.\n",
      "But yesterday, I told him everything and broke up.We’ve never stayed away from each other for more than a day, so this is hard.Now that we’ve graduated, I’m moving to a different city for my studies, and he’s staying back. A long-distance relationship is going to be tough — especially since he doesn’t trust me. He always wants to know where I am, even though I’m a homebody and mostly go out only with family or with him. He has all my passwords. I’m not hiding anything.\n",
      "He’s truly a sweet boy, and I know he really loves me — it shows in so many ways. I love him too, deeply. But honestly, I feel like maybe it’s better for both of us to break up and take some time to be single — to grow individually and focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves.\n",
      "I truly believe that growth is important — for him and for me. We both have dreams and goals, and maybe this space will help us achieve them without distractions or emotional weight. And who knows, if destiny has its way, maybe we’ll find our way back to each other someday.\n",
      "For now, I just hope he continues to grow into a great man and becomes the kind of partner he’s truly capable of being. And I’ll focus on becoming the woman I want to be too.\n",
      "So, what should I do?\n",
      "Will I ever find someone who’s loyal like him? Or am I just too easy? Do I not deserve to be treated like I’m special — to be given that “princess treatment”?\n",
      "I don’t know. I have so much self-doubt.\n",
      "Should I leave this relationship?\n",
      "Or should I talk to him and give it one last chance and start as fresh?\n",
      "I’ve already talked to him so many times, and told him what hurts me. I know I’m not perfect — but when I love someone, I want to be pampered and cared for. Even when I push him away during fights, I hope he’d come back with respect and tell me how much he loves me — not by yelling or insulting me, but by reassuring me. I want someone who has eyes only for me, someone who adores me. I want to feel safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I’m willing to change too. For him, for us. But respect comes from the heart — and love and respect are not the same.\n",

      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. We love each other, but there’s been disrespect, lack of effort, and emotional hurt. He’s loyal, but not expressive or supportive in ways I need. I broke up with him recently because I feel we need time to grow individually, but I’m confused — am I expecting too much? Should I give him one last chance or move on?\n",

      "Body text: My friend and I were both recently laid off from our full time jobs. She had just started shortly before being laid off and spent a good chunk of her savings to move to a new city for the job.There was no relocation provided and she’s stuck with seven months left on her lease and no good way to pay it.

I want to help but after going through a layoff I’m kind of anxious about saving as much as possible in case it happens again, and $3k is a large amount of money. I was thinking to draft a promissory note asking her to give me her camera equipment and road bike (~$2800 value) and if she hasn’t paid the balance or started making payments by December then I’d sell her things and we’d consider the debt settled. The road bike is sentimental to her as it was a gift and she won a competiton on it. My other friend who I floated the idea with thinks it’s kind of a jerk move to ask for it and even suggesting it would sour the relationship. It’s the only thing she has that’s really of value and while I can imagine she’d probably want to ride it to decompress while unemployed, I also need assurance that I’m going to be made whole.

      "Body text: My bf (20m) and I (21f) have known each other for the last 6, almost 7 years. We have been together for almost three of those years, and spent the last 9 months living together in a tiny little studio flat whilst he finishes his last year at university, and I complete my second. \n",
      "This last nine months with the flat was super difficult, I was working a lot and I can be quite a handful sometimes and he would spend all of his time gaming - however he has just found himself a job and he loves it.

      "Our personalities are quite different, im quite introverted and used to be so unbelievably shy and anxious, but have since worked on that - though I’m still fairly quiet but have a few different friend groups.

We’re both stubborn and argumentative, with different opinions on things and we both kind of worry that this will impact us more down the line, like if we choose to have kids. \n",

      "Now I know we’re young, and to be fair we’ve both thought about this issue, but aren’t looking too far into the future right now.

      " I (21F) started a new degree last September. A small group of 5 people formed in our programme, and I took a lot of initiative to invite them to many events because I am the only person in the group who was not new to the city we study at. The group was very sweet and we hung out a few times. However, most of the people turned out to be not so social and eventually when I invited people only one person showed up, let's call him X (24M). At first, I liked X a lot, he is kindhearted, smart, and an interesting person. Later however a few things happened that made me feel a bit uncertain about our forming friendship, something shifted:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- he wanted to meet at least once every week and assumed that I would take him to events (makes sense, I started that pattern), but without the friend group I felt like I had to always pay attention to him at the events. Our way of partying also didn't match. I felt like he came just to talk to me and did not actually for the event. One instance I talked to my other friends much more at a party, people who I happened to vibed better with. The next day in front of another person he asked if I actually enjoyed spending time with him. I tried my best to reassure him. I guess he sensed my forming feelings but this came off very insecure and put me in a weird spot by not asking in private.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- I am his only friend in the city I think and he has implied that people from this country are not welcoming enough, which rubs me the wrong way, it is self-victimizing. He has shared a lot of troubles he has with me. this is both why I feel guilty not wanting to be there for him, but also the reason the friendship felt like work too early (but I never told him it was too much)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- once I mentioned how his personality is fun when he is drunk (without implying that it isn't he is sober) and he asked if I like this version more. I said not at all, but anyways, it doesn't matter he should only be himself. He said that it is important for him to adjust to people and he does this consciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- sometimes I find his jokes unfunny, which is completely fine, but on top of all these it makes me think we just don't click as friends\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- he told me he has anger management issues and he has been to many fights. now this is of course out of his control. but makes me feel uneasy\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very busy these days, I study, work, I have many friends who I am always happy and excited to hang out with and I am in a relationship. I also like, and want to spend time with myself and my hobbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now many months have passed (9 months), the friendship is not so new anymore and I have met him less and less frequently. He still reaches out to me. I am not sure how to handle this. I don't often end friendships and I feel like in this situation I don't have valid reasons to do so. This is a person who needs help and I got the ick partially because of this. Sometimes we still have good conversations. He has a very unique perspective on things and he has been nothing but kind to me. I think in a different circumstance I would be lucky to have him as my friend. But the more I have contemplated this, the more I think of this situation as a problem I have to solve rather than a potential friendship and this just spirals. I get nervous when he texts me nowadays.\n",

It’s been about a week, and I’ve been feeling like this isn’t what I want. He feels that my emotions are too much for him to deal with and that I need to get ‘hobbies’ that aren’t missing him. He doesn’t like when I ask him when I’ll see him next because it ‘makes him feel like I don’t care about him getting better for himself’. If I say I miss you too many times he says it feels redundant and that it’s unhealthy and I’m obsessive over the relationship and him. He believes that I didn’t take enough time to mentally prepare myself for him being gone whereas he feels like he properly mentally prepared himself so he “doesn’t spend half of his time thinking about how he misses me”.

      "Body text: Sorry this is long but: \n",
      "\n",
      "I 27F need advice about a relationship with a 30M. Long story short, we dated for a little over 2 years, but we are now broken up and I'd say we're still friends. Flash back to when we were dating: like most relationships everything started off good, but about a year in issues started. I was working full time and trying to figure out what to do with my life. I was (and still am) stressed. I am the one who told him how I was feeling and felt like a relationship was not in my best interest at the moment. Not only was stress a big factor in me deciding to end the relationship but also because my partner went through a spell of quitting his job and just spending most of his days sleeping, playing videos games and becoming depressed. I could tell he was becoming more depressed and I tried my best to help. I made sure he was fed, taking care of himself and I would see him almost every day after work. There were times where I had to tell him I couldn't come see him after work because either I had plans with some friends or had things I had to get together for myself at home. The days I couldn't see him, he would get really upset with me and we would argue but I really needed a break. This cycle went on for at least 8 months. I was completely burnt out, exhausted my bank account buying food everyday and just felt not myself. I felt like he wasn't trying to get better even though I was supporting him and I know depression is a sensitive and tricky subject but I feel like I tried my best to show him I was there but instead burnt myself out in the process. I've always been the kind of person to put others over myself but I'm learning how to not be that person to a certain extent. After the breakup, he did get a job and he started to be in a better place mentally. I ended up getting all my stuff together and am now in school getting my master's degree and working full time. My partner is working full time as well now but still has no clear direction where his life is headed. We've had the conversation about what he wants out of life and for the years I've known him is been the same answer of \"idk\". \n",
      "\n",
      "He tried (and is still trying) to rekindle the relationship but I have told him multiple times that I do not have romantic feelings for him. We're good as friends and that's where I'd like to stay. And this is where the problem is. \n",
      "\n",
      "We argue. ALL THE TIME. I told him I don't want to talk everyday, I'm cool with catching up every now and then and honestly if he did reach out everyday and the conversation was short I wouldn't mind, however, he expects me to text him back quick, answer every phone call and talk for hours everyday. I have school and work to deal with, along with other life things I have to get together too. If I don't talk to him his text to me get more and more angry about how I'm rude for not replying or ignoring him, but if I don't ignore him some days we'll talk all day everyday and I do not want that. I have talked to him in person about this and over text. He wants to hang out frequently and I do not. Which is something I have also expressed to him. When I don't hang out with him he gets upset with me and if we're together in person and doesn't \"get his way\" ( like I had to tell him to stop touching me in certain ways) he gets visibly pouty and upset like a toddler which I have called him out for. He's even pulled up to my house before without asking me first because I wasn't responding to him which I told him made me extremely uncomfortable and he knows that and I feel like he'll try to say stuff like \"I'm gonna pull up to your house\" just so I can respond to him because he knows I don't like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to add that I am not perfect in this situation either. Some days I'll tell him I'll call him before bed but I either fall asleep before I call or sometimes I really don't feel like being on the phone so I just don't call. ( I would love to be able to just tell him this, but it always leads to an argument so sometimes it's just easier to not call at all). And sometimes when we are on the phone and I don't want to be sometimes I can get snappy or not very involved in the conversation but I feel like a lot of the time he's not talking, just sitting in silence or playing his game and then gets upset at me for not \"talking enough\" or having a conversation and then he wants to talk to next day since he feels the conversation wasn't enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year I told him that I do want to talk anymore and I think it's best we go our separate ways...he was not cool with that and wanted a \"final conversation\" which I agreed to because I felt he wanted closure and I was okay with giving him that. We picked a date to have our final conversation and that date never came and when I would bring it up and remind him that he's the one who wanted a final conversation he never would pick a new date and would just blame it on the fact that he didn't know what my schedule looked like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also a big factor in us breaking up is I felt and still feel like I have to do most things for him. He never really tries to figure stuff out on his own and when I ask him to try it's always \"idk what that is \" or \"idk how to do that\" and honestly I'm frustrated and stressed. I am a very independent person and even if I do need help I'll at least try to figure it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends have been telling me to just block him and I don't want to be rude, however, he is the only constant stressor currently in my life and I'm coming to realize that I would be okay if we never talked again. I don't want to feel like someone's mom. I want a boyfriend, not a child as a partner. I feel like I have stated my boundaries over and over and yes I know I should be better at enforcing them because I do feel like he's learned he can step over my boundaries sometimes which doesn't help the issue so feel free to touch on that in the comments as well. I'm also trying to grow from this. \n",
      "\n",

We are still friends but he wants constant contact and I do not which I have expressed. I feel he still wants a relationship and I do not, which I have also expressed. None of my boundaries are respected by him.Don't want to be rude and block him but I'm becoming stressed out from the constant arguments. HELP. \n",

      "Title: Issues in marriage\n",
      "Body text: My husband (38M) told me (37F) that he feels unappreciated, unattached and is not sure “that we are meant to be”.  I asked him if he still wants to be married and he said he doesn’t  know. We have been together for 12yrs and married for 2 with a 5yr old child. I was his first girlfriend. He has only been in situationships  prior to meeting me. He doesn’t like to discuss his feelings and only talks when I initiate a conversation. He barely talks to me throughout the day and we only spend time together when we watch our favorite show on Fridays. We don’t date often and typical only go out a few times a year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our conversations are usually dry but he becomes very jovial when his friends or family call him. He is either glued to the TV, his phone or his PS5. I ask him to spend 20 or 30 minutes with me when I get home from work and he says he doesn’t want to talk because he needs time to destress after work and likes to play when his friends are online. (FYI,  He arrives home 2 hours before I get home from work). He says he is overwhelmed with picking our child up from school and reports that he does a lot to make sure that she is fed (it’s usually and happy meal and our child usually entertains herself or is glued to her tablet). His interactions with our child are very minimal at times. He doesn’t clean or help me do anything in the house but will jump up and help others with their house. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am stuck in an emotionless marriage and not sure what to do. He doesn’t  touch me and will only be interested I initiate sex. He doesn’t initiate sex with me anymore. He does give me a kiss and when he leaves and when I return but that pretty much it. I think most of the issues he has may have may be within him self and not me. I do a lot to support him and our household and I’m not sure what else I can do at this point. I asked him what can be done to make our relationship better, he reply was cook more and head!!!!! I also need to add that he has leaned on me a lot financially since I met him and I also paid for our wedding by myself. He started to support the household more last year. He pays the mortgage and a few bills, I pay the rest and pay for everything regarding my daughter except we share daycare expenses.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He recently started a weightless journey and is only focused on him self and his friends he works out with. He also recently started making a little more money and is less dependent on me. Just would like an outsider’s perspective about our situation. Sorry to be long winded and all over the place but I don’t have a lot of safe spaces to vent. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’m looking for some outside perspective on a situation that’s been bothering me for a while. I’ve been with my girlfriend (27F) for almost a year and a half now, and overall things are not always going well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s one thing that keeps nagging at me: her relationship with her male best friend (27M). I’ve met the guy once — he seems like a decent, geeky guy and from what I can tell, he’s respectful. That said, some past details of their friendship are making me uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we started dating, the two of them went to a sex club together. She told me about it openly, and reassured me that nothing happened between them — she said she’s never been attracted to him, and that he’s never seen her naked. I believe her, and I want to trust that. But still, that kind of shared experience is not something I can easily brush off.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, she once casually admitted that they spooned in bed one time — again, before we were together. No sex involved, just cuddling. But even so, it’s hard for me to reconcile that level of physical and emotional intimacy with their friendship. I've also noticed a strong sense of complicity between them and I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me feel a bit on edge as her partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I’m not trying to control who she’s friends with, and I appreciate her honesty. But I’m starting to wonder if I need to draw some boundaries here for the sake of my own emotional comfort. I’m not sure if I’m being insecure or if this is a valid concern to bring up.\n",

      "I (17F) have only been with my boyfriend, we’ll call him Tray (18M), for 3 months (it’ll be 4 tomorrow on the 20th), but I’m thinking about ending it. Various things keep piling up and I just don’t know if I can handle it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started smoking together and added our mutual friend, we’ll call him Felix (18M), to the sesh. A little backstory about my relationship with Felix. I met him when I started my first job. He was new in town and dating someone that I knew from school before I left. (I’ve been homeschooled since 2022 by my choice.) I didn’t like her because I had known her to be a cheater since the beginning of middle school. I warned him about her, and slowly, we started talking about our relationships. When I started my job, I was with another guy. We’ll call him Sebastian (17M). Felix was there for me the most out of anyone. When I was having a problem in my relationship, I wanted Felix. He listened, he was understanding, he was honest, and he was just real. When Sebastian and I broke up, Felix held me while I cried and told me it was going to be okay. He looked into my eyes, like REALLY looked into my eyes, and told me it was going to be okay and that I was going to get through it and everything was going to get better. Needless to say, Felix is a great guy, an even greater friend, and the BEST smoke buddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a little backstory about how my relationship with Tray started. I met him my first day of work. He was a customer. He came in everyday, and I took a liking to him. One day, after my shift, I sat with him, and we had a great time. It was like we had been friends for years. I, at the time, was with Sebastian. Eventually, me and Sebastian broke up, and Tray and I got together literally two weeks after. It was a 7 month relationship with Sebastian, and I know that was a bad decision on my part. I should’ve waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the main story, Tray, Felix, and I started smoking together. I don’t know how to explain it, but for some reason when Tray smokes, he just loses control of himself. He’s either nonverbal, or he can’t hold a conversation because he’s just making stupid jokes and comments that don’t have anything to do with the conversation. He does this during every conversation, including the serious ones. Oftentimes, when we smoke together, Felix tells us about how he’s feeling in his relationship and seeks help and advice from us. While Felix is venting and looking for support, Tray is interrupting to make a stupid comment, related or unrelated, or a joke that isn’t at all appropriate for the conversation. I find this to be very unattractive. You don’t lose control of yourself from smoking the herb, especially if you’ve been smoking consistently for a while, so he is more than able to act right in those moments. I’ve even brought it to his attention because it caused a rift in our relationship, and nothing has really changed. I can tell it upsets Felix sometimes by the way he responds and the look on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second I started smoking with Tray it just all went downhill honestly. I feel like I saw another version of him. A more real version of him. After I realized how unattractive and frustrating it really was, everything snowballed. I started to notice other things that I didn’t like. I ended up talking to him and telling him everything that was bothering me. The way he shut down and wouldn’t talk for HOURS when we had issues. Literally would sit there in silence for hours until I said something, even if he was in the wrong. He wouldn’t talk, wouldn’t touch me, wouldn’t even move unless he had to. 9 times out of 10, when we had a problem, it ended with me fuming and him sleeping because he would just sit there silently until he fell asleep. I told him I missed being single. I told him I needed an emotionally strong man. Not someone that cowers when I’m frustrated or shuts down or gives me sad eyes or anything like that. I told him I needed someone that wasn’t so soft with me all the time. I don’t always want to be loved on. I grew up, not only in abusive households, but with a very stoic and manly father. While my dad (40M) is a HORRIBLE person, outside of the abuse, he is the perfect man. Strong, protective of his family, successful, smart, handy, etc. I want that in a man. I made sure to tell him that there’s nothing wrong with him being a soft person, it’s just not what I need in a relationship. I told him that it’s his choice. I told him that I did not want him to change if he felt like it wasn’t worth it or he didn’t want to. I also told him that, I’m the one that wants him to change these things, so I’ll be here for him throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "That pretty much catches us up to now. The other day, we were on the way to pick up Felix. I saw a turtle in the road, stopped, went to go move it, saw it was half crushed, but alive, called my mom, took it home, put it in a box, and when I went to get in my car, I handed him the box. When I went to hand him the box, he started complaining and I immediately cut him off and said “Can you not?” because he already had an attitude about the detour. I started driving and said “I’m sure you’d want someone to fucking help you if you were half crushed in the middle of the road unable to do anything.” He then said that he just didn’t want to have to hold the box, which to me is so unattractive and makes me feel disgusted towards him. There’s a half crushed turtle dying in a box that I’m trying to take to the rehabilitation center TEN FUCKING MINUTES AWAY and you’re gonna cry about having to hold the box? Oh my gosh. Maybe it’s because he grew up more in town and I grew up in the country, so I love animals, but that behavior is so gross to me. That was strike one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike two happened when he didn’t take me to prom. I’ve been waiting to go to prom since my brother (21M) won prom king and queen with his girlfriend that he is still with and has been with since 7th grade. I’ve never really liked school dances. They’re crowded, hot, loud, my feet always end up hurting, finding a dress is always a pain, but the people are great. I’m a tomboy and I always have been, so when I’m given the opportunity to dress up and look all pretty, I LOVE to take it. Especially when I have a handsome guy to stand next to and look good with. Tray and I went to homecoming together, he told me he was going to ask me to prom, but then one day Felix asked if we were going and Tray said no. I was so upset. Either way, we didn’t end up going, and I’m honestly still devastated. Why wouldn’t you want to go to a dance with your girlfriend and show her off? I don’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike three happened last night. 2 days ago, Tray and I were going to make buckeyes together. We didn’t end up doing it, so yesterday we went to the store and I spent $20 on the ingredients. We got to my house, and Tray didn’t do anything to help with the first half of the buckeyes (making the peanut butter balls). He just sat on a chair playing a game or something on his phone after he finished eating the strawberry cobbler my mom had made. When it came time to do the second half of the project, (melting the chocolate and dipping the pb balls) he again just sat on his phone while I melted the chocolate. Then, I dipped the first ball into the chocolate, twisted it around, picked it up, let it drip a little, and before I could even set it down, he says from behind me “Okay I’ve seen you do one” and then literally just left. Didn’t say anything else, didn’t come back, nothing. Just left me to do the rest of them myself. Didn’t even at the very least stay to talk to me. Never came in to check and see how I was doing, never yelled from the other room, literally nothing. I finally finished them after about half an hour and went out into the living room, which is the room he was in, to wait for the chocolate to solidify. I wasn’t mad or anything despite his previous actions, so I sat with him and turned on a movie. He didn’t watch any of the movie either, he just fell asleep. I just continued watching the movie until it was time to try a completed buckeye. I woke him up, asked him if he wanted one, and he didn’t answer me. I asked multiple times, no answer. I decided to just get up and grab two. One for both of us. I handed him his, and he eventually took a bite. Didn’t say anything about it, didn’t thank me, didn’t anything, but whatever, because he was eating it. The rest of it was just sitting in his hand and he was falling asleep again, so I started trying to wake him up, but he kept falling back asleep, so I said “Tray, you need to wake up baby,” and he finally stood up. I had told him about 3 times already that he needed to eat the rest of the buckeye because it was going to melt. He incoherently said something in a distressed/annoyed/whining voice. I told him again that he needed to eat it because it was going to melt, and he turned around and started walking to the kitchen. Confused, I followed him. I asked what he was doing, but I didn’t get a response. He just continued walking, until he got to the trash can, where he threw the buckeye away. I said “What are you doing?!,” very frustrated at this point as I hadn’t caught an attitude and had been extremely sweet to him the entire time up to this point. He said that it was melting, which immediately pissed me off even more because I had told him multiple times it was going to melt if he didn’t eat it faster. I just turned around, went upstairs, put my boots on, grabbed my keys, and walked out of the house. I sat in the car until he came out of the house and got in the car. I took him home, and when we got there, I had my car still in drive, with my foot on the brake waiting for him to get out. Usually I park my car so I can relax and talk to him a little and properly tell him bye, but when I’m frustrated, I leave it in drive so I can just leave. He didn’t move, eventually asking me what was wrong, so I put my car in park, looked at him, and brought up everything he had done. He apologized, but it didn’t mean anything to me. He also said “You could’ve told me what to do” which immediately infuriated me. I was already doing everything that we were supposed to be doing together and now he wants me to control his actions too? His Face ID is in my phone, he was watching me look at the instructions on my phone. He could’ve put in a little effort to just look at the fucking phone, especially since that’s what he was going to do anyway when he sat down to play on his. At some point, nobody had said anything so I asked him what he was doing. He said he was thinking of something to say and I said there’s nothing to be said. He said something else that I can’t remember and then I said “We’re just sitting here in silence, and my car is running. I want to go home” he grabbed all of his stuff, muttered something that I didn’t hear, and then slammed the fuck out of my car door for some reason. He knows that I don’t like my doors being slammed for multiple reasons. It’s bad for the doors, I got yelled at for it growing up so it’s very triggering, and it’s really loud in the car, especially because I have sensitive hearing and noises like that are very sharp to me. I was shocked at what he’d just done, so I sat there for a few seconds before driving off. He texted me this morning saying “I firstly want to apologize for not doing anything to help you make the buckeyes, I just didnt know how to make them and i wasn’t thinking and started wandering but thats not an excuse for me to not stay with you to at least talk to you. I am sorry for throwing your buckeye out because i didn’t want it, its not that it was bad i just didn’t want it and didn’t say that. I also want to apologize for slamming your door, as much as i meant to, it was wrong of me to do when I made you upset.” “And good morning, i love you and cant wait to see you later” I don’t know what to do or say because I don’t forgive him in the slightest, and a big part of me wants to break up with him.\n",

      "TLDR: I (17F) don’t like the way my boyfriend (18M) has been acting and treating me and other things lately. He’s complained about having to hold a box that had a half crushed, but alive turtle in it while I drove to the rehab center, didn’t take me to prom, and left me to make a dessert that we were supposed to make together, by myself. (Not all in the same day) After the dessert was finished, I gave him some, and he didn’t give me any feedback. Just took one small bite, complained that it was melting after I told him it was going to if he didn’t eat it faster, and threw it away. Then he slammed my car door because I was upset that he threw my dessert away.\n",

      "Body text:  Boyfriend [36M] unsure of relationship with me [30F] after almost a year. When we started dating a year ago he told me that he is looking for marriage and children and that is his goal. After maybe 8 months he left me due to his mental health and not being able to meet my needs. We seperate for a couple months and he came back telling me he feels a lot better and is ready to put me as a priority and I gave him another chance. He is in the military is supposed to be moving to another country for years in 5 months and asked me to basically get married come with him and live with him there. I would be uprooting my whole life and my career to go but I agreed because that’s what love is. Now after one and half months being back together again, I posed the question of where he is at in the relationship and why he isn’t really making any plans or helping me plan for moving. (And also is never saying he’s excited). He basically answered with that he’s unsure of me again and unsure he can handle a marriage and put others first above him (me and future kids). He brought up a long distance relationship from that country instead of committing to me. He also brought him “let’s just wait a little longer to see if I’m unsure still”. I left. Is he showing a clear example of him stringing me along?\n",

This was literally a conversation today. we were talking normally about how i dont have to like the people that he spoke about me to cuz they formed an opinion on me without actually talking to me (which he says im egotistical and self centred for saying so) and he rose his voice to the point that the app we were talking on cut off a few words cuz of the change in volume. \n",

      "no matter how hard i try to communicate, it feels like it goes in one ear and out the other. he says that im trying to be manipulative by saying anything or defending myself and he calls me a narcissist. he dictates what im upset about and then yells at me for it. again i am in no means innocent. i have yelled, started fights, cussed back at him. but it feels like for every attack i throw, he launches an army at me. i see him posting about me in other subreddit and he sends me screenshots from the bpd servers where he spoke about us and letting people talk shit about me when ive been so worried to talk to anyone cuz it wouldnt be fair to only tell my side of things but im at my wits ends here.  \n",

I have done so much for this person that i really dont know who i am anymore. I had to beg for everything in this relationship too, from personal time to time with him. its hard to see eye to eye anymore. its hard to get a word in. he says im a red flag for not trying in the relationship but it really feels like his version of me trying is sitting there to accept whatever hurtful word he throws my way and apologizing.\n",

      "\n",
      "One recurring issue is the way we remember things differently. Often, when something goes wrong, he tells the story in a way that makes it sound like I lashed out for no reason. But to me, those moments had build-up. I’m not saying I handled them well — I didn’t. I can own that. I didn’t always deescalate. I’ve interrupted. I’ve reacted before thinking. I have a hard time stopping myself when I feel overwhelmed or triggered. But I also know that the way he tells the story and reorders the details and context — things like a certain tone, a dismissive remark, or a pattern of behavior that led to my reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says I didn’t bring up  important issues when they needed to be discussed. But I was scared. Not necessarily of him — but of how loud things would get, how quickly the energy would shift, how I’d have to brace myself even if the yelling wasn’t directed at me. It still felt threatening. It’s hard to open up and speak calmly when your body feels like it’s in fight or flight. I didn’t stay silent because I didn’t care. I stayed silent because I was overwhelmed, trying to avoid escalation, or already shutting down emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also says I was wrong or dramatic for not being able to get over the yelling or the raised tone — even if he was just excited. But my nervous system doesn’t care if it’s anger or excitement. It just hears *volume* and reacts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, I’ve started to doubt myself. Did it happen that way? Am I rewriting things to suit my emotions? But I don’t think that’s it. I think I’m trying to hold on to the full picture — not just the part where I lose my cool, but everything that led to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again I haven’t always responded kindly. I’ve been passive-aggressive. I’ve escalated situations. I’ve cut in. I’ve pushed when maybe I should’ve paused. I take responsibility for that. I’m not trying to frame myself as a victim. I’m trying to be honest about the complexity.\n",

      "What I’m struggling with now is how much of what I feel is real, and how much of it has been worn down by constant self-questioning. He’s not a bad person. But am i abusive? am i truly the most ugly person he has ever encountered? he says he's only here cuz he doesn't have the self-respect to think he can get better. What can i do? i don't want to leave this man, how do i become better when the history is so tainted and I have 0 support and working with a scared ticking time bomb?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend (recently diagnosed with BPD) and I have had a very emotionally intense relationship for 2+ years. I stayed through the yelling, threats, and emotional volatility, and eventually started reacting with anger too. I’ve done things wrong — been passive-aggressive, escalated fights, struggled with accountability — and I’m trying to work on that. But his words have been deeply cruel, and his therapist thinks I’m the abusive one. I’m trying to figure out: am I really the abuser here, or just someone who's been worn down over time? I don’t want to paint myself as innocent, I just need clarity on what’s really happening.\n",

      "Body text: Hey. \\[I am M, a College Freshman, 20\\] is in a complex dynamic with another \\[M, Freshman, 20\\] right now. I’m lowkey confused. Age similarities because both Ms took gap years, and F is Soph (below)\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarise, around orientation, our friend group started off as three, because I met \\[M, Freshman\\] and then invited \\[F, Sophomore, 20\\] to hang out. Six weeks in, I had a gut feeling and started to realize that the two of them were unknowingly leaving me out, because they were texting separately and are now dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, M also starts being mean to me, and suspects that I am interested in him, as a defensive mechanism to push me away. (I clarified and have mentioned in passing before that I’m straight, I just prefer 1-1 hang outs in our friendship, partly because I feel left out).\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven weeks in, we talk it out since I found out they are now dating. M talks to me about what he feels, I tell him about how he made me feel as a friend, and we ‘talk’ it out. Everything seems ok, albeit awkward. I told him I’m in college and I want to be tight with someone, hustle and grind together. I don’t want to be taken for granted in a friendship, and I feel left out in the group of 3, and don’t think I’d want to hang out in groups of 3 ever again, because it just felt like M and F was using me to get close to each other. He apologises, and asks me to give him a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today, things seem pretty messy. It’s kinda like how trust is broken and can never be the same? I don’t hate him per se, but I enjoy hanging out with him. I have other friends and hang out, but I feel like I don’t get the same prioritization from him per se. Ever since we had the first conversation, he has been putting in effort and trying to be better, but it still feels lacklustre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last semester, I hate how when I ask to hang out he’ll always say no and say he has X Y Z things planned. So to make up for this uncertainty he suggests we meet at a same predetermined time every week. Sounds fair, but this is a major cut down from how often we used to meet \\[either just me, or with me and F\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "Also it’s kind of like a weird dynamic? He tries to bring us \\[me and F\\] together, but I just have no interest. I think F is manipulative, and sort of try to befriend me then to get close to M, but on the surface we just remain cordial. So what happens then is that it creates a weird dynamic where he has to choose between me or F. Which even though I wish we’d spent more time together \\[separately\\], I told him I understand and have also told him to go hang out with F at parties or at events where we’re both there together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m okay and I’m happy with him being with F, but what pisses me off is him making it so obvious that I’m not a priority? Like I asked M to hang out with me at one party, and he said no, he’s going with F. But when he found out that F is going to that same party but with her friends, he finally wants to hang out with me. This is what gets me, and it’s something that I just cannot tolerate (or rather, have tried to, but it gets to me).\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think I should do? Just distance myself slowly? Or talk it out? If we do talk it out it’s like our third or fourth time talking it out. This is like a major summarised version but yes. Also I do have other friends, I just love and appreciate M’s company when things do work out, but it’s just pmo because of this not prioritising situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, I know this is a lot, but its just been a confusing moment in life? I don't hate them, it's just that after I found out they got together (partly because of me? but excluded me) F gives me the ick, and Ms' behavior just gets me. I realize and reflect that this might also be an avoidant (him) vs anxious (me) attachment style?\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I suspected M and F used me to get together, which ended up being true. F gives me ick, so I distance, and M apologises for being mean to me. Over time, our priorities and expectations change, so there's a conflict about mismatch in expectations and prioritization. Do I hold on or let go? Or fade?\n",

      "Body text: So my girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) recently got back together after dating for a year and breaking up. Since getting back together, things have been rocky—we argue about small things almost daily, and it’s really starting to wear me down.\n",

      "After our breakup, she started dating another guy. During that time, one of her friends got into a serious accident. My best friend, who was dating that injured friend, posted photos and wrote supportive messages about her.

      "\n",
      "For context, I usually do try to be in her corner. I listen to both sides, but I almost always try to understand and support her.

      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My GF (18F) and I (18M) got back together recently, but we’ve been arguing constantly. She’s now mad at me for not defending her during a fight she had with my best friend while we were broken up and she was dating someone else.

      "Body text: Dated this girl for 3 months and it was insane. Best relationship I ever had, so passionate and intimate. We both liked each other a lot and connected so well. She just broke up with me. Caught me blindsided, she had some issues with me not “opening up to her” about some things I was dealing with. The two main issues she had was she hadn’t met my parents yet (yes 3 months is still pretty new) but her argument was I already knew hers from early on. And she said she knew I was going through something but didn’t know what until I finally did open up about the complications with my mom’s cancer. She felt horrible for me, but tried to say this whole time she involved me with every aspect of her life and this whole time I left her in the dark. She felt like I was hiding something. I explained that I’m slow to fully trust anymore, I used to put blind trust in people early in the past and it’s always backfired. I told her I’d bring her home to meet the folks and assured her I had nothing to hide. My friends take on this was that she sounds manipulative but I really didn’t get that impression (being in the full context) yeah I did have some fault in all of this and I realize it now. A week later she broke up with me. She said she needs to work on getting over some problems from her past and needed to be alone. She said I needed to work on things too. She mentioned that she does “really really like me” and that I make her so happy but she just “can’t do this right now” when we broke up we talked for 3 hours. It was a very emotional conversation, we both heard each other. Neither of us got mad or lost our cool. We even shared a few laughs. She left it at, “Not never but not now, maybe we can try being friends and ease back into things after I have some time to myself” \n",
      "When she left we exchanged a very long hug. \n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify I am 95% positive she is not going to be talking to or entertaining other men during this time but I did not ask. I am going to give her some space in the hopes that she soon comes around and reaches out. I truly believe we moved too fast and things got real fast and it scared her. I figured I’ll give it 6 ish weeks and if I haven’t heard back I might reach out and see if she wants to catch up over coffee. She even went as far as to say I can still txt or call when I’m having a bad day and she doesn’t want me out of her life. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m still just confused about the whole situation but I understood her well and I somewhat understand why she feels the way she does… I just would have though she’d try to work through things together with how well we connected.

      "Body text: (TLDR at bottom)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I 14NB and my ex-best friend 15F haven't spoken outside of professionalism in 3 months. Since we share classes and clubs there is still the occasional question or request, but nothing personal. (Except for today but I'll get to that later) I don't necessarily want to fix things, that ship has sailed, but I do want to find closure for both of our sakes, our anxiety and our parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all started around spring break, where we both went on vacation, me to Europe and her to Japan. Over the course of our 2 week vacations we texted for avg over 1 hour per day. In addition to this, there was also common facetime calls to check in on each other. Now, I had literally never had anyone care about me this much (or seem to anyways) basically ever, not anyone I had ever considered a best friend, not therapists, not my parents. And, that's at no fault of their own, they are all good people but you know how teens are with there parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, during these 2 weeks I started to develop a pretty big crush on her, and I showed it in my texting, being pretty obvious, flirting, calling her cute, VERY clear messaging. And, at the time at least, I thought it was being reciprocated. She responded in kind, flirtatious jokes, messages, subtleties, etc. And I may not be the best at social cues but she was reciprocating I swear But, I thought I was crazy so I asked my sisters, one of whom being a practiced \"Flirt\". (Her words not mine). And, both of them told me that there was a near certain chance that she liked me. So, I set out to tell her, arranging a time the Monday after we returned (AKA the first day of school back). And this was my first mistake. Jet lag, other problems she had that I literally had no way of knowing about and I guess more problems we both had lead to what was, verbally, the perfect confession. Unfortunately, verbally isn't just how things work. I may have said the right words, but through the tears, the pauses and the timings in which I said them made it worse than the time I got my friend to tell someone I liked that I liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assumed (since I thought I knew this girl it was literally the perfect friendship) that it'd take a few days, maybe a week for her to come to terms with it and that we could then start being friends again, starting slowly and moving up to something more, well, friendly. I knew I could do this as one of the only things I am good at is moving on from being rejected, and I was over it in like 3 days. What I was not over however, was the fact that I thought I had hurt her so effing badly. She hadn't come to school in a week, wasn't replying to my texts asking if she was okay. For all I knew, she was dead. So, after like a week of me spending all day on my bed crying my eyes out (again, not cause of the rejection, cause I was scared I had hurt her) I shot her another text essentially saying that \"Its pretty fucking clear you hate me know, I just want to make sure you're okay and then you don't have to talk to me ever again\". And, I waited. Waited for a while. I sent a follow-up \"I know I hurt you and I just want to say that I'm here if you need me and I want you to feel better about *everything.* Now we come to my next mistake. Because she had told me she wanted space but my anxiety ridden brain was telling me \"You caused a problem so fix it you asshole\". So, I did. I kept texting her, bi-daily, until my thick head finally got the message. Something that also helped me get the message was her calling me selfish, despite the only thing I wanted for myself was for her to feel better?? Still genuinely confused abt that. So, I sent one final text, leading with \"This will be my final contact unless you reply. I know when I am not wanted. Insert me saying I'm here if she needs me, not here if she isn't, that I just want to help, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, she told me that she did still want to be friends and just wanted to take it slowly. So I did. I stopped texting her, I went back to school and I was normal, I talked to her if I saw her but was careful not to overstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "FF 2 months ish later and she literally hasn't said a fucking word to me at all. Now, context for this next part, we are both in the yearbook club and since I had a free block and I saw a couple of the members (her being one of them), I asked if there was anything I could work on for it. (we are super behind so time is of the essence). The other guy said \"No I don't know\". I then turned to her, asked her the same. Her exact words were \"If I wanted you to do something I probably would just do it myself.\" Obviously a shot. And, a cruel one at that. Not only implying that I'm useless, but that she is better than me at whatever it is I was going to try and do. And, what did I do?? I turned, tears in my eyes (literally) away from her and said \"Thanks\" sarcastically. To no response. Looking back on it now, It would have been much more satisfying to curse her out and call her on all the shit she's put me through. (3 months of literally having 0 people to talk to, not even casually, 3 months of suicidal thoughts, 3 months of my anxiety spirally like nothing else, 2 months of depression controlling me, 3 months of me being an asshole to everyone I know, 3 months of contemplating how many of my other relationships were so fragile that a couple of texts could break them, 3 months of pain.)

Basically tensions were high from a fight the previous day and I told him if we are going to hang out I don’t want to fight because it’s my first weekend off in 3 months. He agreed. That same night we went out to the store and he was being mopey and I asked what’s wrong. He said we should really talk about the fight. I said I wil talk about it but I don’t want to fight and will only talk about it if he is willing to listen to my side and not become defensive. He wasn’t too thrilled I said this and did not really agree or disagree. He never brought it up. That night we were watching a movie and I put subtitles on a movie and I noticed they were in French and he was trying to get the pause sign to go away and moved the mouse. I also noticed at the same time it’s in French and said move and switched to English. He said it’s crazy that I put the subtitles on without asking him and demanded I take them off because he hates subtitles. He said “you don’t just go to someone’s house and touch their computer and put subtitles on”.  I replied what about me? Because  I have a hard time watching movies without subtitles and this has been going on for 5 years. I was honestly shocked he said that and just let it go but watched the movie in silence and went to bed. Fast forward to the next morning I wanted to tell him why I wasn’t being affectionate due to the previous nights events. He immediately blew up and went on about how I’m wrong for touching the computer. I said I don’t want to argue as it’s my weekend off and he kept going so I said I want to leave. He needed to drive me home and told me to get my sister to come pick me up. He kept emphasizing how what I did is as if I go into a car and turn the ac on, and that that is the drivers job, and how turning the subtitles on is the same idea and he would never do that. I said that I am his gf of 5 years I should be treated a bit different than a stranger. He kinda got it but he laughed while I cried, said I’m unbearable and fucked up and that I shouldn’t talk to him ever again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now he has avoidant tendencies and has a lot of criticism coming from his parents so I get he’s under pressure to any type of criticism lately. However, I do not want to tolerate this kind of fighting anymore because it happens far too often, and I won’t be called names. \n",
      "I ended up leaving his house before 9am and walking to a store to have my sister pick me up. We haven’t spoken since and I’m not sure what to make of this and how to reach out eventually if I do. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; my bf and I of 5 years got into a fight over subtitles and our communication has been very bad lately. I left his house because of the ridiculous nature of the fight and we haven’t spoken since. \n",

      "Title: how to get over (worst scenario) first love\n",
      "Body text: not gonna go through the entire thing-  but short story- i’m 4 years younger than him and was completely inexperienced while he is VERY experienced (we are both legal don’t worry) so it started him pursuing me, very innocently. the entire time, he was gentle and did everything innocently with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "i knew we could never amount to anything because he would be graduating and i just started. we’d go our separate ways in a few months and it’d be over. (college btw). but, you know how it goes. \n",
      "\n",
      "skip forward, he’s seen me now without my clothes, did sexual things (not sex yet and he never forced me), asked me to be his girlfriend, bought me flowers, cuddled me, surprised me all the time. he told me how he “wanted to show me what a beautiful smart and pretty girl deserved” he wanted to be the best and set the standard. \n",
      "then. i found out he had a girlfriend at home. he has been on and off with her, but they were currently dating. he tried to break up with her after meeting me but didn’t finish breaking up when the girl tried to save the relationship, so he continued but it was dead (confirmed by both him and the girl) and they finally broke up after i found out. still was mega depressed. but because i’d done so many things with him i’ve never done i was so heartbroken, i missed him deeply. he showed me over and over he was desperate to fix things so i agreed to at least allow him to tell me what happened after being cold for a few days, and gradually i warmed back up to him because it felt too impossible to be mad. now we were back to dating but without the label. he knew i was upset and i can tell he views me as someone innocent and small and it hurts to know this. i’ve never gone through a single part of this good or bad relationship stuff before. i knew he was bad, but i knew he loved me, he did things you only do when you’re truly in love, came to my window in the middle of the night and we’d sneak out, handmade me a necklace, took me to the hospital and took care of me when i was ill, rocked me back and forth and played with my hair- but i think he also is able to love fast and easily, and im just another person that he loves if that makes sense. \n",
      "he talked about how he would wait for me for years, even just to see my face again once he left. he wanted to continue but i told him we couldn’t. i am still hurt by his lies. \n",
      "and this is bad on me- but because he deceived me, i went through texts on his phone and saw a suspicious text from someone i don’t know, she was saying “i know you want to continue talking but im still trying to get over everything that happened” \n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT???? i didn’t ask because i figured, “why?” this will be over beyond control in a few weeks, but i truly love him. \n",
      "\n",
      "he even texts the now ex-gf i mentioned, but he is so dismissive towards her that you can tell he doesn’t care. which i think says something bad about him, one day he could treat me like that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "the first love is innocent, he has my first everything (we eventually had sex and it was my first time) and he was very comforting to be around. it literally felt like my entire body would slow down with him. had a hard childhood with strict parents, and i felt so safe and warm under his arm. he graduated and we still text and im finding it difficult to stop talking to him, he calls me daily. i respond. also to find the strength not to be depressed, not to care what he’s doing, and not to let this ruin me like it’s been doing. i feel dead inside. it’s over and im holding onto nothing but i can’t let go. i cannot do it and i seriously feel like i will spiral into *serious* depression if i do. help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also- i’ve always been very independent, top of my class kind of girl, etc. but now i feel like i NEED him. (i can’t even if i wanted to. he’s graduated. remember this is college not high school, we don’t live in the same town this happened over the course of a year at school) \n",

      "Body text: I (17F) have been with my long distance boyfriend (17M) for just over 9 months now and I feel like my overthinking and mental health are starting to take over the relationship. I have always been the kind of person to overthink and worry due to past relationship issues and the ways I have been treated in the past. However, over these past couple months I have noticed that my mental state and worrying has played a huge part on what is happening during our time together. I have recently been catching him out on little things such as a girl messaging, and flirting with him but there was no messages back, or deleted ones, and also today I found out that he had messaged my ex best friend (16F) behind my back as we have had a huge argument and fell out. But I’ve never overthought as much as I have been recently. I feel as though my thoughts are becoming too much for him as he is now very easily irritable and also getting really annoyed when I ask him anything about him hating me, or him getting bored of me. I understand some can find this annoying, but he has never been like this before, I feel as though it is somewhat tearing us apart. (I have been receiving help for my personal mental issues)\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my partner for almost 7 years. We have a young son together. And I feel like I’m stuck in a situation where every possible path forward comes at a cost - either to the people I love, or to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, we had sex multiple times a day. It was passionate and connected. My libido has always been high. This isn’t something new or out of the blue. I’ve always been upfront about my needs for physical and emotional closeness. Before this relationship, I even dated in the swinging community. I’ve never hidden this side of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But about four years ago, her libido disappeared. It’s not that she doesn’t want sex with me. She’s said she doesn’t want it at all. She doesn’t feel sexual desire anymore, even solo. She’s also withdrawn from physical affection more broadly. She doesn’t like kissing on the lips or being touched in intimate ways. That’s her boundary, and I want to respect that. She deserves to feel safe, not pressured.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I miss that connection. I miss being kissed. Touched. Desired. Not just sexually, but emotionally too. I want to feel wanted, held, close to someone. I want to feel like I matter in that way.\n",

      "When I try to bring it up, it’s uncomfortable for both of us.

I have a high libido and deep emotional need for closeness. I don’t want to pressure her, cheat, or leave and repeat the trauma of my father abandoning our family. But I don’t want to lose myself either. I’ve tried finding support, but couples counselling that’s neurodiverse-affirming feels almost impossible to access. What now?\n",

I sleep peacefully worrying about nothing and wake up happily to a new day … so for nearly 15 years I guess, right from when is was in 4th grade .. my dad became alcoholic and he used to come home very very late like 2am or 3am in the morning in drunk state talking in a very abusive way to my mom and talking same shit past story for 3-4 hours and not letting anyone sleep until he sleeps .. this is continously happening till date and it includes occasionally beating my mum .. I have been facing this since my childhood and I used to feel embarrassed because of him in public places , family gatherings and also my school as he would talk like a shit to my friends ..\n",

As an elder one and the one with so much love for my mum .. I stood up against him .. stayed awake until he slept and protected my mom … during these mess . Sometimes it used to get soo bad that we had to call neighbour uncles for help as we all are women and couldn’t handle him . He does this for a week and then next week he becomes alright and again the same pattern continues till date .. whenever I was in my home country I used to not sleep peacefully everyday getting scared how he would come.. also there is not even a single family function where I wasn’t scared feeling he would embarrass us .\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I used to confront him he used to talk back and suddenly become extremely mad and try to hit me and my mom used to save me .. there are many days till now where I have prayed to god that he dies and never comes back or I have a nice dad like my friends .. his side of family is total shit back of money and that hurts him clearly .. on the other hand my moms side of family is very helpful and very close knit .. I’m not sure if this is bothering this fucker.. he keeps messing each and every family function in my moms side or every function or special occasion like birthday or wedding day by coming home late like an asshole and making an issue ..\n",

      "Throughout our friendship, he voiced that he liked me but I didn’t really see him as anything more than a friend. Idk the physical attraction wasn’t really there- I didn’t get butterflies and jitters and the thought of maybe dating him wasn’t all that appealing. He said he was fine being just friends. That was over a year ago and I thought we were good, but I could feel that by the beginning of this year that he really didn’t want to just be friends. I, of course, ignored those signs hoping that I was just wrong and reading into something that wasn’t there. \n",

      "Body text: Okay so for context we've been dating for about  half a year and everything has gone smoothly expect for this aspect of our life. Sexual things are very touchy for me as if since I have trauma from it, and already get easily triggered. Thankfully I'm able to tell him when I dont want to, and we usually do it 2-3 times a week. But early into the months I've noticed he's starting not to want to reciprocate anything. I dont mean like he doesnt want to do a certain action - I mean he just doesnt want to touch me back at ALL. We dont do penetration since neither of us enjoy it, but other than that he wants me to go round after round with pleasuring him. If I make any hint that I want something back or at least  want something done together (without being pushy), he gets weird about it and just asks me to please him again. It makes me feel objectified. I've brought this up to him another time and he said he feels bad. I thought maybe its a sexual preference so I asked him \"okay, can you just me more romantic with me then\" (kissing me more, telling me he loves me lots, reassuring me, etc). he said he would but he never does. He says he promises we'll spend time together without intimacy soon but we never do. It's getting to the point where I dont even want to do it with him anymore; if its not me getting triggered by the act itself, its me getting triggered by him not even seeming to care about me during it. I need help on how to get through to him, because he seems not to be understanding how this make me feel.\n",

      "Body text: Hello reddit, this is a very weird situation so I’ll try to tell it as simply as possible:\n",
      "Note: english is not my first language, so sorry for all the errors and mistakes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: I 20F and my boyfriend 20M have been dating for four years now, and living together for 1,5 years. I’ve had quite a share of trauma in life, which led to me starting therapy when I was about 15 years old, and I still go weekly to this day. I am autistic and have had an OCD diagnosis for a few years, but it’s medicated and quite well controlled nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend however was raised by a therapist mom and a nonchalant father, which made his whole childhood and teenage years to be full of questions after questions after questions about his feelings. The thing is, his mom never did the questioning thing correctly, so every time my boyfriend would show any type of emotion ever, she would bombard him with questions like ”Are you anxious? Are you suicidal? Are you feeling mad at me?” Like in EVERY situation possible. So many times when she would ask him to even do a simple chore and he would say ”I’ll do it in a second” or something, she never just let it be and had to question his every feeling and motivation for anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "This worked maybe when he was younger and learning to identify his emotions, but when he became a teenager and maybe didn’t want to tell everything to his parents, he just learnt to shut the emotions down, bottle them up and then burst them out in anger at some point. \n",
      "Because of this he doesn’t want to show nearly any emotion with his parents, and even loving gestures, touches or words aren’t okay to show from me when we are with his parents. When we are with my parents, we both show eachother normal love like we would do at home or anywhere really, so it’s not just that he doesn’t want others to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, he had a mental health crisis when he was about seventeen, and I helped him along with his parents getting him some therapy, but only for a few months. I don’t know what he talked about with the therapist, but I feel like it was not a right fit for him, as he just stopped going and said he didn’t need it anymore.\n",
      "\n",

It was so fun and I felt so lucky, but I also learned that my 'best friend' was asked to help plan and basically she was being rude, short and didn't participate in the party planning. She also didn't show up which I was hurt by. we had gone out earlier in the week to celebrate my birthday, so it's not like she forgot, but I thought it was so mean of her to a. be rude to my family and b. bail on the planning and not show up at all.

      "Body text: I'm running into a slight etiquette issue with a friend of ours! As a friend group of 5+ years, we love watching movies, shows, etc. and talking about them - and who doesn't? Generally, we have a really good time. However, one of our friends (27M) is a little *less* great at having these discussions. He'll pretty frequently come to a gathering or our group chat with a very strong, somewhat poorly thought-out opinion - think \"*the whole message of* All Quiet on the Western Front *was that war is hard, but worth it*.\" (Not a real example, but very *very* close to one.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I know you can only trust my word on this, but our group is really civil - we never go \"what?!\" or berate him or anything. We engage with what he says seriously, even when we have to be honest and tell him we really disagree. These discussions often lead to a lot of backpedaling and shifting goalposts whenever we try to point out that a claim of his doesn't hold a lot of water - while he doesn't get angry or defensive, and he *does* admit he's in the wrong, it seems to take him a *lot* longer (think hours or days) to get there, and we end up beating dead horses for a long time whenever he's included in a media-related discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has become *really* un-fun for most of us in the group - we love talking about media together, and we enjoy lively debates, but it's gotten frustrating over the years to have fun conversations get actively derailed by having to explain very basic media literacy/criticism things to this friend. The kicker to all of this: he *loves* these discussions. He's said to us multiple times things like, \"I really missed being on the debate team in high school - this is really fun, you guys!\" and really feels that our conversations have been mutually enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this friend, and I'm *very* glad he's getting a lot out of our conversations - but I'm struggling to know how to approach the growing annoyance. It feels incredibly rude and/or pointed to just say, \"Actually, I didn't have a lot of fun. I felt like we were all defending a relatively obvious thing to you, and you keep backpedaling when we show you reasons why you're wrong,\" but most of our group really does feel that way. Does anyone have any tips for being gracious while engaging with someone who's just not the greatest at these conversations? I absolutely don't want him to feel discounted or upset, but I worry resentment will start growing if we can't talk about how difficult it often is to \"debate\" with him.\n",

      "Body text: I expressed I felt that it felt impersonal because it feels like it is a routine, and especially when he needs to finish it has to in a *very* specific position, down to every detail of even having his head over my left shoulder his head buried in the pillow. When I tried to have him switch his head over the other shoulder he couldn’t get back into it. When we had an open conversation, I asked why he felt it had to end this way. He responded with “I just have to get into the right head space, where I feel safe, I’m with my person and I don’t have any distractions”, while I don’t want him to feel anything less then safe and feel like he is with his person, it does feel very disconnecting that he can’t look at me and almost have a moment all about him rather then it connecting us closer. Asking a little further, seems like this has been consistent, as in he had to be in this position to get to his end to, further drove the point that this is not about connecting together through sex just simply needing to block out distractions “like your boobs”, to be able to get in the right headspace to cum. I just want to gain some other people’s perspective, advice or things we can try to help both of us. He wants to try but when we tried to have sex again without going into that position he wasn’t able to cum because he’s too in his head which I understand because of the situation above, but I just want to help this situation move forward because if we continue this I just feel like I’m the same routine he followed with his past partners and I’m more like a quick means to an end\n",

      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",

      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",

      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

      "Body text: TLDR: Should my girlfriend be invited to UFC nights even tho it has previously always been a night for the guys and most of the people there are single guys?\n",
      "\n",
      "This may sound childish but my gf is really angry and I don’t know if she is being childish or if perhaps I am. My girl has recently been begging to be invited to hangouts with my friends and begging me to go to hers, I’ve been hosting UFC nights for all my boys for the past few years now, every time there is a ufc card fight night or ppv we are chillin in my basement. Most of the guys are single, but me and one other guy have gfs. Now my girl has recently been telling me that she thinks its important she gets to know my friends better and that she deserves to be invited to whatever I am doing with my friends once in a while. For the most part I agree and I told her that we will organize some double dates or some other activities where the girls will be invited. She was not happy and for some reason just wouldn’t let up. So last saturday I caved and she came to ufc night at mine. My other friends girl was busy that night, so she was the only girl there. other than greetings and small talk nobody really talked to her and she mostly just stuck to me. Fast forward 2 days and my friend told his girl that everyone found it awkward that she was there, and felt like they couIdn’t really act like themselves. I am sure that nobody said that, and he is just telling that to his girl so that she doesn’t want to come in the future. I know it sounds fucked but that guy is fucked in the way he treats/manipulates his girl. However now his girl told my girl and she really isnt happy. She thinks its extremely mean on my friends part to have even said that, and when i told her that nobody said that she just tells me that they obviously wouldnt tell me and that im wrong and they really all felt awkward because of her. Now shes saying she never wants to come again and she is really not happy. Personally i never wanted it to be like this but that is honestly exactly what I pictured happening and I really dont see why we can’t just have boys nights once in a while. Im trying to explain to her that since most of my friends are single, nobody wants to be THAT guy bringing his girl to the function and now suddenly nobody can be themselves anymore and its awkward… My friends don’t really know my girl like that so i can understand why her being there made it awkward for them. We have been dating for almost 4 years now and UFC has always just been for the boys. Am I wrong for wanting to have some nights that are just for the guys every once in a while?\n",

      "Title: Girlfriend wants to take a break after I triggered a traumatic memory\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "My (21M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been together for a while, and I really do love her. We’ve had some amazing moments and a strong emotional connection, but we’ve also faced some ongoing challenges that I think are now coming to a head.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a history of trauma — specifically an incident in college where a guy invited her over under the impression they were just going to watch a movie. Instead, he took advantage of her. Cops got involved, but nothing came of it because there wasn’t enough evidence. Since then, she’s understandably had trust and boundary issues. Whenever I’ve tried to talk about it — gently and only when it felt appropriate — she’s always avoided the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also tends to struggle with communication and emotional vulnerability. I know confrontation is difficult for her. When she’s overwhelmed, her go-to is to shut down, go quiet, or pull away. I’ve always tried to be supportive, but this avoidance has made resolving conflict really difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to a few nights ago: she had a headache, and I offered to give her a head massage. She declined and said she’d take ibuprofen instead. I kept insisting — not realizing how much I was pushing her past a boundary. She eventually said “this is getting weird” and went to the bathroom. I didn’t realize at the time, but I had unintentionally triggered a traumatic memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she texted saying she needed space. When I asked if I had done something wrong, she explained that I reminded her of the guy who hurt her — that when I kept pushing past her “no,” it brought her back to that experience. She said she wasn’t directly comparing me to him, but it gave her flashbacks and made her cry in the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt terrible. I texted her that I wanted to talk and really understand, and told her I respect her boundaries and want to make things right. I acknowledged my mistake and said I’d listen more carefully moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening she texted me “hi” — I left it on read, trying to give space. Later that night, she messaged again: “I wanna go on a break.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That hit hard. I’ve been through something like this before, where a past ex asked for a break and then just slowly faded away, leading to a breakup that hurt a lot more because it was dragged out with no closure. So I emotionally replied: “Are you being serious?” And then a follow up message, “If you’re gonna leave me then tell me already, I don’t wanna go through this again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: “I just don’t know what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took an hour and then sent a message saying that I still love her and want to work things out — but if she doesn’t want to be with me anymore, she should be honest. I acknowledged that we’ve both made mistakes, that I’ve done things wrong, and that a serious relationship requires communication, patience, and growth. I also told her that I respect her enough to try, but it feels like she might not respect me enough to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "No response since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve drafted another message since, trying to express that if she truly wants to work things out, we need to talk within the relationship, not take breaks every time things get hard. I even said that if this keeps being the pattern — avoiding problems, emotionally shutting down, leaving me in the dark — then maybe we’re not actually ready for the long-term relationship we said we wanted. But I haven’t sent it. I don’t want to make things worse or chase after someone who isn’t sure they want to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some more context about her:\n",
      "\t•\tShe struggles with emotional processing and often says she needs “space” instead of directly addressing issues. She’s had a past of horrible exes from HS and her first year of college. One cheated on her, another is overly obsessive and manipulative and finds ways to text her despite being blocked on multiple occasions. Another guy was dating her and thought they were in a relationship.\n",
      "\t•\tThis isn’t the first time she’s pulled away when we’ve had a conflict, though this is by far the most serious.\n",
      "\t•\tShe’s avoided other tough conversations in the past — like talking about her trauma, or times she’s felt disconnected — and I’ve always tried to be patient with that.\n",
      "\t•\tThat said, sometimes I feel like I’m doing all the emotional work, and that she leans on avoidance while I’m stuck waiting and wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love her. I still want this to work. But I’m exhausted from the emotional uncertainty and the feeling that I’m more committed to solving problems than she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my questions are:\n",
      "\t•\tShould I give her the space she says she needs and wait to see if she reaches back out?\n",
      "\t•\tShould I send my follow-up message, even if it risks pushing her further away?\n",
      "\t•\tOr should I take this as a sign that we’re just not compatible anymore — that we’re not ready for the kind of relationship we both said we wanted?\n",
      "\n",
      "Any insight would help. I don’t want to make a decision out of fear or hurt, but I also don’t want to keep chasing someone who’s already emotionally walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I (21M) accidentally triggered my girlfriend’s (21F) past trauma by pushing to give her a head massage after she said no. She later said she needed space, then asked for a break. I told her I still love her and want to work things out, but only if we do it within the relationship — not by avoiding problems. She hasn’t responded. I’m torn between giving her space, sending a follow-up message, or accepting that we may not be compatible. Not sure what to do.\n",

      "Body text: Hi Reddit,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend (we’re both 19 now and about 160cm tall). I’ve loved her deeply all this time, and I still do. But I’m at a point where I’m feeling conflicted, frustrated, and unsure how to handle things.\n",
      "When we started dating, she weighed around 58kg (~128lbs), and I was totally fine with that. I’ve never been someone obsessed with looks. But over the years, she’s gained a lot of weight — now she’s about 86kg (~190lbs). I’m not trying to fat-shame her, and I understand that bodies change, but this is starting to affect her health. She’s experiencing knee pain and struggles with things like getting up or moving around easily.\n",
      "She’s been doing what looks like intense workouts (4 times a week) for about 1 year, and from what I can tell, she’s really trying. But despite that, she keeps gaining weight. Every time I try to bring it up — gently, I swear — she gets really upset. Last time, I mentioned that maybe she could try eating just a little less, and she broke down crying and called me an asshole. She said I could never understand what it's like because I’m naturally thin (I weigh 45kg and actually struggle with gaining weight myself).\n",
      "She’s seeing a nutritionist, and she says she’s eating normally and not starving herself. But to be honest, I don’t know how to make sense of it — because if she were truly burning more calories than she consumes, she shouldn’t be gaining weight, right? I’ve tried to explain this without sounding cruel, but it always ends with her in tears or calling me an idiot who just doesn’t understand.\n",
      "So here’s the truth: I feel guilty because I still love her, but I’m also less and less physically attracted to her. Sometimes when I see her undress, I feel kind of grossed out, and that makes me feel like a horrible person. We still have regular sex, and it hasn’t affected that part of our relationship — yet. But I’m worried that over time, this lack of attraction will become a bigger issue.\n",

      "Title: BF (25 M) said I ruined his birthday, I tried. What do I do?\n",
      "Body text: Yesterday was my (25F) bfs (26M) birthday. We’ve been dating nearly 4 years now. I put in good effort for the occasion- I got him three gifts that totaled about $325 and all correlated to his most current hobbies (a cool monster hunter figure imported from japan, merch from his favorite sports team, a glass guitar slide). I baked a cake from scratch, probably the best thing I’ve ever made ngl. I made dinner reservations at a nice place. I just wanted to do it right and make him feel special.\n",
      "\n",
      "He loved the gifts, and we spent the morning having coffee and cake. He told me later he liked the cake so much that it was literally all he ate that day before dinner. We both had work that day, and I had a pretty busy day. I admit I was a little stressed when I got home, but I was excited for dinner and we both got ready and headed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like dinner was where I messed up. It started out fine, and our meals were delicious and we were chatting abt random stuff. But at some point I just kept saying the wrong thing, ig. We were talking about tattoos we wanted, and I accidentally brought up an old incident where he left a family reunion with his siblings to get tats, which ended up taking 8 hours and left me babysitting a bunch of random children alone. He seemed upset, I realized my mistake, and I quickly changed topics. But he clearly was still upset. As soon as we left he wouldn’t talk to me in the car or at home, and all he wanted to do was lay in bed silently scrolling his phone. He didn’t want to be touched either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning he said he was miserable for the entirety of his birthday. That kinda hurt. He seemed happy the previous morning and we had a great convo over coffee. He told me he had an awful day at work, and my irritability when I got home was not okay (I made two comments about food in the sink and the cat peeing on the floor, but I guess I didn’t balance it out with something positive). He said he wasn’t happy with our dinner conversation, and all he wanted on his birthday was to be happy, so I ruined it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I could have done better, but I find it difficult to be the perfect conversationalist. I’m so much better at the gestures, so it always sucks when saying dumb shit ruins it. Most of the birthday posts I’ve seen are the opposite- no effort, forgot, etc. \n",

      "Body text: My bf has a younger sister who, I'll be honest, I'm not very fond of. I think you may understand why after reading the entire post.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is still in college. She kept telling her parents and my bf its because she does sports and had to push back her exams, which sounded pretty sus to me but her family accepted the story and I didn't want to cross any boundaries. Her parents fund her degree and they have been taking her word at face value and paying her tuition all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she had approached her parents and my bf and started bawling. Turns out, she has actually been failing her first year for 7 years straight and hasn't paid her tuition for three years and her college is now threatening to throw her out after years of multiple warnings. When my bf asked where all the money went, she said she used it to travel. She goes to Bali twice a year, lives a very luxurious and expensive lifestyle (she's an aspiring influencer) and lied to her family saying it was from her own money. Turns out, she didn't have a job or any money and just blew her tuition fee on expensive things.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has then asked her parents to give her an allowance (because she's broke and \"couldn't keep living like this\") and for them to pay off all her college arrears. She had then threatened to hurt herself if they didn't do this.\n",

His sister always expects him to pitch in fix her fuck ups. She totaled her car driving drunk twice, and she demanded that he fix it for her both times. And he just...did it. She makes him by her designer stuff he cant afford...and again....he just does it. She is a very entitled and self centered person and my bf and his family enables her behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brushed this off for 3 years now. I always believed it was not my place to comment on their relationship. Their family and I need to know my place. And honestly, my bf is the sweetest, kindest and most loving guy I've met. I value him and cherish him a lot. But the fact that this keeps happening regularly is worrying me. I feel like he doesn't know how to draw boundaries with her and one day, if we get married, he will bankrupt the two of us and our family trying to help her. I initially thought this may be an overreaction but the more and more I see this happening, the more I believe that it is completely possible. I have tried bringing this up with him but he is very protective of his sister and the conversations haven't really gone anywhere.\n",

      "Title: My bf [25M] refuses to marry me [22F] until we’re in our 50’s. I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend now for little over a year. But we ‘dated’ for about a year before becoming official. As the years have passed obviously conversations have popped up such as: what are both our thoughts on having children? when might be the appropriate length of time to move in together? And finally: marriage. We are both in this relationship for the long run, neither of us have ever dated casually and were only looking for long term relationships when we met. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6 months ago, the topic of marriage got brought up for the first time. Not because either of us want to get married now, but because I hope to one day get married in the future (next 10 years). My bf responded by saying something along the lines of: “only when I’m in my 50’s or later”, I thought he was joking, I really believed he was pulling my leg, until he made it really clear that he was being deadly serious. I was a little upset, but I wanted to understand why. His reasoning for doing so was because: he didn’t want to conform to “societies norms”, he said too many people “play by the book” and he believes people should break that, that our love shouldn’t be defined by a legally binding contract and that after people marry it all goes down hill from there. I explained that I didn’t view marriage that way, that I viewed marriage as two people making eternal promises to one another and that making vows and sharing a day where we can celebrate our relationship is very important to me (and of course ever since I was a little girl I’ve always fantasised about the dress and the ring). He replied with “if it’s a day you want I’ll throw you a party, I’ll get you a ring so you can tell people we’re married, but I’m not getting married until late”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this conversation we have had the same discussion about 5 times over the last 6 months. I always end up burying my head in the sand and hoping that by the next time he has changed his opinion, even if it’s only a little. But nothing has changed and he is very set on his opinion. I’ve even spoken to my mother and stepfather about it, who themselves didn’t marry until they were both 55, and they say it’s “just an age thing, he’ll grow out of it in the next 5 years”. But I don’t know if I can see that happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he’s being so so stubborn about it being so late in life. He still says he wants to marry, just not until then. Other information I do feel is important to add is that his parents are divorced (so are mine), and divorced when he was 17, from what I know it was quite a turbulent split and his mother claims she left it later than she should’ve. Other than that our relationship is strong, arguments are rare and I’m very close with his family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do love him very dearly, and I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but this is something I’ve always wanted to fulfil in my life and something I believe is a very important aspect of a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of staying with him for the rest of my life and never getting married has crossed my mind, I don’t want to be bitter or resentful in 30 years time because he deprived me of being able to marry while I get to watch all of my friends and family get married. But the thought of leaving him to find someone who can give me these things and living without him is just as bitter. \n",

      "EDIT: wow… I don’t know how many people will see this update but I’m overwhelmed by how many people have commented. Pretty much all the same thing, some just a little more hurtful than the others, some really motivating. Overall after reading all the comments I feel small, like really small… and stupid. I don’t know how I’ll be able to reply without getting really upset so I guess this is my reply. I feel incredibly insecure and honestly too embarrassed to reply to a lot of the comments here. So to those who do just want the best outcome for me I really appreciate your heartfelt advice and time. Thanks to everyone for your input, I never expected to get so many comments. \n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \\[34M\\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \\[33F\\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \\[35M\\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \\[36M\\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \\[?!?!?!\\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a \"Pretty girl card\" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to \"dress sexy\" for May the 4th. \\[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\\]\n",

      "Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \\[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \\[35M\\] saying I have nothing to apologize for.

      "Body text: UPDATE: A conversation last night pretty much confirmed my suspicion that he's planning to force a move when his mom visits next month. He has asked me to empty our storage unit before she arrives \"to prove to her that we are okay\" which makes zero sense. Then he dropped \"if we didn't have all the extra stuff we could just pack up and go try living with her and see what it's like.\"\n",

      "It's my understanding that I can't get a court order to prevent him from taking the kids out of state and I'd only be able to file an emergency order to return them after they were taken if he attempted to establish residence with them elsewhere. It's either that or file for divorce and add a provision that he not be able to leave the state with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I texted MIL telling her clearly that we do NOT want to live with her and that I just want to be on the same page so she isn't prepping her house and getting her hopes up for no reason. She stopped talking to both my husband and I. She's been pretty communicative but no contact with either Of us all day which is weird since lately it's been daily. A lot of weird things are suddenly making sense, like her insisting she would take my kids when she visits so we can have a day alone, which would never happen because they don't even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am alerting the rest of their family in her area that she is doing this so if they do try to take the kids the rest of the family can be on the lookout for them and let me know where they are. I am close with his dad and stepmom who I haven't said anything to about this up to this point.\n",
      "\n",

      "MIL was no/minimal contact for years and very suddenly after loss of the last family she had is pressuring us to move in with her with our two kids 1800 miles away from everything they have ever known. My husband wants to go and I do not. It’s ruining our relationship. What rights do I have if I do not want to move my family across the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief history. MIL and I had a good relationship until we moved out of state after 6 years. She cut contact with my Husband for many months and it took years for them to establish a relationship again. During that time we got married, had a baby, and she still refused contact with me because I \"took her baby\" from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was 4 years ago. She lost her brother a few months ago and he was the last of her family. She doesn't have familial relationships with anyone except a very distant relationship with her brother's 2 kids. This is by her doing. She has largely cut her other son out of her life because she doesn't like his new girlfriend and feels she is taking him from her (sounds familiar). So suddenly she is reaching very intensely out of the blue to establish a relationship with me and my daughter who she has had no contact with her entire life. Never sent a gift or a card or called to talk to her (she's 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she is saying she wants us to come live with her. We are 1800 miles apart. She wants us to live with her until we find work and a home near her. To me, it feels like she's grasping at the last shred of family she has left realizing that she has no one else. She is enchanting my husband with how magical this will be. She will babysit, buy all our food, cook for us, give us date nights whenever we want, we can live in her 10 acres and have lots of space for our two kids and our dogs. It all sounds great except.. we live here. Our jobs are here. Our life and all our kids have ever known is here. There is no reason to leave other than her suddenly deciding this is what needs to happen. She literally went from not talking to me for 4 years to texting me \"I love you\" every day and telling me how she's getting her house ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing a HUGE problem between my husband and I because he LOVES this idea but before this we were happy living where we are. We have goals and plans that are based here. One of our kids is in school here, I'm in college here, we have a good program here that allows anyone to get a free degree up to a bachelors. I can finish school without owing any money. There are many reasons I want to stay where we are. The same reasons we chose to live here in the first place. But now my husband is caving under this delusion of a beautiful carefree life with his mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to resolve this. I'm not moving my family across the country on a whim just because my MIL decided she's lonely and he's set that it would be great for our family. She is set to visit for the first time next month after saying for YEARS she would NEVER come here and previously said she would come up to help us move everything in with her. I kind of feel like they are planning to twist my arm when she is here and try to force moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I protect myself from this and also keep a good relationship with my husband? I don't even know what my legal rights are if he were to say we're moving and I don't want to.\n",

      "[My (46F) BF’s (49M) friend (47F) doesn’t want me around : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kkvbca/my_46f_bfs_49m_friend_47f_doesnt_want_me_around/)\n",
      "\n",
      "TL; DR - My (46F) BF (49M) has a decades-long friendship with a woman friend (47F) who has been unpleasant towards me and who isn't interested in getting to know me. They went out to dinner alone, and I didn't like what he reported back about how it went. We discussed how to handle it; I wasn't comfortable with the resolution until yesterday when we clarified some things. It turns out he had already taken many steps to distance himself from her and is fully committed to making sure all of his friends treat me respectfully.\n",

      "\\_\\_\\_\\_\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I had a long chat with BF yesterday. I am feeling fine now. I had made some incorrect assumptions and misunderstood a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1 - He had already resolved to refuse any one-on-one invites from her. At the end of our last discussion, he'd said he wasn't sure what he would say to her. I thought that meant he wasn't sure if he would turn her down or not. He actually just meant he wasn't sure how he would phrase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 - I assumed they were in closer touch over text than is true. After the dinner last year, I told him that I'd prefer him not to go out with her alone but that I didn't expect him to completely end the friendship and that remaining in contact was fine as long as it was appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he had not initiated a single text to her since their dinner last year after I expressed concern. She has texted him maybe 5 times in the past year, all very benign and appropriate, like \"Happy birthday\" or \"I heard your uncle passed away; condolences.\" He responded to each with polite but very short messages \"Thank you. Hope you're well.\" No phone calls or other forms of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that they'd been slightly drifting apart before we met anyway, so he decided to steer things in the direction of drifting even further out of contact since it was creating an issue for us. He was prepared to be more confrontational if she got inappropriate again but was happy to find that it wasn't necessary. As mentioned in the original post, they have many many overlapping friend and family links so it would be preferable not to have a dramatic rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - I assumed they were bumping into each other at group events with some frequency. It turns out she hasn't been able to attend any of the same events that he has. The last time they actually saw each other was in fact that dinner last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that I was avoiding asking for details about how often they were in contact as a way to cope with my discomfort without being too controlling. I can be a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\" so I was doing well in not letting it bother me until I saw her name pop up in a recent text, right after one of those events that I'd assumed he'd seen her at. We decided that going forward, he will proactively tell me anytime he has even incidental contact with her so that I can assume nothing is happening if I don't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a long discussion about respect in general. He is totally willing to drop any friends who are disrespectful to me or our relationship. We also discussed what appropriate behaviors look like; I think he has a much better awareness now. I asked him to think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was out alone with a male friend, and he was a fly on the wall, would be happy to hear us discussing sex or hear the other guy make even borderline disparaging remarks about him? He admitted that he would not, and he will adhere to the same standard going forward with any female friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he said he's willing to refuse any other one-on-one invitations from women who don't want to include me and to drop the friendship if they are pushy about it. Luckily this isn't likely to be a big issue, as I have met and really like most of his female friends, and the ones who live far away and haven't visited yet have already said that they're eager to meet me as soon as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I currently feel a little silly for having worked myself up so much over a woman that he's seen once and exchanged about 20 words of text with in the past 18 months. But relieved that it's resolved. And I learned that the \"out of site out of mind\" tactic is not a good long-term fix for me; if something is bugging me, I need to go ahead and ask about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have approached him about it before as I have childhood trauma from alcohol abuse and it’s also just something that is not attractive. We have that conversation twice. He got sober for about 2 weeks and then went back into drinking. I justified it as it’s not hard alcohol, but I told him he can’t just have one drink. He realized it and did better, but it just never stuck. Now, it’s the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned this and I haven’t been able to separate from him since he wasn’t in the states cause he went on a family vacation. \n",

      "Fast forward- I met his family and his parents thanked me that I helped him cool down on the alcohol. How are they see the love he has and the work he is putting in.

So that next day, he was SEVERELY hungover to where he was shaking, cold shivers, feeling nauseous, etc. at that point, I didn’t feel an ounce of emotion as I was already fed up. Decided I’ll talk to him once we get back to the states. Mind you, not admitting he drank heavily by himself all day. \n",

      "I’m just here to vent. To remind myself that I’m doing the right thing. To express I have so much love for him, he does anything and everything for me without a second guess.. I’m just hurt trying to compartmentalize it all. I feel like the bad guy for doing this for myself. I want him to better himself but this was an issue I’ve dealt with him 2 months in.

      "\n",
      "My (29F) boyfriend (28M) often makes snide remarks about how my family supports me financially, and calls me privileged for it. We've been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an only child, my family isn't rich but we share what we have with each other. Before my current boyfriend, I was with an ex that painted himself as a good guy up until I moved across the country with him and he isolated me, abused me, stole all my money, and knocked me up. I have a 2 year old daughter with him, but I was able to escape the situation when I was 5 months pregnant. My parents bought my plane ticket home and welcomed me with open arms. They assumed full financial responsibility for my child and I so that I could be a stay at home mom on top of healing from the trauma and going back to college to finish up my degrees and work when I'm ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend comes from an affluent family; however, his father passed away 2 years ago, and he was the sole breadwinner for the family. It turned his family's life upside down, his mother is now living off of money lent from other family members and social security as she's in her 70s and can't work. He works under the table at a place that doesn't pay hourly, it's based on commissions. He's there for 10+ hours some days but if there's no customers, he doesn't get paid a penny. On a good day, he'll make about $70, but that's so disproportionate to what he should be making for that amount of time worked (we're in CA). He's really angry about not having much money, but also refuses to look for another job out of loyalty to his boss who's also his friend. He's always upset about being late on payments as well as his mom asking him for money. I feel bad for him and I try to be as understanding as I can, I know he's under a lot of stress financially, and I never ask him for anything or expect anything from him. Just his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he's been making more and more jabs at me about being \"Miss Privileged\" for taking handouts from my parents and not having to work while he works 5 days a week and is still struggling to make ends meet. All my parents help me with is my $25 a month phone bill and food and clothes from the thrift store for my daughter. I left everything I had when I left my ex and came home to my parents and live minimalistically, but my boyfriend had many payments he's responsible for (car, phone, credit card, student loans, helping his mom, etc). I'm trying to be empathetic towards him and I know he has it much harder than me, but there's nothing I can do about it and I don't think I should be ashamed for having a family that takes care of me when I'm down.\n",

      "TLDR; My boyfriend is a great partner in practical ways (helpful, supportive, kind in actions) but struggles with emotional reassurance. He rarely gives verbal/physical affection, shuts down when I’m upset, and gets frustrated when I ask if he’s mad (he has a neutral face that looks angry). I have anxious tendencies and crave more emotional connection, which he feels is too much. He thinks my anxiety is the main problem, but I’m wondering if we’re just emotionally incompatible. Sometimes I feel like he hates me but I think that's all in my head. I'm not sure what to do\n",

      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, living together for 3 months. He’s genuinely a good partner in many ways. He helps around the house, supports us financially, remembers little details about me, and is always down to do activities I suggest. He’s not controlling, doesn’t mind when I go out with friends/family, and shows his care through actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But emotionally, I struggle. He doesn’t express affection verbally much (rarely says “I love you” or compliments), and when I’m upset or crying, he tends to shut down. He says he doesn’t want to say “I love you” too often ot compliments me because it loses its value. Or feels like I'll just keep asking for more if he gives me what I need. So he'd rather leave it as is so I don't end up asking him to say those words more frequently.\n",

      "He’s not big on physical comfort either, especially when he’s annoyed. When I ask him for reassurance like a hug or kind words, he usually doesn’t respond or changes the subject.\n",

      "He also has a very neutral resting face that looks pissed off to me, which triggers my anxiety. I tend to ask, “Are you mad?” or “Is something wrong?” often. He says he’s fine, but then gets frustrated that I keep asking. He feels like I’m accusing him of being mad when he’s not, and it leads to tension. This has happened enough times that he feels we’re having the same tiring conversation over and over. Sometimes I feel like he hates me with the way he reacts or talks to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, he even chose to sleep on the couch, saying maybe if he acts like he doesn’t care, I’ll realize what “not caring” actually looks like, because he feels my constant questioning implies he doesn’t care.\n",

      "He thinks my anxiety is the root cause of our issues and has suggested medication. I’m open to working on myself and I’ve told him I’m willing to go to therapy. But I also wonder if we’re just emotionally mismatched in terms of needs and expression.\n",

After two years he dropped out. He worked a p/t job in retail for just under half a year and then went back to construction for a year and a half. While working construction again he was reminded of how taxing it is on his body and how he can't stay in that field. He recently went for surgery and is still healing.

They were both said in a joking tone, not mean. He has said something like that to me one other time a few months ago and i immediately told him to never speak to me like that. He apologized and hasn’t since then. I think it was him being drunk and with his friends and wanting to impress them or whatever.

      "For context we had a rough patch at the start of our marriage because I was so insecure about his exes because he told me about them too much when we were dating, he told me they broke up because it was a mutual understanding because they did not love each other anymore, so I was paranoid because we had dated only a short while after they broke up and got married 6 months after fast-forward to now he confessed that he had lied to me about the reason why, it turns out he cheated on both his exes and his recent one with the one prior and then cheated on the recent one with someone he met on a business trip. I asked him why he didn't tell me he said it was because he knew I loathed cheaters and I wouldn't marry him if I knew he was one (My dad cheated on my mom, which my mom still doesn't know about and I don't have the heart to tell her). \n",

I don't really know whether to believe that that was it, but now I'm stuck because he took off to his friends house because he said he couldn't face me. I don't know what to do moving forward, I want to try to mend things but I don't know how we can manage if he keeps running away from me and I just end up feeling like I'm chasing after a dead end. I guess I'm insecure of being divorced because it's frowned upon where I grew up. Sorry this is long I guess I just need to vent because he won't come home and doesn't want to talk to me.

      "Title: I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context:\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n",
      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",
      "* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n",
      "* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n",
      "* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n",

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

      "Title: I (32M) need to figure out what to do about my almost sexless 6 years relationship with my girlfriend (26F).\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR: Basically, I have a relationship with a girl that I like a lot; we have a very satisfying romantic life, but sex is almost always a problem. I have to initiate every time, and even when it gets going (once per month or less) the experience we have is kinda passionless and very clunky, for lack of a better word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry in advance if there’s some kink with my English, it‘s not my native language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the deal, and it’s a thing that’s been driving me insane for years: I love my girlfriend with all my heart, and she loves me back the same way, but she’s not interested in having an active sexual life with me, and for sure she’s not capable or not willing to initiate any sexual intercourse with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not that we haven’t discussed the problem through the years: the conversation always started from me, and she’s always reluctant to talk about it (she’s not much for difficult psychological and emotional matters and she’s kinds shy). And through the years she gave many different reasons for her apparent disinterest in sex (or in sex with me). Most importantly, that she never was that interested in the thing in the first place (even though in the beginning she was the one pestering me because we weren’t having enough moments of physical intimacy), but also she talked about me not being 100% her type, e.g. she would like for me to have a more athletic, even muscular body, while I’m more of a chubby guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem is (and trust me, I’m not really bragging or anything here, I’m just trying to be as honest as possible) that I’m not at all an ugly dude: I’m very confident, I know how to fascinate a girl and I’ve had many occasions to be flirtatious with others -even unfaithful- but I’ve never been able to act upon them, because I’m just not that kind of person. God knows how hard it has been, with sexual satisfaction coming my way once a month or even less, and always under my solicitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not to say that our feelings for each other aren’t the real deal and that’s what makes me feel so bad about this. When everything clicks in it’s place the times we spend together are amazing. Also, she’s always managed to push me out of my comfort zone and to bring out the best part of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s just that… having basically no sexual life sometimes really hurts. I’m not at all an hyper-sexual guy, and in my mind it feels at times kinda base and petty to make such a big deal about sex, when everything else works well. But you know, what makes this even more aggravating is the fact that having to always initiate any moment of intimacy, and then seeing her mostly interested in having her needs satisfied, while being kinda not interested, or awkward and detached when it comes to my part of the deal… makes for a very miserable experience.\n",

      "As I grew older, I realized that this kind of behavior isn’t normal. I’ve tried talking to her about it, asking her to communicate with me if I ever upset her.

      "Body text: Thank you for reading if you’re here 🥲\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background: I’m 26F, living with my fiancé (28M) about an hour north of my mom. We recently bought a 3-bedroom house we’ve been remodeling ourselves. It’s still a work in progress—one room doesn’t even have drywall or flooring yet and is currently being used to store our tools and paint. Our bedroom is finished, but the guest room doesn’t even have a door yet (we still need to buy them) and is also doubling as a storage space. We live with our three cats. My little sister is 14F, and is about to graduate from 8th grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto my mom. She’s a pathological liar. It’s something I’ve tolerated for years because most of her lies are small and don’t cause major harm. But it still bothers everyone who knows her—she lies constantly, doubles down when questioned, and ends conversations instead of owning up to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, her lying became a serious issue. She was kicked out of the house where my sisters and I grew up, but she told everyone she had sold it voluntarily. She assured us she had somewhere to go. She didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I called her to check in during her “move,” she was panicked and said she needed help moving a U-Haul and her car. I rushed over after work and found the house in a terrible state—completely unprepared, dirty, and filled with trash bags. There was grime all over the floor, a fridge that looked like it hadn’t worked in years, and everything that couldn’t be moved alone was simply left behind: her bedroom set, my childhood room, my sister’s belongings—years of memories just abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She admitted she had nowhere to go. I did the only thing I could think of: I got her into one of the apartments owned by the company I worked for. I signed the lease myself, put it under my name, and paid the full deposit and rent out of pocket, knowing I wouldn’t see that money again. I even risked my job to get her off the street. She had just $40K coming in from the sale of the house but wouldn’t receive it for a few more days. She was in her car with my 12-year-old sister and their two dogs (a 5 lb chihuahua and a 200 lb mastiff), with nowhere to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister didn’t even know they were moving. When I picked her up, she was confused and asked if they were just going to check out a new place. My mom lied directly to her face and said they had just bought a new house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, my mom repaid me for the apartment, but she then moved into a rental house for $2,600/month—completely unaffordable. I begged her not to. I hated watching her spend what little money she had furnishing the entire place from scratch, but she ignored me. She bought everything new—beds, couches, TVs, pillows, blankets—all to replace the things she left behind. I hoped she could stabilize in 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to yesterday: I get a call from my mom. She has to be out of her rental by midnight. She claims she’s been paying rent but her landlord wasn’t paying the mortgage and the house is being reclaimed. She’s scrambling to move everything into a U-Haul. Once again, my sister knows nothing. My mom told my sister (WHILE SHE WAS MOVING HER SHIT INTO A UHAUL) that she would  leave the apartment unlocked so my sister and I could grab clothes for her dad’s house over the weekend. I ended up having to be the one to break the news: “Mom got kicked out. Everything is in a storage unit now.” My sister was devastated, unsure why my mom couldn’t be honest with her. My sister asked me if my mom had bothered to pack her bed. It makes me cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have the resources to help this time. I can’t house her, especially with the mastiff. We’re financially stretched thin from the remodel. My fiancé and I both work full-time and aren’t home during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister is heartbroken. She’s supposed to go on a weeklong school trip to DC on Tuesday. My mom promised to drive her and her friend to the school that day. Now we’re not even sure if her things were packed or left behind again. Had we known what was happening, we could’ve at least made sure she brought her essentials to her dad’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just at a complete loss. My mom lies so much I never know what’s real. I know the obvious answer is “don’t believe anything,” but how am I supposed to help someone like that? I have nothing left to give, but I hate watching my sister go through this. I’m heartbroken and disappointed beyond words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to be honest, refuses to take accountability, and seems to believe that if she ignores her problems long enough, a miracle will fix them. But no miracle comes. And now my little sister, once again, is the one suffering the consequences.\n",

      "Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 and a 1/3rd ish years. We are both in our 3rd year of college(dual enrollment in high school)and still living at home/not on our own. Recently, our topic of conversation has been constantly swayed to the fact that I told her I wanted to wait until we are a. Financially secure b. Out of college/living together and c. Fix some of our relationship issues before getting engaged/ married. She however, has said that she wanted to be engaged within the next few months. Things took a turn for the worse today, and she is now saying that my views don’t align with hers and that she doesn’t think she wants to continue a relationship with me. She is saying that I am unwilling to choose her and that our love is conditional. She is also saying that she doesn’t want to wait and that she doesn’t want to be together because I want to wait and that it’s not fair for her to have to wait because I want to wait. For a little context I did mention a little bit about possible engagement sites/ rings but I didn’t say definitively that it would happen. How do I approach/ have a conversation with her about this without it resulting in her turning me down or not hearing my side? (I apologize if I may have left any details out, this currently has me very anxious becuase I do love her and want a future with her, I just need more time to feel ready for this big of a commitment)\n",

There hasn’t been one person I’ve introduced him too that doesn’t love him (close friends, family, etc.) and I trust the people closest to me of their opinion but i got this text in the middle of the night which I’m positive is from a fake number “stay woke girl. He puts up a good act. I would go through his phone if I were you” and another one that said “don’t say no one warned you”.  I asked him about it and he was clear that it was nothing and to go through his phone if I needed/wanted too. It’s been dwelling on me trying to figure out who would text me this and why and how do they have my number. Whoever sent me these messages didn’t reply with any sort of answer on why I should be worried and just told me to be careful. \n",

      "A few nights ago, we went on a date and had a great time. The next day, I got a text from her asking who a particular girl was. She only gave me a first name, so I asked for the last name. When she replied, I explained it was someone I went to school with. I didn’t think much of it and just left it at that.\n",

      "This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Twice before, my girlfriend has confronted me about women I follow on Instagram. Before we got serious, I made it a point to clear out my following list—removing anyone I had dated, met through dating apps, or had any romantic history with. I only kept people I knew from high school, family friends, and similar connections. \n",

      "The first time, she went through the accounts of the women I followed, asking who they were, why I followed them, and whether I had liked their photos. The second time, she randomly brought up another girl I followed and asked me to unfollow her. I figured it wasn’t a big deal, so I did.\n",

      "Body text: I wouldn't know for sure if I should label my girlfriend (22F) as \"emotionally dependent,\" but I don’t have a better term, so I apologize. She’s a very jealous person, and her constant phrases like “I couldn’t live without you” have me genuinely worried. She’s gone through very difficult situations in her life, and I partly understand why she is the way she is. She has practically no close friends or anyone to lean on, and despite all my efforts to encourage her to see life and relationships differently, she stays stuck in the idea that she’ll never need anyone but me—and that I will never leave her.\n",

      "\n",
      "And the worst part is that I constantly feel guilty, because I know I reinforced many of her patterns of thinking and behavior. At the beginning of our relationship, I was the one who told her I could change for her, that I’d do anything for her, and that she’d never lack love from me. In reality, all of that was a lie—not out of cruelty, but because I didn’t know how to measure my words when I was with her. And now, I don’t act the same way I did in the first two months of our relationship.\n",

We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "I (27f) recently ended a long-term relationship to a (30m) shortly after we got engaged. We were together for about 4 years, and we were long distance because of his schooling and me being from a different country. When we were in the same place, things were usually really good. We had a lot in common, a strong friendship, and for a long time, I truly believed we were building a future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things started to shift once we got engaged. We began arguing constantly. I felt like I was being tested all the time, like I had to prove how committed or independent I was. He doubted me over little things, including the fact that I didn’t stay an extra day after the engagement, even though I had valid financial and logistical reasons. He would bring up how many times he had come to visit me, but completely overlooked how often I traveled to him, how much effort I put in, and how much I contributed emotionally and financially to the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family dynamic added another layer of stress. I often felt judged or dismissed, and he didn’t really stand up for me. I was called high maintenance for doing basic things like getting my hair done, even though I was the one paying for all of our time together. He did not plan dates, pay for anything, etc. I was preparing to move, give up my job, leave my home, and let go of everything familiar so I could be with him.

      "Body text: My boyfriend(22M) and I(21F) have been dating for nine months. He often drinks alcohol gets too drunk and then takes it out on me non physically. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days ago, I hit my head on the pavement after taking a fall. This is right in the middle of finals, whereas I am supposed to be graduating this semester. I finally decide to go to the doctor today because I have a headache and my vision is a little blurry. I go to the school doctor, which then tells me to go to the ER because symptoms are worrisome. The school doctor doesn’t let me leave the building without somebody coming to get me. Obviously, I call my boyfriend who lives with me, to come and get me. The only problem with that is that he was blacked out drunk so I had to call my other friend. This friend gets my boyfriend in his car and takes us to the hospital. All three of us are waiting in the waiting room and my boyfriend leaves. Apparently he went in the parking lot and threw up a bunch. I’m waiting to get a CT scan and cannot deal with him. After I get my CT scan done and everything he gets back inside my other friend at this point has to leave, leaving me alone with my boyfriend. While we’re waiting, he starts getting aggressive calling me a beach, saying that this is a waste of his time, and generally just being rude to me. At this point I’m frustrated because he’s asking me the same questions over and over and my headache is not going away. I tell him to leave if he’s going to do that, but he says “no frick you I’m not gonna do that.” We finally get discharged, and on the way back he’s asking me the same questions again. When we get out of the Uber, I walk across the street to our apartment, and he just stays there. He leaves to go drink with his fraternity friends. And now I’m here alone at home with a huge headache and a concussion. \n",
      "The thing about this is that things like this I have happened before. I hit my head because I was trying to pick him off of the floor after he was blacked out and he left the apartment. He’s called me weak when I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression because he doesn’t believe in it. I’m just starting to hate him. I don’t want to. But it’s hard when somebody treats you like this, especially if you love them, and especially when they say they love you. \n",
      "I’m just tired and my head hurts. I don’t know what to do. He’s just hurt me so much and it’s obvious he doesn’t care about me. I guess I can’t beg him to love me, but I do still love him. When he’s sober, he treats me like a queen but when he’s drunk, his behavior is inexcusable. \n",

      "Title: At the end of my tether with alcoholic, severely depressed boyfriend\n",
      "Body text: My (27f) boyfriend (33m) of 6 years has within the last year developed very serious depression and more recently has started very heavy drinking habits. This culminated a few months ago with an involuntary stay in a psychiatric facility after a frightening withdrawal episode. After that, we moved states to a less stressful job for him and I thought everything would be okay from then on. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the depression and drinking has started up with a vengeance and he is drinking more than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "He will not move except to pace around nervously and go to buy more alcohol. He refuses to come into the living room or leave the house unless he is going to the liquor store. And believe me, he has plenty of reasons to be depressed- he never fully grieved the loss of his brother a few years ago and has undiagnosed PTSD from a deployment. He also has sustained multiple head injuries, which he doesn't care to go to the doctor for. The issue is that he absolutely refuses to seek out any treatment; rehab, counseling, therapy, psychiatry, nothing. Even my suggestions of having me drive him to appointments is like me talking to a brick wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship that he has been neglecting and I've been desperately trying to shield her from the reality, but the few times he manages to come to the dinner table he is visibly drunk and will start being a dickhead to both of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reading I've done on this subject suggests that unless the affected person is willing to take their treatment into their own hands, the relationship is almost certainly doomed. He doesn't even seem to fully understand that I won't put up with this for much longer. Every thing I say to him goes in one ear out the other. And then when I try to leave the room to work or to grieve quietly by myself, he follows me because he refuses to be alone while also not wanting help. He blames me for his drinking and depression (I have had issues myself, but I was always functional and was never that severe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Is my instinct right that this relationship is doomed? This is my worst nightmare come true, I have been with him for so long and he used to be so wonderful. But now I can't see a future in this relationship if he legitimately has no interest in bettering myself.\n",

      "Body text: I've (28 F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (29M) for a year. Our honeymoon phase ended about 6 months ago and we've been learning how to speak through differences that we have. It's been really challenging and my biggest concerns have been the topics of cats, dancing, and children. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love cats. I understand them and I find their company comforting. My boyfriend is highly allergic to them. When he first used to come over, my cat would be doing his thing: cuddling in bed at night and such. That made my boyfriend break out on a rash that was so itchy that he scratched until he bled. Now my cat isn't allowed on the bed, or even in the bedroom when he comes over. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love dancing. Specifically, I enjoy partner dancing and I'm really good at it. It makes me feel alive! My boyfriend says that he feels angry and jealous at the idea of me dancing with anybody else other than him. But we've not danced with each other and he would only want to take private lessons (which I cannot afford right now). Since he can afford lessons, he did propose that we do 2 private lessons a month. However, this has not come to fruition for two reasons: both of our cars have needed major repairs, and I also think that dancing is an extremely low priority for him. It's been 3 months since the lessons were brought up the first time. I am now forcing myself to go out dancing alone this month regardless of how he feels because I felt depressed not dancing. My boyfriend has said that he will not impose his feelings of anger and jealously on me and I must do what is right for me, but he will not work on those feelings. So far, he has not reacted in a negative way but I know he is uncomfortable. \n",
      "\n",
      "His stance on having children has changed. I am passionate about having a child in my future. I want to be a parent. When we started dating, he wanted children too. Now he says he will take responsibility for a child of he has too, but he is unsure because the right things need to be in place: financial stability; a stable home; and emotional stability. He's elaborated that he worries that I'm not emotionally stable (I have been actively working through my own childhood trauma and seen results). I believe working through trauma is a lifelong process, but that I'll make the strides necessary to heal before I have a child. However, this change in his stance has me concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that everybody's boundaries regarding what they tolerate in their life versus where they draw the line and move on from a relationship is different. How can I address this? I keep wondering if I should break up with him. But we both are putting in a kind and concerted effort into the relationship and we have huge respect for each other, so I'm caught between wanting to have my cat near me, and having to imagine a life without him ever being in my bed again. Always having to tread gently around my passion for dancing around him. And wondering if he's going to embrace fatherhood, or just accept responsibility for it and not jump into it with me. Is it worthwhile to pursue a relationship with this man, who is worthwhile, at the risk of parts of myself not being able to express themselves fully and comfortably? \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I've been dating my boyfriend for a year, and while we respect and care deeply for each other, key differences are creating tension. He's highly allergic to my cat, which now isn't allowed in my bedroom. He feels angry and jealous about me dancing with others but isn't prioritizing dancing with me, which has affected my mental health. Most significantly, his views on having children have shifted from wanting them to being unsure and questioning my emotional readiness due to my trauma work. I'm feeling anxious and torn between honoring my passions and future goals or staying in a relationship where I'm unsure if my core desires will be met.\n",

      "Body text: Hey everyone, I (27M) have been feeling burnt out from my wife (26F). My wife and I recently gotten married around 10 months ago, but together for 9years. We always had what I considered a great relationship. We found joy in small things, she did her best to understand my upbringing and culture. But before the wedding my wife has been anxious about fitting in the dress and starting losing some weight. I wasn’t a fan then but when we use to speak about she said everything’s going to go back to normal after the wedding. From our honeymoon to present she has continued to lose weight, and from 7 months ago has been diagnosed with anorexia. \n",
      "\n",
      "From before the diagnosis we would get into small fights about lack of sex, her feeling like I’m not attracted to her “new body”. I learned that comes with her diagnosis. I did everything that I can to be supportive. I’ve taken control of making meals for her, then convincing her to eat those meals with me, then have a conversation for the next 2hours regarding what she ate and how it made her feel. She recently left her job due to anxiety as well and I’ve done my best to adjust financially as well. Her doctor suggested therapy and I listened to the rules I was told, no showing her old photos, not pushing her to eat….then she lost more weight and now may have to stay at a hospital. We have been talking a lot more about treatments but that always ends in an argument. Almost like convincing an alcoholic that they have a problem. \n",

      "I guess my question is lately I feel myself becoming more and more short with her, I’m not excited to come home, meals feel like a war zone , almost every conversation we have is regarding food.

      "Also I guess some added things, she has been home for a couple of months. She’s been lying to me about eating and doctors visits. I may find out soon if she can stay at the hospital but she really doesn’t want too. We don’t have sex anymore we have tried but I couldn’t “react”. I know this is the illness talking but it just feels like she isn’t worried about this as much as me. Thanks again\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been dating an amazing girl for 7 months now. Her personality is the best I could ask for understanding, considerate, kind, unmaterialistic. She does have mental problems like insecurities, scared to call people but I couldn’t care less about them. And I did love her in the beginning. However recently I started doubting my own feelings. One moment I look at her and see the cutest being ever and then the other I just feel empty. I do have my own issues associated with childhood like abandonment threats when I was a kid and other abusive things revolving round my childhood. I was also raised to be as efficient as I could be and well we know relationships are not efficient at all.And so recently I was wondering what to do because I just can’t understand my own feelings. I either feel like I love her or simply nothing towards her. But when I imagine her cry I wanna cry and throw up. When I imagine breaking up with her I just can’t help but hesitate that im breaking smth that I shouldn’t. I just feel so conflicted and broken right now.

      "Body text: I’m a 21 yo male, I’ve had a 3 year+ relationship ship with my gf, 21 yo female. Lately I’ve been so selfish and focused on fixing myself and changing things that don’t need changed. We openly discussed this. I’m aware of the problem I’ve caused and I want to fix it. During this period of selfishness I’ve stopped showing my love to her. I stopped kissing, never say I love you until it’s said to me first, never come up with date ideas, I just wasn’t there. But I love this woman so much, she has saved my life and loves me unconditionally. I can never see that look of sadness again when I said that I haven’t been loving her. She said she won’t leave though, because she has to enough love for the both of us. So fuck me and my endeavors, I need to live for this woman again. I need to uncover my love that I buried underneath everything. I know it’s still there, how do I dig it out? How do I re-wire my brain? She said I used to be perfect until I tried to fix things that weren’t there. I need to get back to the real loving me. Does anyone have any kind of advice?\n",

      "Im a F (27) my bf of 5 almost 6 years is 34. He’s an amazing man and step dad he literally takes care of everything but he is not affectionate in general. He tells me he loves me as well as my son who he has been in his life since my son was 2 and basically helped me raise him.\n",

      "He never snuggles and never gives me random kisses etc unless he’s drunk. We smoke flower together and his personality doesn’t change but when he drinks he opens up like a Book. He tells me all about his life and gives me so much affection it feels like I’m in a movie.\n",
      "\n",

      "The reason I’m posting is because this happened again right now and all I can think of is I feel like getting him something to drink so that he can be nice to me again. But I feel like that’s not right. I know I should probably compromise and accept that he isn’t generally an affectionate person but it drives me crazy knowing he has the capability to do the things that would make me so happy and he just doesn’t unless he’s had a couple drinks.\n",

Im not saying it just cause, her uni is here (she takes online classes), there are way more opportunities in general (she doesnt even have food delivery to say one). Turns out she doesnt wanna move, she has a full time job rn and doesnt want to leave it and her family. We basically have no future I guess... but we love each other so much, what should I do?

I’ve tried going on dates but no luck. Lately we’ve been talking more frequently. She’s starting to watch the shows I watch, and me watch hers.

      "\n",
      "I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for around 2 years now. Just after the 1 year mark (mid year 2024) we moved in together. It was hard to adjust to but we really wanted this so we tried really hard to make it work. It was really hard and some weeks we fought every day and nearly called it quits multiple times. I felt very sad and very lonely. At the worst of it he decided we needed to break up (end of 2024) we decided we wouldn’t end the lease and just stay until it was finished. we had different rooms and our scheduled didn’t align so we didn’t really see each other that much. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time I was obviously devastated and depressed and extremely lonely. He treated me like he didn’t know me and like I was trash when we were out in public or with friends but at home he would try to be nice and friendly with me. It really messed with my head ALOT. I was so up and down not knowing what was going on. He started going out a lot and I felt even more lonely because he didn’t invite me to anything or want me around his friends really, I also tried to make plans with him but he was always “busy”. It was heartbreaking to feel rejected like that. Eventually I started going out with my friends more and having fun and I felt so alive again. Obviously I yearned for that comfortability and safeness that he gave me but I was having fun. I started talking to someone I used to talk to again and a guy I had randomly met had started talking to me. It was all going fine until one nice he came across the messages and was really really upset. In my head I believed he shouldn’t have been upset because he broke up with me but he felt as though it was wrong and I was leading him on? We had a big fight and I messaged those two guys saying sorry I can’t do this I’m just not in the right headspace at the moment which they both understood and respected. I tried really hard to win my ex boyfriend back over so he didn’t hate me. After a while of just putting my feelings last and just prioritising stability between us he finally stopped hating me. He felt that we were better and asked me if we could give things another go which I agreed to because I felt that we were better and I felt loved and appreciated. I felt that we could make things work and I felt safe and comfortable with him.

But I’m also worried that the grass isn’t green on the other side and that I’m going to loose such a lovely person in my life who I love dearly. My family also loves him and he is so lovely to my friends and is just a great guy. Because I know if we end he probably wouldn’t want to be friends with me again. \n",

      "Body text: So, I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 2.5 years, but we’ve been friends for much longer. In September, we moved out of my parents' house to a new city far away from out hometown, and I really like it here. She’s a very emotional person, and I feel like I can tell her everything, knowing she’ll always be there for me. I love her very much and care about her wellbeing. I also enjoy cooking, which is why I usually take care of the cooking in our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a rule that whoever is cooking doesn’t have to clean up afterward. This is mostly due to our tempers — we tend to fight over small things. Today we had another fight because I put away the ingredients after making dinner, but didn’t clean the countertops. I told her she should clean it, since I spent about 45 minutes cooking while she was playing Sims 4. She got upset and reminded me that she won’t clean up after me because I didn’t clean the kitchen after breakfast. Usually I make breakfast for the two of us or we eat alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told me she’s exhausted from living with me. The thing is, I feel like I do around 60% of the chores in our house. I have ADHD, so sometimes I forget to put a plate away or close a cabinet. I understand that it can be a burden for her when I leave these things for a few hours, but I’m the one cleaning the whole apartment every Saturday, while she only cleans the bathroom. I’m okay with that because, until recently, she worked on Saturdays.\n",

      "I have very little free time because I’m studying Electrical Engineering at one of the top 3 universities in my country, and I have to study A LOT. I also work part-time. When I do have free time, I try to focus on my hobbies, which are making music and skateboarding. I love my life and try to stay optimistic, even though it’s not always easy. I’m not passionate about my degree, but I want to secure a good job in the future, especially since my girlfriend is studying Vocal Jazz at a music university. Even though it’s very hard to get into, it probably won’t bring her much financial security. She’s not sure about this career path and often tells me she doesn’t belong there (although she’s very talented and trained a lot when she was younger). I remind her that she won’t get another chance to get a prestigious degree title with that little effort. Don’t get me wrong — she prepares for her classes, but it doesn’t take her much time. Also professor there are very little concerned about skipping classes, when at my Uni I can’t skip even one hour.\n",

      "She comes from a poor family, and I don’t want her to worry about money. I’m not rich either, but we’re doing okay. That’s why I pay for food and heating, and I sometimes buy her nice things. On the other side last month she didn’t even get me a birthday present because she didn’t have money, which I’m fine with. She ordered sushi so it’s not like she forgot, but a present don’t have to be expensive. Also it kinda itch me, cause a week earlier, she bought a fairly expensive gift for her friend.\n",

When I tell her I’m exhausted from everything or that I’d love to have sex more often (now, we do it like 2 times a month), because it makes me feel emotionally close to her, I don’t feel like she offers much empathy. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t love me anymore. I don’t want to sound like a jerk but I feel like I’m quite good looking and take care of myself and I could do better.  \n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone. I need some honest advice because I’m going through an extremely confusing and emotionally difficult time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for a few months. Our relationship started not long after she broke up with her ex, whom she was with for 3 years. At first, things seemed great — we connected deeply and fast. She had and still has some problems With \"lndependence\" In the relatlionship. We also had some discutions about traumas from her past and I've been trying my best to comfort her and be there for her. l did an unintentional mistake regarding consent 2 weeks ago (nothing fully sexual) and this triggered a heavy emotional response in her. This is why this whole thing happening at the moment. Until now i think she repressed her feelings regarding the ex since things were going wonderful between the two of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she opened up to me and told me the full truth:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She still has feelings for her ex, but she doesn’t want to go back to him. (not actual love\" but attachent because of things he helped her with)\n",
      "* She says it’s incredibly hard to detach emotionally, because he was someone who helped her build self-confidence and supported her deeply through a lot.\n",
      "* He still messages her and tells her he loves her — and even though she *wants* to stop talking to him, she feels unable to stop replying and so does he even if he knows that this is toxic for both of them. He sugested that she should try to stop texting since he is unable to.\n",
      "* At the same time, she says she has feelings for *me* but she i is still fighting with the trust that she lost in me after the incident that I mentioned earlier. \n",
      "\n",
      "She is seeing a psychiatrist for quite some time and is now looking for a psychologist as well, because she feels she can’t carry this emotional burden alone anymore.\n",

      "Meanwhile, I feel caught in a limbo. I am waiting to see if she can forgive my mistake. We go through beautiful, intimate moments in these months. We found how similar We are and We are both in awe regarding what a match we are for each other on multiple plans (love, money, hobbies/activities, family, etc.). She also presented me to her parents recently and i also presented her to mine. They said that for the first time in forever she truly seems happy. Now she emotionally pulls away, and I feel her slipping. I'm doing my best to be there for her, to not pressure her, to give her space when she needs it just as she asked of me. I've stopped initiating most of our conversations, and lately she's been the one to reach out .\n",

      "She told me recently that she feels like she’s about to emotionally explode and that she can’t take the pain anymore. It’s heartbreaking.\n",

      "But I’m also afraid that being in a relationship with me might be *adding* to her emotional pressure and confusion. Still, the idea of breaking up terrifies me. I’m scared that if I walk away to “give her space,” she’ll eventually heal — but move on with someone else. I know this may sound selfish, but I want to remain in her life *as her partner*, not just as someone who helped her in a rough chapter.\n",

      "* Should I distance myself? Stay close but with limits?\n",
      "* How can I support her without emotionally draining myself?\n",

Hes a top priority in my life, I message him daily, and as soon as I wake up, I let him know what I’m doing all the time, we call every night before bed, I make him stuff all the time (letters, paintings, diy) all kinds of stuff, I try to go all out for holidays and bdays, like I really love him. Anyways we both got new jobs about two months ago and we work the same hours but different jobs, anyways so we don’t msg as much anymore or talk too much throughout the day due to both of us working, and it’s about a 45 min drive from his house to mine and he’s the only one with a vehicle, so we only see eachother on weekends, throughout the week I start to miss him and get upset because he’s so busy all the time and we barely get to talk, I usually express this Wednesday nights I’ll make a comment, Thursday goes the same so I’ll bring it up again, but Thursday night we get into a disagreement and then friday sucks and I finally see him Friday night or Saturday morning, anyways he works 8-4 and then he goes home he calls his friend while he smokes and then he uses the bathroom and does chores that’s about 2-2.5 hours and then he’ll go eat with his dad which a 1-1.5 and then he gets home and he showers which is another hour and it’s usually 930-10pm when he is done and he’ll call me and I’ll try to talk and then he falls asleep and it upsets me because we don’t talk or spend as much time together and I just miss him and want to talk to him and I feel like I make time for him and I’m a full time working single mother to my 1.5 year old daughter and I have no help from her bio dad so I do it on my own and I understand he’s busy but I want to not be so codependent on him, I want to be able to let the man breath because I know I’m clingy but it’s not in a bad way I just literally love and miss him and it causes arguments and I hate that and I want to stop fighting so please anything helps how do I fix this?  I also feel like I put a lot of time into him and our relationship and he doesn’t, and it’s not that he doesn’t do anything he does a normal amount. I do a lot tho, I go all out for bdays and holidays, constantly make him things, buy him stuff I think he’ll like, and I feel like I’m overly obsessed with him and I don’t wanna push him away from being too clingy. \n",

I live downtown also around trendy restaurants and bars, close to the sports arena, 2 bedroom, nice city view and back balcony as well. Immediately he started commenting on my stuff. My couch, my tv, my bed, all my stuff. As we were eating dinner money was brought up and he asked how much I make and I told him, and he said “shit!”. And so I asked the question back and he did not give me an answer, but he said I definitely make more than him, and I said “that’s okay, I make more than a lot of people”. It’s not so much about how much someone makes, but how can they manage it and to me he is responsible. He buys his cars cash, we don’t go out a lot and he’s a chef so we still eat well. The conversation got really awkward. That next morning he asked about my toothbrush, “that’s a $200 toothbrush?” I said yeah then he asked about my headphones and he asked how much those were and I told him. Jokingly I said “are you about to rob me?” And he said “no you’re just fancier than I thought”. I wanted to hear more about that and he said that he couldn’t see where he would fit into my life because as a man he’d like to support me but he didn’t know if he could provide more than what I have now. Fair. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I address this to him in a respectful way and tell him I don’t really care about the amount of money, it’s really how much debt/income, your spending habits, etc? He’s stuck on salary and he’s an old fashioned guy. For context we dated when we were 21/19 and he broke with me by playing Drake ft. Rihanna “Too Good” because he felt like he couldn’t support me then. We were kids. So I know this is a soft spot. \n",

      "Title: I (F40) feel extremely hurt and stressed by my boyfriend (M40) not prioritising us in the way I would like\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend (M40) and I (F40) have been together for 5+ years. In January last year he was dropping heavy hints and I told him to spit it out and he said he wanted to get married/move in together/have kids. I told him that's great, but he's done no emotional work in our relationship. I pointed out to him that I am the one who's setting up our dates, making sure we see each other once or twice a week, and bringing up hard conversations. I told him that if he wanted to get married, we'd need to have those hard conversations and he needed to be able to do the emotional work, because if he didn't, I eventually wouldn't, and the relationship would fail. I told him he needed to initiate these conversations. We talked about the different topics we needed to talk about, and I told him he would need to look into the issues other couples had run into and their solutions to inform our conversations. He listened to this and said we would have conversations every week. I said \"wow, that's a lot\", but said I would leave it with him, and wouldn't say anything else because this was now his domain and I would follow his lead. I make sure to let him know he can ask for help, but he needs to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "By April, I hadn't heard anything about it, so even though I said I wouldn't say anything else about it, I checked in with him.. He said he hadn't done anything. A few weeks later, he told me he was done, and gave me a notebook with questions written in it and his replies. The questions were the first hit when googling \"questions to ask before marriage\" and some were not even relevant to us. His replies were 1 or 2 sentences. I was disappointed and upset, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to ruin our upcoming trip. He proposed on that trip. I told him \"it's not a no\" but clarified it wasn't exactly a yes either. We talked about what I had expected from him. We talked about why. We went through the notebook and talked about the things in there and he made notes for what we need to talk about further. He promised we would talk every week. We come back from our trip and we do not talk every week.\n",

      "In September he does a finance talk. This is great! I'm excited. \"Okay, what's next? What's the plan? What else do we have?\" I say and, well, there's nothing. I leave the country to travel for a bit and he says he will work on it while I'm away. In December I ask him if he has anything. He doesn't have anything. I ask him if he knows what I'm asking for, why I'm asking for it, and we go over the reasons AGAIN. He says he understands now. We talk about potential resources. I told him I know it's hard, but it's hard for me too but I STILL DO IT, like it took me 2 weeks to bring up that very conversation. I point out to him that if this was HIS JOB he would have done it by now. I point out how hurtful it is that he's not prioritising it. He again promises to have talks every week. For the first week, it happens. He tells me he's been reading the Gottmann books, and we go through an exercise they have. The next two weeks I am traveling again. When I get back, I'm sick for a couple of weeks. His sister is visiting. There are x amount of reasons that there are no talks. Shortly after Valentine's day, I decide that's it and try to leave. He mollifies me by saying he's been reading the Gottmann books and we just haven't had the talks because xx reasons. I tell him he needs to COMMUNICATE and try and make up for the talks. He apologises and agrees. We start having our Gottmann exercises. It goes well for the first few weeks, then they start petering off from every week to every other week. It's been 3 weeks now without one. He also initiated one discussion about me moving in and we've done general stuff around that, but no other discussions since about me moving in and the things I told him he needed to follow up on, or any other discussions. He has gotten better at planning dates and making sure we spend time with each other every week. \n",

      "I'm so stressed about this. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying I need to leave this guy. I sometimes feel like just pushing him out of bed when he misses initiating a weekly discussion.  I know emotional work is hard for men, but it's hard for me too. I love him and he's actually great otherwise (apart from his sometimes terrible taste in music) - he's gentle, emotionally supportive, learned how to give massages so he could give them to me, my friends like him, he cooks, etc., and I do want to marry him IF HE COULD JUST DO THIS ONE THING. I don't feel like I'm a high-maintenance girlfriend. I don't ask for much. I'm asking for this because if we don't have this the relationship will fall apart eventually anyway, and I have been telling him this over and over again. I am so stressed. I don't want to nag at him about this, because he either pioritises this or he doesn't. I don't want to spend the rest of my life having to nag a husband to do things that I have pointed out over and over again are important for our relationship I don't know what to do. Should I try again to have another conversation or is 17 months really enough time to realise he will never ever ever prioritise what I  think is important for our relationship? Of course there's the added complication about our ages. He wants kids. I think they might be great. But my womb can't wait another 5 years for me to realise he will never get his shit together, then find another partner and have kids with him.\n",

      "Body text: I (19) and him (20) moved together approximetly 1,5 years ago. We are now almost a couple for 4 years and since we moved together we have I would say a lot of fights. Its always about something small, something not important but everytime we fight it drains me completely. I often cry without a reason and I cry everytime we have a fight. I started doubting our relationshop after a while because I just felt sad all the time. I was the happiest person when we werent fighting. I still love him but last year around november he told me that a few weeks prior he used an app similar to tinder but to find friends. He wanted to find friends in our area because we moved far away from our families and I understood that. Then he told me he first wanted to only text other men but he couldnt find people he could be friends with. Then he switched to find female and male friends but still not a lot of success. Then he switched to look only for women and he texted a lot of them he said. That was our first conversation about that and I wasnt very happy about him looking for female friends but I knew how bad he wanted friends and also he said that he has no contact to any of those women and that he deleted that app. So fast forward to a few days later where he confessed that thats not the whole story. He then told me he texted primarly beautiful women and also started conversation with compliments (I would rarely get compliments from him) so that already hurt me a little. But then he proceeded to tell me that he also asked some women for their instagram or snapchat but he had already unfollowed them. Then he told me that he had also told a few women that he is single but he apperently just wanted to see how they would react. He promised me he would never to such a thing again but obviously I lost a lot of trust in him. There was a lot more and I tried to forget these things but there was nothing that counted as real cheating. I still dont know if what he did is cheating so please tell me your opinion. Now almost 6 months later I still think about it and I am not sure if it was the right thing to completely forgive him. Just as backround knowledge: I dont talk to my parents anymore and also dont have any real friends who I could talk with about this and I think that thats also a reason why I stayed. I dont have anywhere to go if I break up with him.\n",

      "Title: I screwed up my first relationship, and I don’t know how to live with that.\n",
      "Body text: Hi everyone. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve been in my first ever relationship for about a year now. She’s also 20, and it’s her second relationship. Honestly, it was something really special to me – we had our ups and downs, sure, but in many ways, it felt close to perfect. Until I messed it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give some context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her last relationship, her ex betrayed her trust. He was constantly in contact with other girls behind her back, liking and saving revealing posts on Instagram and TikTok, and then gaslighting her by saying it was all “normal.” Over time, she lost trust in him completely and broke up with him. It really hurt her, and I knew that. She made it very clear early on that this kind of behavior was something she couldn’t tolerate again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here’s where I messed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, she was using my phone and ended up in the “Recently Deleted” folder in my gallery. She found a screenshot I had taken of some random girl on Instagram leaning over a table – not naked or anything, but obviously showing her butt in tight clothes. I had screenshotted it like a month ago, realized how dumb that was, and deleted it. But it was still there in the deleted folder. She was absolutely shocked and disappointed – like she said she would’ve never expected this from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, she also checked TikTok on my iPad and saw my search history. It included the names of some girls – some we had gossiped about at work, like an ex of a friend or someone who came up in conversation – but also one or two typical TikTok thirst-trap creators. I didn’t like, comment, or save anything, but the fact that I had searched them up made it look like I was obsessively seeking that kind of content behind her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it instantly reminded her of her ex and that she felt like I was no different. She told me she doesn’t see me the same anymore. That even if she gave me another chance, she’d never be able to fully trust me again. She also said she’d always remember this and be angry about it, that I ruined something that had so much potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, I completely own up to it. I told her I’m not trying to excuse what I did. It wasn’t out of lust or craving for attention – it was more of a dumb Jeffrey-brain moment, a mix of impulsiveness, curiosity, and gossip with coworkers. I know it sounds like a cliché excuse. But I swear I didn’t mean to hurt her. And now I’ve become the exact person she was afraid of.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things even harder – literally the day she saw all this, she flew out on a two-week trip with her parents. Before this all happened, I had agreed to stay at her place to watch her cat and water her plants while she’s away. So now I’m here in her apartment, alone, surrounded by memories of a relationship that feels like it’s already over. A place that used to feel safe and full of love now feels cold and heavy. I feel completely destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how I’m supposed to live with the guilt if she decides to end things when she comes back. I don’t know how to move on knowing I ruined something with someone who, honestly, felt perfect for me – loyal, principled, kind, beautiful inside and out. I know everyone says that about their ex, but she really was special. I didn’t cheat, but I broke her trust, and maybe that’s just as bad in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for reading. I’m open to any advice or words that might help. I really feel like I’m drowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I (20M) messed up my first relationship by having some inappropriate content/screenshots and TikTok searches, which triggered my girlfriend’s (20F) trust issues from her previous relationship. She found it right before a two-week trip and now doesn’t see me the same. I regret it deeply and am watching her cat while alone in her place, feeling crushed and lost. I don’t know how to forgive myself or fix anything.\n",

      "Body text: 3 days ago my girlfriend of 9 months and I met up for a drink, when we saw each other we hugged, we kissed we asked how each other has been the past few days. Maybe 30 minutes later I could feel that something was off, she wasn't talking as much and there wasn't that connection. One thing to keep in mind is that my girlfriend is an avoidant, she shows those traits in our relationship. While we were at the bar I popped off the bar and knew that there was something we had to discuss. I maybe didn't bring it up in the best way, I came back out and said \"So are we gonna talk about something because I can feel that something is off\" she replied with \"I think we are having so many problems\" she started rambling and explaining her feelings which I tried to comfort her, it ended up with her saying that \"I think I should break up with you\" I tried to keep it together for the whole conversation but at the end I did get a emotional. I told her that we can work through these problems. I hugged her and told her that \"it's okay\". She said she needed space to think about everything, which is respectable I understand that. She said \"I'll talk to you later\" and we went our seperate ways. I followed up with her that night with a short text saying \"Don't feel and pressure to reply, I understand and respect the fact that you need space. I just hope you're doing okay\" she replied with \"Yes \\*My name\\*, I hope your doing good to\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been about 3 days now and I still haven't heard anything from her. But I should keep in mind that she had a full day of university the following day and a school trip for a whole day in a different city.

      "  \n",
      "UPDATED: I am essentially looking at this like a break up, somethings to note that I guess is hopeful is that she still has photos of us together on her instagram, one of us kissing, one of us in the first month that we met.

      "Long story short, we broke up because she realized that i am very restrictive about myself, and I get into my head about, for example, going back home very soon, and this pattern is recurring. I consciously attempted to prolong our dates, but when the clock hit 7, i get anxious to get back home soon. Although my parents arent really calling me or asking me where I'm at.

I am not a risk taker. \n",

      "And it is not like, they still have a strong hold on me, but i get the anxiety sometimes to fight with my parents and imagine the consequences. I was never physically abused. It was mental really. It was the silent treatments and offloading the anger onto someone else that really got me to be anxiously attached. And to top it off, i was never really given a chance to make my own decisions and to fail and get back up and have real experiences. Now all i am stuck doing is routine. \n",

      "Me and my girlfriend have had a on and off relationship while in highschool and it has also been a little rocky in our early adulthood. She is a student who is getting into nursing, and I am a pre med student who opted to get my school payed for by the military. We have been together for around 4 years now but have had a couple breaks, because of me being dumb. I haven’t been the best boyfriend but I have made grown from my mistakes. We have recently been in a lot of arguments because she really wants to get engaged and start a family very soon (soon being married at like 22, kids by 23 atleast). Where the issue is I don’t feel like I’m ready for that. Since I joined the military (air guard) I have been set back in time. I really am just getting into college and I personally feel like taking those steps would be a lot for me especially if I do make it into med school. She also doesn’t want me going away to the college I have been looking forward to for my whole life, she’s told me many times she just doesn’t see us working out. I am just at a loss how to feel and definitely get bad anxiety from it. I’m young so I’m just trying to figure it all out!\n",

      "20M in a 2-year relationship with my 20F best friend. We’ve known each other since high school, share everything, and she truly feels one-of-a-kind. But the romantic/sexual side has faded—she says she’s less attracted to me now, puts in little effort, and admits she’s been lazy in the relationship. I’ve tried communicating and adjusting, but nothing really changes. She says she wants to stay long-term, but I’m unsure if I’m settling or holding on out of fear. Some days I want forever with her, others I feel done. Do I keep trying or walk away before resentment builds?\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend (17F) and I (17M) have been together for 2 years — one year long-distance and one year living together. It’s been a rollercoaster, and honestly, I’ve changed a lot for the better over time, but I’m at a point where I feel torn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in September, I made a mistake. It wasn’t cheating, but it was a serious lie. She almost left me over it, and her mom even sat me down to talk about it. I felt incredibly guilty and promised I’d change and work every day to earn her trust back. Since then, I’ve done everything I could to be the best version of myself — emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’ve been more patient, more giving, and constantly trying to support her through everything. Even before I had fully grown as a person, I helped her out of a difficult home situation. I supported her move-in, helped her find a job, and always tried to put her well-being first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got complicated when my mom eventually kicked her out. I chose to leave with her, and in the heat of the moment during an argument between me and my mom, things escalated. My mom lashed out at me physically — hitting me on the head and pulling my hair. My girlfriend intervened to protect me, but that led to a fight between them. Looking back, it was just a toxic mix of emotions. Everyone was in the wrong — my mom for lashing out, my girlfriend for escalating it, and me for not diffusing the situation better. But now my girlfriend is asking me to cut my mom off completely, and after losing my dad not long ago, it’s incredibly hard for me to just walk away from the only parent I have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my dad passed, my girlfriend and I were staying at a homeless shelter with her mom and siblings. My cousin later took us in, and for a while things felt more stable. But because of the fight with my mom, my mom’s mom (my nana) was staying downstairs at my cousin’s, and my girlfriend didn’t want me going down to see them. At first she allowed short visits, but eventually she stopped me from going down at all. One day my mom made a long drive just to see me, but I wasn’t allowed to go down and see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions really blew up one night during an argument when my girlfriend started throwing things and yelling. My nana came upstairs and calmly asked her to quiet down because it was late, but my girlfriend felt disrespected and snapped at her. She later asked me why I didn’t defend her. This became a common pattern — anytime she felt “disrespected” by someone (my cousin, my nana, etc.), she expected me to defend her no matter what, even if she was the one being harsh first. And if I didn’t, it became an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a time my friend came over after my dad passed, and we drank and smoked together. It was one of the first times I had laughed and felt a bit of peace since my dad’s death. My girlfriend said I left her for my friend (she’s in our room the room right next to he living room) and made a huge deal out of it, even though I was constantly checking in on her and she had been asleep for most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, things got so tense between her and my cousin that my girlfriend called her family to come pick us up. My cousin informed my nana, and the situation escalated so much that the police got involved. We got separated, but I convinced my cousin to take me to see her again during spring break. I wasn’t planning to break up with her — I just wanted to see her. But when the time came to return, things didn’t go as planned, and we ran away together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were truly homeless at that point, sleeping in parks at night. I couldn’t go with her to her mom’s shelter because I wasn’t her biological child and social services wouldn’t allow it. We had no options until my grandpa stepped in and helped us out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue that’s been hurting me lately is how my girlfriend made me unadd my step-sister. I’ve known her since I was 8 and she was 6 — she’s my family. But my girlfriend doesn’t accept that, claiming she’s just “a female best friend.” I even explained the whole family dynamic to her — how my stepdad raised them when their biological dad wasn’t around — and my whole family would back me up. Still, she told me to tell my stepbrother I didn’t want Hannah (my step-sister) in my life anymore. She’d even ask me if I was bothered by what she mad me do, also that her sister backed her up and her family usually backs her up even if it seems wrong sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, when I visited my mom and got home at 7 PM instead of earlier, my girlfriend blew up. My mom works nights and sleeps during the day, she was mad I didn’t come home at 10AM or 12PM and I was just happy to visit and reconnect. But she turned it into a problem. Later, my step-sister tried to add me on Snapchat, and I declined the request without blocking her. My girlfriend found out and flipped out, saying I was a bad boyfriend for not blocking her entirely. Her mom got involved too, saying “If my daughter’s ex added her and she didn’t block him, would you be mad?” — even though Hannah is my step-sister, not an ex. My girlfriend didn’t correct her, and I just stayed quiet to keep the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expects me to do everything with her — if I smoke a disposable without her, it’s an issue. She even comes to the bathroom with me. I don’t mind doing most things together, but I need my own space sometimes, and she struggles to understand that. On Mother’s Day, I simply texted my mom “Happy Mother’s Day,” and she got mad, saying her mom actually deserved it more. My mom has apologized for a lot of things, and I’m trying to rebuild that relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve made huge changes. I’ve been more honest, more stable, and more committed than ever. But sometimes my girlfriend still brings up the mistake I made a long time ago, even when I’ve expressed how deeply those old mistakes haunt me. I’ve done everything I can to earn forgiveness, but it still feels like I’m being punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part is that I love her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want her to be with anyone else. But I’m starting to feel like I don’t have freedom anymore. I’m being made to choose between her and my mom, and after losing my dad, that choice feels impossible. I’ve sacrificed so much, and part of me wonders if I’ll ever be able to fully have both love and peace at the same time.\n",

      "TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been through a lot — we were even homeless together at one point. I made a mistake early on, but I’ve done everything I can to be better. She wants me to cut my mom off, and after losing my dad, that feels impossible. I’ve changed so much, but she still brings up old mistakes and expects me to do everything with her, even giving up people I’ve loved and known for years. I love her deeply, but I’m starting to feel suffocated. I don’t know how to choose between love and family, or if I even should.\n",

      "Title: How do I [F18] rekindle my relationship with my bf? [M18]\n",
      "Body text: I (F18) have been with my bf (M18) for about 4 month exactly today. In the beginning of our relationship, everything was amazing. He used to be head over heels for me even though I had went after him first. He met my parents and I had met his. He would make me feel loved. But for context, hes a high school wrestler and hes pretty good at what he does. Naturally, this meant that he’d be pretty busy with practices everyday and tournaments every weekend which takes up most of his time. This also meant that he’d cancel plans last minute and not be able to hang out with me weeks on end even though he says and promised that we can. He’d also not respond to my texts for hours on end. I have anxious attachment, so naturally I freak out and jump to the worst possible conclusion of him losing feelings or me not being a priority for him. In the beginning, he’d always be the one to text me first but now I’m the one always reaching out. I’d let it slide bc I saw the amount of work he puts in for wrestling bc his college and future career depend on it. Before we got together, he was reluctant to start anything with me because he knew wrestling would be his number one priority but we both agree that our careers come first and that’s why we got together with that understanding. We got together around January and things were fine up until mid March. Thats when I noticed a switch in energy. At first when I talked to him, he said it was bc he was burnt out and tired of everything which was under stable as he puts a lot of dedication and time into what he does. But my friends and everyone else I go to for reassurance when I overthink convince me that he doesn’t like me anymore and I let that get to my head and he’s left trying to reassure me and clean up the mess. In all our past fights, he always said that he loved me and that he’d try to make it work but last night we got into our worst one yet. In our last big fight 2 weeks ago, he said that he still loved me but he doesn’t feel the same feelings as the beginning of the relationship. For context this fight started because we were supposed to hang out yesterday after my senior prom as he has his last wrestling tournament half way across the country the next day and wouldn’t be able to see him for a couple days after. One of his friends had texted him saying that I was going to breakup with him even though I never said so.  From this, I realize that the main reason we’ve had this ongoing unresolved problem rhat comes up all the time is because I involve my friends in my relationship problems when I need reassurance and I go insane from my anxiety and that we don’t spend enough private quality time together. The only reason I want to salvage this is because his wrestling dies down after this weekend meaning that he’d have more time. As I was typing this I realized that I couldn’t post any screenshots. But long story short, he sends me a screenshot of one of his friends telling him that I was going to break up with him after the dance but I really wasn’t. He said he wasn’t going to deal with it regardless whether I said it or not bc he’s sick and tired or my friends and other people treating him like hes the bad guy for not making time for me. He said that he doesn’t know if he lives me anymore and that it feel like his love is starting to fade away. He said that theres still something and that at this point he didn’t know how much was left and that trying again felt like beating a dead horse bc things get slightly better when we try but fade after a bit. I had asked him why he lost feelings. He replied that it was a mix of my overthinking, the arguments, my friends getting involved, and the lack of time together. He said that it feels more like a good friendship and that he’s just going through the motions of a relationship everyday to keep it going.  I replied by asking him whether he ever actually meant it when he said he lived me in the past to which he replied that he did. He said that this loss of feelings only occurred within the last couple weeks of our relationship. I also replied by telling him that I still wanted to give it another shot bc I was doing better with my overthinking and that after this weekend he wouldn’t have any more tournaments for a while which means that we’d have more time together. He said that he’d talk to me about it face to face when he’s back on Sunday and decide after that. After this convo, I just don’t believe that he could just lose love like that bc love doesn’t just fade away that quickly. Can I salvage this?\n",

      "TL;DR: My bf said he’s starting to love me less and that the feelings aren’t there anymore as they were in the beginning and that it was trying to feel like a good friendship and that he can’t get it to come back even though he tried. I’m thinking that it’s bc we never had any time together and that my friends got too involved and that I overthink. I feel like if I stopped telling my friends stuff and spend more time with him since his wrestling tournament die down after this weekend I can bring back the spark. \n",

      "Body text: I 25F am dating my bf (25M) of 5 years and we have been through a lot. He recently quit his job to work on his start-up and ever since things have been going downhill. A) We hare back to being in a long distance relationship B) We have started fighting a lot and for some reason it has always been me being at the receiving end of things. Lately it has just been constantly feeling like i am the one fighting for the both of us. Coming to the core issue of it all- he seems very agitated and irritated at everything and I am being used as a punching bag to vent out. His startup is facing roadblock day in and out and I truly understand. I know this is HIS PASSION . and i want him to ace it but I also know its going to take time at least for the scale up he is aiming at. But he has been very impatient about it. Often times our phone calls would go on about \"I need an income soon\" but hey everything doesn't come at just the start , they take time . and this impatience boils up and he yells/ fights with me. But i don't feel bad I know he is going through a lot and I want to support him. But it is VERY OVERWHELMING , mind you I am doing a postgraduate course myself and sometimes i just break down . I am exhausted and I am tired. I have cut off going out with friends cause I dont want him to feel left out cause he cannot . Things have gotten to a point where he has said hurtful stuff like - Why do you make everything about yourself ? , For example - Whenever he is stressed if i offer comforting words - \"Dont sympathise for me , I am not a loser\". Cut to 2 hours later he would come and apologies'. and when I do not probe him further on whatever is bothering him - \"you dont even care \", and god forbid if i ask a question - \"YOU CANNOT HELP ANYWAYS , WHY TALK ABT IT\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot take it anymore. I have to measure each and every word I say to him . I am so afraid all the time of what he may interpret it to. ITS SUFFOCATING ME AND MAKING ME NUMB. All these constant fights day after day after every time he promises -\"I wont take it out on you\" Lately it has made me reconsider this entire relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "Please advice on how I should tackle this ? No matter what the outcome of our relationship . I would only and always wish the best for him. Please do keep in mind it is indeed a very tough situation he is respect but it is hampering my mental health and he doesn't realise it at all.\n",

I’ve sacrificed a lot to support him, but it’s now harming my mental health. He apologizes after outbursts, but the cycle continues. I’m reconsidering the relationship and need advice on how to handle this.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend (22M) of almost 5 years gets very defensive when I (21F) cry\n",
      "Body text: I’m a very depressed person and I cry A LOT. Often everyday. I also quit using nicotine a few weeks ago so I have been crying plenty more than usual (like for several hours at a time). Needless to say, I am just very sad. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mother is very emotionally intelligent and has always been extremely supportive when I am upset. My boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a family that was not so supportive and would meet displays of emotion with anger. We’ve been together for almost five years and I could count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen him cry— he definitely sees it as a sign of weakness and never wants me to look at him when he does. Because of his upbringing, he has no real ability to empathize and no skills with processing emotions. I believe he’s also been taught to think that anger is a normal and rational response when somebody is sad. It also seems as though there was lots of passive aggression in his household growing up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every single time I cry, he takes it personally and gets angry with me, or at least gets very very defensive. I always try to explain that it really has nothing to do with him and it’s not a personal attack, I just want some comfort or emotional support. Like, for example, when I cry about being lonely, he thinks I’m “giving him shit” for not spending enough time with me. Usually by the end he understands where I’m coming from, but it always has to come after a huge nasty fight where I usually end up just comforting him. He seriously has zero empathy when he sees me sad and is often very very mean, mimicking me and using an angry tone which obviously makes me cry harder. I can also see his face harden each time, like his eyebrows furrow in anger; when I tried to explain to him that my mothers face would soften when she comforted me, he genuinely didn’t understand what I meant by that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even when I was crying on the one year anniversary of my father’s death, no comfort. Not even a hug until I ask for one. It was so disheartening because it was the exact same thing as the year prior when my father died. My crying turned into an argument. When I asked why he didn’t comfort me, he said it was because I hadn’t blown my nose, and he was really grossed out. That was one of the most painful exchanges we’ve had. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love him so much and told him I’d rather work really very hard to understand each other and make this work rather than break up. I can see how these patterns come from his childhood and it just makes me want to hug little six-year-old him so bad. He’s never been allowed to be in touch with his emotions so of course it would be difficult. He’s not a bad guy at all. He’s fantastic and I know he cares about me. It’s just so discouraging for this pattern to continue when I have been begging him for years to please just offer me some emotional support sometimes and stop inserting himself into every situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also says he feels helpless when somebody is crying. He truly does not know how to provide comfort or make a safe space. I’ve tried to show him what that kind of comfort feels and looks like in all the times I’ve done it for him, but he never seems to pick up on it. He says he doesn’t know what to say, which makes me sad because I’m deeply hurt to see somebody upset and the words just come naturally at that point. I feel like that’s the nature of empathy. He truly lacks empathy. \n",

      "EDIT: there are a few things I feel inclined to clarify. Although I cry often, I do not expect to be comforted every single time I cry. The majority of these times are when I’m in the shower, or doing household chores alone. It is not normal for me to cry for hours. This is a recent response to withdrawal and is temporary. He also knew I’d face depressive symptoms when I quit, but encouraged me anyways because he understands it will be beneficial in the long run. I do NOT expect quitting to “fix” me. I do NOT expect my boyfriend to “fix” me. If that’s what you gather from this, I urge you to reread. A major part of depression is feeling like your emotions are burdensome to those around you and I very much experience that. I do a lot of journaling. The only time I will cry to my boyfriend is when I think it’s something we should address, or when it’s something huge and devastating, like my father’s death. Telling me I’m exhausting to be around doesn’t make a positive impact on anybody. I only want positive change. I do not expect him to fully understand my emotions either, but this is what you must understand— he has NEVER comforted me for any reason, because he has hardly ever received comfort. His response is almost always anger. I’m not asking for him to be my constant emotional support. I’m more so looking to HELP him (not force him) feel comfortable with emotions in general. I think it’s also worth noting that he has said on multiple occasions his favorite thing about me is the way I work through our emotional discussions. I wouldn’t be asking for this advice if we hadn’t both acknowledged it’s something we’d like to work on together. Please be kind. \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 2: I hope one day we, as a society, can move away from blaming women for everything and move towards providing help for men who are in clear emotional distress. This post was not made in regards to my mental health. My crying is not the issue, as my boyfriend wants to be better equipped to help me when I am sad. He wants to be able to express emotions as comfortably as I do. This is where I’m seeking advice and nowhere else. Thank you to the kind people who understood that. \n",

      "Earlier this year in February, I broke up with my boyfriend of a 2.5 years. The main issue was that he didn’t want to take the next steps in our relationship. I have a house deposit saved, and for the past couple of years, I’ve been holding off on buying a property because we talked about doing that together. He owns a home, and we had discussed selling it and purchasing a new one jointly — a place we could build a life in. But it just never progressed, and I got tired of waiting. So I left and moved out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, I had regrets — I really do love him — and we talked it out. We agreed to give the relationship another shot and start couples therapy to work through our issues. I moved back in about a month later, and we’ve had around six sessions of therapy since then. He says he finds them helpful. Personally, I find them frustrating. It feels like I’m doing therapy just to get him to talk about things that should already matter in a long-term relationship — like buying a house, planning for the future, or even celebrating milestones together. I feel like I’m trying to fix a relationship where the root problem is one-sided reluctance to move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I was clear about when we reconciled was wanting to be engaged by June this year. I even found a ring I absolutely loved with my mum — it’s $3000, which is significantly less than the $8000 we had previously discussed as a budget. I told him it would mean a lot to me if he bought it. His response? \"We're not in a good place right now.\" That hit hard — it felt like a convenient excuse to stall again, rather than actually move forward with intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The property situation has gone nowhere, too. He has every second Friday off work (today included), and we’ve talked about getting real estate agents in, fixing a few things up, and starting the sale process. It’s been months and he’s done nothing — no calls, no quotes, no prep. I know for a fact he’ll do nothing today either. It makes me feel like I’m the only one working toward the life we supposedly both want.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is where it just gets more disappointing. Last year I completed two Master’s degrees while working full-time. It was a huge achievement for me — mentally, emotionally, everything. He didn’t plan anything to celebrate. Eventually, after I told him I felt hurt, he gave me a bunch of flowers. That was it. Last week, my parchments arrived in the mail — another perfect chance for him to do something, even something small, to acknowledge it. But again: nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve told him that having a home together is deeply important to me. Not just in a material sense, but in the sense of building a shared life. It’s part of how I feel safe and secure in a relationship. But right now, I feel like I’m stuck. Like I’m waiting for a man who doesn’t actually want the same future as me — or is too passive to act on it.\n",

Got back together a week later, did couples therapy, moved back in, but not much has changed. I found the ring I want and asked him to buy it — he stalled. He hasn’t made any moves to sell his property so we can buy one together. He didn’t celebrate me graduating with two Master’s degrees. I feel stuck and unvalued, like I’m doing all the emotional work. Should I walk away for good?\n",

      "We’re both in college, although we go to different colleges and don’t really live close together. I recently started work experience, a necessary part of my college course (health and social care) in a care home. It’s about a 20 minute drive away from where I live and away from where my boyfriend lives. By recently, I mean I started last week and only went in for 4 hours Friday and 4 hours Saturday. This is an incredibly new experience for me. I live in the middle of nowhere and have never had anything close to a job before. I live with my grandparents, and my grandad drives me to and from the care home. Me and my boyfriend, for the whole time we’ve been together, have gone to each other’s houses every other weekend. He’ll come to mine one weekend, and I’ll go to his the next. He stays at mine from Thursday evening up until Saturday evening, since he works on a Sunday and needs to go home for that. I stay at his from Thursday evening to Sunday evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "This weekend is supposed to be my turn to go to his. However, because of work experience, I don’t feel like i’ll be able. Like I said, this is brand new, and my grandad is driving me there. My boyfriend doesn’t like that I don’t want to come to his this weekend because of work experience. He said I should just take the bus from where he lives to the town the care home is in. This sounds plausible, except the thing is that I have NEVER taken the bus alone. I’ve never had to take the bus. In the town I grew up in, everything was in walking distance and all my friends lived close together. The place I live now is in the middle of nowhere, and my grandad drives me everywhere because the only bus that comes here comes once a week on a Wednesday in the afternoon. I have anxiety disorder, and trying something brand new out of the blue is terrifying. I had an anxiety attack just thinking about starting work experience, and my boyfriend had to calm me down through that. He knows how bad my anxiety is, and yet he’s pushing for me to try something completely new on top of still adjusting to another thing that is completely new to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was telling him this, and that I just need to get used to this new experience first before trying something else new, and he got even madder. He said I should be able to push through the anxiety for him, and that he always comes to mine on a Thursday evening even though he’s exhausted after a long day of college. I told him that he knows how bad my anxiety gets, and he’s seen plenty of my anxiety attacks over something completely small and mundane that he would find easy or trifling at the most. He reiterated that he always goes out of his way for me and I should be able to push through my anxiety for his sake. He offered to even take the bus with me the first time to show me it will be alright. I told him that I still didn’t want to. Work experience is a brand new thing for me and I want to focus on adjusting to that first before stepping even further out of my comfort zone that I already was. He just kept getting madder and madder at me, swearing even more with every text. I said that whenever we argue like this, I always get scared that we’re going to break up. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he wanted to break up with me. He said he didn’t and that he really loved being with me. He just wanted me to come to his this weekend because he likes spending time with me. I said I love spending time with him too, but that I just wasn’t prepared to try one new things after another. I need time to adjust to a schedule before immediately trying new thing after new thing. He then said that I best be prepared for us to get nasty with each other because “we’re always horrible to each other after not seeing each other for a while”. I told him that I wouldn’t continue the conversation with him while he was pissed off at me, because he gets scary and horrible when he’s mad at me. He’s often mad at me for trivial things, and it is terrifying. Especially when he’s mad at me whilst we’re actually with each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "An example I can give is when he wanted to bake cookies with me, but I honestly wasn’t really feeling up to it in that moment and told him as much. He got upset and asked if I could at least stay with him in the kitchen whilst he baked. I happily agreed and went down with him. He then assumed that because I was now in the kitchen with him, I’d help him bake now. I told him I just didn’t want to, and he got mad and told me to go upstairs then and leave him alone. I got really sad and started making my way upstairs when he knocked something off the shelf whilst grabbing ingredients, and I rushed back down to help him. He had spilled some pasta, so I grabbed the sweeping brush to help him clean it up. He pushed the brush away and scooped the pasta up with his hands, and I audibly sighed. I said I just wanted to help, put the brush away, and went upstairs. He immediately came storming up the stairs, flung the door open, and yelled “slam my fucking door again and you’ll see what happens”. I was terrified. My mum did that stuff to me when I was younger, and the stuff that would ‘happen’ is that she would scream and hurt me. He knew this. I told him he was acting like my mum. He yelled back that if he was acting like my mum, then he’d be abusive. And that he is not abusive. He often tells me that he isn’t abusive and to stop acting scared of him whenever I flinch at sudden movement. I don’t flinch because of him, he’s never done anything to hurt me ever. I flinch because of what I went through as a child, which he KNOWS. He KNOWS what I went through and still tries acting like I’m portraying him as an abuser. I’m not, because he isn’t abusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I told him that I wouldn’t continue the conversation, I put my phone on do not disturb and went off to take my mind off of things. I came back a bit later to see this text from him: “Don't come over this weekend because you acting like im a fucking monster whenever I have any fucking emotions and not just rolling over to you”. I don’t understand why he’s like this. He used to be the absolute sweetest boy on the planet. Now we’re arguing all the time over trivial things. I absolutely do not want to leave him. I want us to find the root of our issues and work this out. I need us to figure things out. I need us to last. I guess my question is what the hell can we do to resolve our current issue and to stop arguing all the time?\n",

      "I  need some advice. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2,5 years and we had a really rough time recently. He avoids difficult conversations and has been dishonest in the past, which triggered my anxiety and made me lash out several times. Everything was fine until one big topic came up last year and since then it went uphill...I have a lot of trust issues and I have to work on them, I know. But his unhonesty to prevent uncomfortable discussions didn't help, so I stayed anxious. I often doubted his love because he didn't treat me the way I needed or the way he promised. Because of his unhonesty and his passivity, I would lash out and say mean and hurtful things because I was hurt myself...and I know it's wrong. I work on that. But his avoidance, not stepping up and digging his emotions away make it very hard for me to communicate in a proper way. I tried to communicate nicely, if that didn't help, I get angry...but now I just... didn't lash out and was more understanding. Because I couldn't bear his passivity anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past he was very loving, caring and gave me the love I need. It was the man of my dreams and he gave me a lot of reassurance. Even with his passivity, he tried to be understanding, as good as he could... but that went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would make promises and break them. He was not reliable often times because he often forgets things. I didn't feel like a priority. He liked half-naked girls on Instagram and didn't take accountability...he actually rarely did because he is hiding to prevent difficult conversations and then doesn't say anything. He represses his emotions and it makes so difficult to communicate. He has some traumas as well...Because I was hurt of his behavior, he told me several times that maybe he is not good enough for me...I am so sorry...\n",
      "\n",
      "I would cry a lot and he would reassure me that he loves me and would never leave me. It was difficult to trust because of his previous lies but he told me - I just have to trust him. And he needed to find out why he was acting more and more distant. He didn't know why, he had to figure out. Well, he showed me the last days that he really forgot about me. And I was so hurt that I needed some space. First, he contacted me but yesterday I didn't hear anything from him. Today I called him and he told me that he figured out why he was distant...he thinks he probably lost feelings for me and doesn't know whether he wants to continue this relationship. He is unsure about it. I understood but I cried and I am so anxious now...he will visit me today after work and we will talk. I am so anxious about this relationship, I thought we will be together, we loved each other so much. We wanted a future together. I know, I have a lot of things to work on but he has traumas as well, which he really needs to adress...I don't know what to do, I want us to stay together. What should we or I do? What should I say?

To cut the long story short, I visit my mom every day and I’m often at my mom’s while we message, he says say hi to your mom and I say say hi to your friend.

My mom asks me do I even know who he’s travelling with and I really don’t have a clue who this mystery person is.

I decide to jokingly push for a selfie with the friend, with the convo ending with him saying he feels he is pushed to prove something and that didn’t sit well with him.

Now I feel he is purposefully concealing something that’s so silly. I am at a loss of what to do or say.

      "Body text: Me F(22) and my boyfriend M(27) have been together for a year and a few months now, recently we moved in together because of my toxic relationship with my parents but i feel like our connection and chemistry overall has altered. Its true that we have been together not for long but we do a lot of things together. To give you some info, im still in uni, next year ill finish my RN school, and he works as a freelancer. He does bring the bacon home and I’m currently waiting to get employed by a store close to our home so i can pay utilities and groceries along with him. This was our deal when he offered me to move in with him. We had our ups and downs along the way and frankly i don’t have many friends, maybe one that i feel close to, with whom i can share my experience with, but i feel he’s being mean sometimes and i cant tell if its toxic behaviour or not. Whenever i bring up something that might bother me he gets very defensive and slightly aggressive. Not to me like hitting or so, but adopts a really passive aggresive position toward me and the problem itself rather than being patient and trying to figure it out. This led me to shutting myself down most of the times i have something to object. Also most of the times after we are intimate he doesn’t cuddle me, he speaks loudly when something i did bothers him even if its not a big deal. Don’t get me wrong, most of the travel i’ve done this past few months were paid mostly by him and he does pay when we go out or so, but i feel neglected in a way. I would give up all the travelling if he were to be more sensitive and attentive towards me, giive me a small gift from time to time or care for the stuff i bring up to him. I’m sorry for my english, its not my first language. Can you give me some advice ? What should i do? I feel alone most days and honestly i might go back home if this things continue.\n",

      "Hello, 25F here. The guy 26M I'm dating is a good human being. We've been dating for almost 3 years. Hard working and takes care of his family. However, he grew up with a single mother and had a troubling childhood in the sense he didn't have the stability in his home that children need.\n",

      "He doesn't initiate deep conversations and even when I do he will shut it down quickly saying repetitive stuff like, it'll be okay, I'm here. He shows love through stuff like dropping me home late at night or helping me out with my office work, all of which I have to ask for him first because he is so unaware of what is going on in my life. Is it childish of me to want a boyfriend/partner who is aware or interested in what Is going on in my life? \n",

      "Title: Boyfriend’s (M18) mom doesn’t approve of me (F20) but has never met me\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years, but his mom doesn’t accept me and I don’t think it’s just because of religious differences. I used to do tarot readings when I first started high school, long before I ever met him. His family is very religious ( he’s a Christian and I’m Buddhist) and when his mom found out about that part of my past, she was really upset and told him to stay away from me. I understand where she’s coming from, since those things can be seen as going against her beliefs. But I had already stopped doing tarot before we even became serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We met in high school during my junior year and his sophomore year. At first, we were just friends and hung out a few times in May. Things became more serious around August of my senior year, we’d walk home from school together and really started building a strong connection. But when his mom found out, she got angry and made sure he didn’t walk with me anymore or spend time with me. He’s told me how she acts cold or petty whenever she knows we’re talking or sees the gifts I’ve given him. One Christmas, I gave him matching plaid pajamas, and when she saw them, she said, “Why don’t you go live with my name? She can buy all your clothing.” I laughed when he told me, but deep down, it hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She doesn’t like that we still talk or even that he sees me briefly when I pick up my sister from school. I graduated a year before him, and he’s graduating this year (2025). She works in the school district, and while I was still a student, she told one of my teachers or counselors that she disapproved of our relationship and would never accept it. I felt so humiliated, I cried after hearing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, he showed me a message from her where she said she’ll never approve of our relationship, that I’m not meant for him, and that if he wants to be with me, it won’t be allowed under her roof. She said he has to choose between me and her, that he won’t make her happy if I’m in his life. She even said she’ll continue to spoil him, but never with me around. We’re only about two and a half years apart in age, and she knows that, but that’s never been an issue for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I haven’t really talked about is the fact that I graduated high school a little later than most people. I came to the U.S. when I was six, and because of my late birthday, I didn’t start elementary school until I was seven. That pushed my school timeline a bit, it’s just part of my story (for the title).\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we talk every single day. He’s always been loving, supportive, and constant. One night, he even called me crying. He said he doesn’t know what to do, that he doesn’t want to have to choose between me and his mom. Hearing that broke my heart. He told me he wants to invite me to his graduation, and while I appreciate that deeply, I feel nervous. I know I’ll see his mom there, and I know how she’ll react. He’s also having a graduation party, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll be invited. I understand why but it still hurts. It’s painful because we live just five minutes apart, but we’ve never been able to see each other outside of school except for a few moments in the parking lot when I pick up my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went an entire summer without seeing him, and now that graduation is approaching, I’m preparing for another summer apart. Lately, especially this past week, I’ve felt overwhelmed with sadness. I’ve cried a lot and started acting distant with him not because I blame him, but because the weight of his mom’s disapproval is just so heavy on my heart. What hurts the most is that his mom has never even met me. She doesn’t know who I am she’s judging me based on my past and on assumptions about my beliefs. And I don’t know what I did to deserve that. I’m his first girlfriend, his first love. I just want the chance to be seen for who I really am, to be with him. \n",

      "Body text: I’ll try to keep this short. I (19) decided to drop off some stuff at my mom’s house, and I walked into my sisters (17) bedroom to say hi just to see her laying down with her ex (16). I seriously tried to keep my chill, but this guy literally got expelled from my high school because of their relationship. I blocked him on everything from her phone to keep them seperate. She always told me she would never get back with him, and always was grossed out by him. The fact she’s back with him after everything? She went to therapy because of him. He texted me that I’m a “faggot” and told me he would break my nose. I had to report him to the cops. This is absolutely unbelievable in my opinion. The fact that I haven’t even covered half of the stuff he’s done should show why this is crazy. I have no clue what to do. I’m going to just give up on her, she’s on her own with this one. But, since she’s my sister I genuinely have no clue what to do now. \n",

      "Body text: Me ‘M23’ and my girlfriend ‘F21’ have been together for almost 4 years now, and we met in a very vulnerable place in both of our lives which caused us to lean on each other so much, and were both very clingy, always together, telling each other we miss one another even though we just saw each other, it felt like the honeymoon phase lasted for a long time, we were both very different from who we are now.  We fell for each other very fast and had no one else to fall back on, we’ve been living together for about 3 years, and I always planned on asking her to marry me, and she wants the same.  But recently I’ve been finding myself and realizing all the things I want out of life.  I don’t want kids which is one of the main problems in our relationship, as we’ve talked about it multiple times since she wants kids but we both have kind of avoided the conversation and told each other that we’re too young to be worrying about that, we love each other very much and always figured we’d cross that bridge when we got there. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel I’m finally happy with who I am and what I want to be, I take care of myself, working out, and dieting, I want to travel the world and maybe even end up living in a different country that I like, one of my goals is to go skydiving, I absolutely love horror films.  I know I have one life and I want to make the absolute most of it, especially since my childhood was spent in a bubble my parents created as a Jehovah’s Witness, I left when I was 18, they took my car and I’ve been on my own since.  I’ve always been terrified of being myself until now. \n",
      "\n",
      "She wants kids, I know she does, she has kind of let herself go and gained a lot of weight, always wanting donuts, never going to the gym with me, she hates scary movies because it makes her anxious so she never ever watches with me, which I try to watch her comedies and reality tv shows, always putting in effort so we can watch something together.  she wants to travel but wants to stay close to her family living wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I’ve just been kind of stressed lately, the longer we’re together the more she expects to get married but the longer we’re together the less and less I feel I want it even though that’s what we always talked about, and I know that telling her my thoughts have changed will break her heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just genuinely scared of hurting her, I love her very much and want only the best for her, but I feel she’s noticed me pulling away recently.

      "\n",
      "I’m so thankful for everything we’ve been through together, her family has treated me like a part of them and don’t regret any of what we’ve been through, but I think I’m ready to go out on my own, which is absolutely terrifying since I don’t have family in my life, I would have no one, completely starting over, and it would be a long and painful transition as we live together, have a joint bank account, have always thought we would be together forever.  I just know it would break her heart to pieces and I’m genuinely scared she won’t recover.  \n",

      "Title: My 18 yo (M) boyfriend is so negative and down in the dumps. I 18 (F) have tried to help, but need more help.\n",
      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been together for around 3 months, I care for him a lot. One thing has become a recurring issue though, his anger. (I will also admit that I am very much like him in some of these actions, but I have managed to keep it contained and know how to control it. ) He tends to get angry at small things, but he doesn’t let that anger go. Instead, he lets the small things continue to add up. One example, he loves bowling and we go pretty much every week.. He gets very frustrated anytime he does not get a complete strike, which i don’t understand simply because I’m happy to get 6 pins. Anyways, he got frustrated and started to basically throw the rest of his balls and did not care anymore. He continued to be mad in the car ride home, his car was making a strange creaking noise, which he also cursed at. I usually sit in silence when he’s like this, as a trauma response because i don’t know how to deal with angry people. A couple hours later he was still upset and laying on my floor at this point, banging his hand and his head. I try to coach him through this and offer my support, asking him how he feels and why. But he always responds with “i don’t know”. He’s told me that he has no thoughts in his head, at all (which is wild to me as an ADHD person lol) and simply doesn’t know why he’s upset or how he’s truly feeling. I feel as though he does have thoughts, he just suppressed them as a trauma response. One thing i’ll mention is that his mom is quite manipulative, he lives at home with both of his parents. She tends to say things about how he’s not doing this or that good enough, especially using religion to guilt trip him (saying he’s not being religious enough or something). I want to help because I know this anger is deeply rooted and most likely he’s just a boiling volcano with a cap covering it (if the analogy doesn’t make sense i mean like pretending it’s not there, when it VERY CLEARLY is.) This is all quite jumbled but overall I would just like tips on things to say maybe or how to coach him through these feelings. Oh and also he doesn’t like to cry, because he says that other people have it worse than him so he shouldn’t feel bad. Which I tell him that he is very much allowed to feel however he feels, he’s human. Anyways, thanks for the long read lol, just want to offer my support instead of leaving. \n",

      "Body text: A few months ago, my boyfriend told me that he felt sad because he believed we didn't have much in common with each other. I thought it was strange and disagreed because we bond over many similar subjects, such as our love for history, science, movies etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "He clarified that what he meant was that we didn't have many shared hobbies together. Which, I would have to agree because aside from hanging out with each other on dates, we kind of leave each other to do our own hobbies. I wasn't bothered by this arrangement because like I said, we still had a lot in common and hung out often.\n",
      "\n",
      "But clearly, he was bothered by it so I set out to make some changes. Two of his biggest passions are the gym and playing video games. It seemed like it helped out at first. He appeared really excited when he helped me build a gaming PC and started playing games with him. He also seemed happy when I joined the same gym as him and was teaching me how to use all the machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually really liked it, and a lot of our dates started involving going to the gym together. Things seemed good for a while. More recently, my boyfriend told me that he was upset and stressed out about something, so he asked if we could go out to an arcade to take his mind off things. This was pretty late, like past 9, so all the small arcades in our area were either closed or about to. I suggested that maybe we go to the gym, which he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, I noticed that he had a very sour expression on his face. Like he was in pain and really didn't want to be there. Actually, that whole night I noticed that he hardly spoke to me and would give very short or one word responses. I knew that he was upset from the get go and didn't expect him to be cheerful or anything, but it almost seemed like my presence was just making him feel worse. That's the way I interpreted it at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that maybe he received really bad news, or something serious happened to him. I tried to ask him about it, but he insisted that he was fine and nothing serious happened to him. So, I thought that maybe it was just that he faced one bad luck situation after another with the arcade being closed, which left him more upset than he needed to be. Still, just in case, I asked him if he really wanted to hang out that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then admitted he was upset because he STILL felt like we didn't have enough shared hobbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very shocked and confused to hear that because that night, all we tried to do was stuff he liked. We literally tried to find an arcade and then went to the gym. I was genuinely confused because aside from those two things, I have never known him to participate in anything else as much. He literally goes to the gym every day and games almost every day. (whether I join in or not)\n",
      "\n",
      "I even asked in that moment what other hobbies/interests was he talking about. What else did he feel like I was missing out on? He said \"I don't know, but that's just how I feel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on I actually spoke to a few of my male friends asking why my boyfriend would feel this way. (I thought maybe this is a predominantly male issue) They suggested that maybe he resents that I'm not on the same \"level\" as him for his hobbies. For instance, I'm not an avid gamer and not as skilled as him in the game. He might also dislike that I'm not on his same level fitness-wise, like he wishes he had a \"powerlifter girlfriend\" or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if that's the real issue going on. Personally, I think that resentment is a part of it, but that maybe my boyfriend doesn't like that I didn't \"naturally\" get interested in his hobbies. He had to tell me that he wished I was, which got me to participate in them.\n",

      "Body text: Hey guys I’m a (23M) and my girl is (20F) we’ve been together for about a year and 8 months now. This was the greatest relationship I was in she always reciprocated and we felt as if this love was mutual and not like one from our generation. Loyalty respect no toxicity. She’s amazing and has all the qualities I want we worked thru so many things together that we thought would break us but came out stronger. The biggest thing was when I was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. For the past year I was enduring heavy chemotherapy and it changed how I looked and made me very nauseous and tired. We weren’t talking as often but we still made time for eachother and it was during that time that I started having problems and noticing she was distancing herself from me but whenever I’d come out and complain about it she would say things are just tough and that she’s sorry and will do better. Some of these things are replying hours later, dissappearing without knowing where she is for 3+ hrs. I felt hurt when she would make me feel like not a priority in her life and one day I was the in the hospital waiting to talk to her all day and she decided to call me at the end of her night when I was already tired and ready to sleep. This was when I told myself it’s time to pull my love back and start focusing on myself. A week later she noticed it and was like I want my man back. But this is the only way I won’t feel hurt giving 100% when someone gives 60% for so long. So I ended up matching her energy and she had a problem with it. Fast forward we worked on it and I was healed from cancer a couple months ago and started growing my hair back and my life is slowly returning to me. I’m going to the gym and gained 20lbs I’m looking and feeling good. But now I got so used to the distance that she gave me that I’m starting to distance myself and focus on my own self because I don’t want to feel hurt when I demand something but she says sorry and doesn’t change. She also said to me hey when you get better I hope you never change on me. How can I keep loving someone that I don’t feel compatible with anymore. She doesn’t love me how I wanna be loved. I’m always feeling lonely in this relationship. The things I love to do she never makes initiative to do with me so I just do it alone now like watching movies or shows, going out together cute romantic dates that I’d want to go on with her. I feel as if I’m in love with the potential and idk but I want to leave I feel like shit cuz why would I leave after she stayed with me thru my one year cancer journey. Any ideas or thoughts. I know she loves me but her love isn’t enough to make me feel satisfied. I’m very conflicted right now.\n",

She supported him through a tough year of cancer and chemo, but emotionally distanced herself during that time, making him feel unloved and lonely. Now that he’s recovering and doing better, he feels they’ve grown apart—she doesn’t show love the way he needs, doesn’t share in things he enjoys, and he feels more alone in the relationship. He’s conflicted because she was there during his hardest time, but her love no longer feels fulfilling or compatible. He’s considering leaving but feels guilty.\n",

      "Body text: This sounds supperr weird and I know I’m not overreacting. But lately I was feeling like things were going good and we’ve been having a good few weeks. Then I started to have dreams that he may be talking to a girl and whenever I’ll tell him he’ll just say that I’m just overthinking about our relationship and he’ll never do that to me, obviously I believe him because I know I tend to overthink A LOT(this dream happened a month ago). Then things started to get weird when me and him experienced a pregnancy scare which then led to a chemical pregnancy. I was telling him he’s distancing and I need him because Ik me and him have different ways of communicating and expressing ourselves. He then told me he’s gonna do his best for my needs and was being expressive ever since. Then I started getting this feeling that I should check his phone at least once to make myself feel better because he gave me the password before and I just felt like I never had to do anything like that before. So when he came over and we were just hanging out in my room time goes by and he’s about to leave and I ask him can I through his phone. When I go through his phone I see a girl so I obviously I open up the messages and then I see a sexual post sent to her I then asked who is she and his whole body language changed and asked me to give him his phone back and I told him no and kept scrolling and saw flirting messages between the two. It made me sick to my stomach to see it. This was a day after I told him about the cheating dream which hurt me even more they hadn’t texted recently when I saw the messages but it still hurt me we’ve been together since January and I just feel hurt by it. We talked about everything and what led up to it he never blamed me only himself and said he wants to do things right and attempt to be forward. It felt pathetic I was believing every word he said but I know that he meant it?\n",

When they had a break she was supposed to go to prom with him and she left him then telling him she found out she was pregnant by another dude. I felt sorry for him but I was still hurt and told him his past has nothing to do with me bc I too was in a toxic relationship but he doesn’t have to pay for that at all. He kept apologizing saying he can be better me being me I took him back because I care for him…he gave me his password to his phone and is being more in tune with us but idk how to feel.

      "Title: I (21F) get jealous of my partner (22M) having friends\n",
      "Body text: I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for nearly four years and our relationship is great. Apart from my jealousy issues. We went to school together so I know his friends and he also knows mine, so it’s not even an issue where I feel they could be bad people and not good influences. But I HATE whenever my boyfriend hangs out or wants to make plans with them. I am just seeking some advice on how to get over this jealousy, as I always try and feel that I’m fixing my brain until the next time he says he’s going to the pub and I get so jealous and sad that he’s spending time with his best friends. If I didn’t have friends it may be slightly  more understandable but I have the same number if not a few more friends who I love and always hang out with too, but I just get so sad when he does. I know it’s my brain thinking that as soon as he spends time with other people he loves and they make him happy he’ll no longer want to be with me and think I’m boring/not worth having in his life. He tells me that I need to try and see it just like my own friends, that it’s separate and me loving my friends doesn’t take away from any of my love for him, but it’s hard to do. As soon as we start talking about summer and he says he’d like to go on a few weekend holidays with his friends I get so upset about the fact he wants to hang out with them, part of me wants to be the only thing in his life that makes him happy, but the other part knows it’s such a good thing he has other people to love as well as me and we are both whole without each other. Please looking for some advice on how to stop this way of thinking and accept that the person I love also has love for other people and the fact he wants to spend time with them and they make him happy and laugh and get excited doesn’t affect our relationship? Thanks :)\n",

      "Body text: I apologize in advance if this post gets a little messy, but I would really appreciate some outside opinions on my situation. I will try to provide all the relevant details so you can form a clear understanding of what's been going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner \\[27M\\] and I \\[27F\\] have been together for almost three years. Overall, our relationship has been great, and he’s everything I’ve wanted in a partner. However, we’ve had quite a few arguments about his family, which I’ll explain below.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:**  \n",
      "We are both Asian, and my boyfriend migrated to the country we live in after finishing his studies here. His immediate family is back in his home country. I have a stable job and have tattoo sleeves on my arms, whereas my boyfriend doesn’t have any tattoos and likely never will, though he’s never judged me for mine. I come from a broken family, with divorced parents and a mother who has a criminal background. I did not went to university but hold a decent paying job. I no longer have a relationship with either parent but was raised by my uncle and aunt, with whom I am close with. In contrast, my boyfriend's parents are still together, but his father is currently serving a sentence for a financial crime. My boyfriend and his younger sister \\[28F\\] provide partial financial support to their mother and youngest sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Situations with His Family:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Initial Judgment:** Before I even met his family, his mother judged me based on my appearance from my social media account, particularly my tattoos, and made some hurtful comments. While I was hurt, I tried to comfort myself by thinking that she would view me differently once she got to know me. My boyfriend also stood up for me, calling her out for judging me without having met me first.\n",
      "* **Spending Time Together:** After some time, his mother and youngest sister visited us in our country. I made a real effort to bond with them, and our time together went well. However, after their visit, my boyfriend received phone calls from his mother, questioning if I was really who he wanted, making comments about my height and weight (I’m 153cm and weigh about 43kg), and criticizing my family background. I struggled to understand how she could judge me for things I had no control over, especially given that her family was also dealing with their own struggles due to her husband’s situation. They were blindsided when my partner's father was caught as he had been lying to them all these while. \n",
      "* **Questions About Money:** When his youngest sister first met me, she directly asked about my salary. On another occasion, she told me that their mother wanted my partner to find a rich girlfriend.\n",
      "* **Behavioral Issues with His Sister:** His youngest sister has behavioral issues and has been rude to me on several occasions. Just to quote a few examples, she called me “stupid” during a game and commented on my clothes by saying, “You’re wearing that?” To be fair, she behaves this way with everyone, not just me. However, I’ve had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about his sister’s behavior because I genuinely care about her and want to see her improve. After those talks, my boyfriend became stricter with her, making her more aware of her actions.\n",
      "* **Religious Views on Travel:** His mother has opposed us traveling together due to “religious reasons.” However, when we took her and his youngest sister on an all-expenses-paid trip, she had no problem with my partner and me sharing a room.\n",
      "* **Accommodation Issues in His Home Country:** When we visited my boyfriend’s home country, his mother expected me to stay in the hotel alone as she didn't want us to be sleeping in the same room as people would talk, despite the fact that it’s unsafe for women to be alone in his home country. Interestingly, his mother had previously stated that she would prefer her daughter’s partner to personally accompany her daughter home. This hurts me as it feels like a double standard and that the same consideration isn't shown to me as my partner's girlfriend. My partner did rejected what she said and stayed with me in the hotel throughout our visit back in his home country.\n",
      "* **Financial Concerns:** My boyfriend supports his mother and younger sister financially, which I’m fine with, as I am financially independent. However, there have been a few things that have bothered me. For instance, his mother feels it’s okay to buy a $200 handbag without any concern but then asks my boyfriend to reimburse her for a $35 toll when they drove us around during our visit back home. When she visits us, my partner and his younger sister cover all her expenses, including food and shopping. She then spends money on things I consider unnecessary, like a $40 lip tint for his youngest sister. His mom even spent $20k (which she claims is her own savings, so it’s justified) to bribe lawyers to help her husband in prison. Despite this, she criticized my boyfriend for not visiting her during Chinese New Year, accusing him of not stepping up as the “man of the family.” She also made comments about our spending, despite the fact that we had just taken her and his sister on an overseas trip, splitting the $10k cost ($5k each) between my partner and me, which she didn’t seem to mind when it was spent on her. We’ve also made the effort to bring them to the country we live in several times and went back to his home country to celebrate his youngest sister’s birthday. She even attacked me personally, saying that she thinks I control my partner and that I’m only so open to traveling alone with him because I don’t have parents who would care about me.\n",
      "* **Family Judgment:** His mother has not been overtly rude to me in person, and despite everything that’s happened, I’ve always tried to show her respect and care. However, I feel like my efforts are not being reciprocated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our arguments often stem from my frustration with how his mother judges me and how no one in his family seems to hold her accountable for her behavior. While my boyfriend defends me, he tries not to say anything too hurtful to his mom. On the other hand, I’ve always been someone who has no issue calling out my family if they’ve crossed a line. This difference in approach has caused tension, and it makes me feel like he’s protecting his mom's feelings while she doesn't consider mine. I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on how we can handle this situation. It’s tough because I understand my boyfriend feels stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I don’t want him to feel like he has to choose between me and his family. But at the same time, I don’t feel like my efforts and boundaries are being respected. I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this situation with him and his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost three years. His family, especially his mother and younger sister, have made hurtful comments about me regarding my appearance, family background, and financial status. Despite my efforts to build a good relationship with them, I feel like their judgment of me is constant, and my boyfriend seems stuck between protecting his family and supporting me. I’m frustrated because I feel like I’m not being treated with respect, and I’m seeking advice on how to handle these tensions and communicate with my boyfriend about it.\n",

      "Title: How do I have a better sex life in a long term relationship?\n",
      "Body text: I am in a lesbian relationship, Im 19 and she is 21. We had lots of sex in the beginning, and it was good sex. We were long distance so that also gave us time to miss eachother sexually and when we would visit eachother for a few days or a few weeks we would have sex almost every day and for hours. Its also my first longterm and lesbian relationship. She was the first person to ever make me orgasm, and our sex life was the best id ever had before. I have a high sex drive and im a very affectionate person. I feel most loved through phsyical touch and intimacy.  Ive done research about it and its the same for quite alot of people at the start of a relationship, its called spontaneous desire. Everything was new and exciting and we werent stuck in a routine with eachother or used to eachother, so the sex life was great and it was regular. We  both initiated equally and there werent too many concerns. Some things happened at about 4 months into dating, my partner experienced trauma with people in her life and she went through alot and moved away from those people to my state to live with me. As soon as she moved in with me, our intimacy and sex life declined almost instantly. This was because she was dealing with alot mentally, she left her whole life behind, her family and friends and was not very mentally stable. This of course caused her to not have anything to give to the relationship and I felt heartbroken because everything stopped, our hugs, kisses, dates, closeness, sex, everything. The intimacy with hugs and kisses has come back as time went on and I gave her patience, she tried really hard to show me love better because she could see how much it was destroying me. We would fight almost every day, it wasnt a happy time. Things have gotten better, we still fight sometimes but usually over small things that kind of blow up really quickly and then we resolve it and things are find. She is a good girlfriend and she does alot for me. The only thing that has been an ongoing issue is the sex. I think about it all the time and its really messing with my head. We have now been together about 8 months and our sex life is still not where i want it to be. She hardly initiates, shes been been training for 9 weeks at a new job which has \"sucked the life out of me\" as she says. I want to be desired, I want to feel wanted like I did in the beginning. I have stopped bringing up my issues with how much sex were not having and tried to stop pressuring her as she told me that would help it go back to normal, but I go weeks without mentioning a thing about sex, not showing the sexual side of me and I refuse to show it or it might pressure them and delay even more time until she wants to have sex with me again. I never initiate anymore and if i do initiate I get major anxiety and overthink before and during the sex and dont let myself enjoy it. Im usually overthinking too much that she doesnt want it, or if shes enjoying it, or if she actuallly wants me or just feels too bad with saying no to me and making me feel rejected.  My head is filled with thoughts about sex, not just me being horny but me being so terrified of things gettings worse as our relationship continues. I am even getting terrified of having kids because if this is my sex life when im this young, weve only been together 8 months and its only about once a week we have sex (which is not enough for me personally but everyone is different). I am panicking. I have done research on desire and how to keep your sex life alive. Doing things like still going on dates and still triggering eachothers desire with long passionate kisses, flirting, etc. I have realised its normal to not feel horny all the time or in the mood out of the blue like at the beginning of the relationship, you have to prioritise it and make the effort. I am devastated knowing my girlfriend has never had as big a sex drive as me from the beginning and that ill never experience things like spontaneous sex in the morning or being woken up in the middle of the night, or during the day on a random Saturday. Life is getting busy which is normal but im struggling with this part of me that craves closeness and connection through sex. Im so stuck on what to do and I am even questioning if id be better off finding someone more compatible with me sexually, i just want to have a good sex life especially when im this young and not have to constantly worry about it I just want it to be easy and flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love my girlfriend, I love the life we have together in our little home and with our cats, I love them so much and I continue to love them every day. But this one part of our relationship is destroying me, its building anger and resentment. I am constantly trying to find a solution. Im angry that this is our sex life and its just me always waiting to be wanted and desired, its no way to live and I need help asap. How do you maintain a good sex life in a longterm relationship? How do you keep the sexual desire alive where intimacy is consistent?\n",

      "Body text: Background: I (27F) have been in a relationship with my partner (29M) since August 2024. It definitely started out as a rebound for me, as I’d just gotten out of a year long relationship. From August 2024 to about December 2024, we were just exclusively hooking up. It was only since the start of 2025 that things got quite romantic and we are now definitely together and enjoying being together. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far, it has been really great. He’s a bit more introverted, so we spend lots of time at his place, cooking, chatting and watching our shows. He takes me out on really cute thoughtful dates too. We feel very comfortable in each other’s presence. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 3 months, I have been unemployed. I have spent a lot of time applying (unsuccessfully!) and this has taken a huge knock on my self-esteem. My partner has been incredibly supportive throughout. I’ve been in a bit of a depressive slump and this has affected most parts of my life (not sleeping / eating well, lack of exercise etc)- most relevant to this sub, is that it has impacted my relationship. I’m not as engaged, energetic, and upbeat as I once was. Our sex life has significantly slowed down too. My partner has never once been unkind about this, but I know that my mood shift has affected him. \n",
      "\n",
      "My job prospects are not looking great (I’m currently working part time for family so I still have some money but it’s not ideal). I really need some advice on how to improve my mood and get myself back on track, for myself, and also to be a better partner. Please comment if you can relate or if you have some advice :)\n",

      "Title: I (27f) am feeling overwhelming anxiety after getting back together with my boyfriend (28m)\n",
      "Body text: So me and my bf have been having problems for some time now, the last few months have specifically been really bad. Fighting constantly, needing space from each other only to come back and fight again, etc. We talked about doing couples therapy but then life happened and my insurance was weird, so that took the backseat for a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 weeks ago I hit my breaking point, and I broke up with him with little explanation after a fight. I immediately regretted it and came back 15 minutes later crying, asking for him to forgive me. He understandably needed space, and we talked a few days later. During that conversation, he said he needed a break/a breakup. We talked for a while, and I said I really didn't want to but I understood where he was coming from and call me in the fall if he changes his mind (Whatever, not the best choice, I know).\n",
      "\n",
      "For about 5 days, we're broken up. And honestly? I felt kinda good. Not anxious, not constantly worried about this other person, fighting with someone else all the time, it was kind of nice. However, then he texts me, asking me to talk. Saying this has been the worst week of his life, he's sorry, he was speaking out of anger and selfishness.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked and he said he agreed the relationship wasn't working, we both are so sick of fighting constantly and being constantly miserable, but we both felt like (at different times this week) we really wanted to try and work it out and do everything we could. So, he proposed going to couples therapy and making a commitment for 6 months that we would work really hard and try really hard to make it work, and if after 6 months nothing was improving, we could part knowing we did all we could.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan seemed like a great idea. He offered me space and time to think about it, but I just said yes, probably impulsively. In the days since then, we've had a really good time hanging out and we had a consultation with a therapist that we're going to start working with who seems to understand the situation adn think we can work it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can't shake this feeling that I made a mistake and I regret getting back together. Ever since we got back together I've been incredibly anxious about jumping back into something that doesn't work--about being miserable for another 6 months of my life and having to pretend things are ok, about having to tell my friends and family who saw how much this relationship was draining me that I'm actually jumping back in and trying again. My gut is telling me that this maybe isn't a great idea and the uncertainty is killing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if the uncertainty is the thing killing me, it seems like at least giving it a go to try and fix it and having my relationship status be stable for at least a little bit might be a good idea. And clearly he's trying and committed to trying to make this better.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back together, I made a promise that I would uphold my end of the commitment, and I know that going back on that would be extremely hurtful and something that we could never come back from. THerefore, part of me wonders if it's worth it to just try therapy and see if we can make it work. However, I can't help but feel in my gut that my heart is not in it and every day that I get further into this the more overwhelmed and trapped I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure if the best move is to try to talk to him about all of this or just suck it up or just break it off. We love each other a lot, and I don't want to hurt him, but I don't want to lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; After a period of turbulence, me and my boyfriend decided our relationship wasn't working and he broke up with me. He then reached out to me expressing how committed he was to working on our relationship, and I also felt that way so we got back together, but now I'm having doubts.\n",

      "Title: 24M Dealing with 22F GF’s Family and Moving\n",
      "Body text: I am 24M.  My girlfriend is 22F.  We have been “officially” dating 2 years this month (although we were dating as soon as we met each other, just never said it, but we knew).\n",
      "\n",
      "I currently live at home with my parents, and I’m saving money to move out.  She lives between her parent’s house and an apartment with her brother which are both 15/20 minutes from where I live.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We have been dating for almost 2 years now and I have had completely minimal contact with her parents/family in general.  Part of that is my fault for not introducing myself the first night I took her out on a date and ever since.  At the same time, they have not really gone out of their way to see me either, and my gf has not really pushed for me to meet them.  So many months go by, we’re still dating, and the most I’ve ever done is say “hi” and shake hands in their driveway when I would come to pick her up.  So they really don’t know me at all.  \n",
      "Meanwhile, my gf has told me all about them throughout the months.  Not gonna pull any punches here…her family is dysfunctional.  She tells me all about how her Mom is a complete narcissist.  Her Dad is more reasonable, but he’s sexually attracted to my gf (his own blood daughter btw).  They abuse my gf by always belitting her, making her do chores, giving her more responsibility than any of her older siblings, making her pay rent/bills while others don’t (the parents don’t need the money whatsoever), always expecting more of her, not respecting her privacy, sometimes physical violence, silent treatment from the Mom, etc. etc.  She is basically the Cinderalla of the house.  So all the while I hear about how bad her family is.  I don’t want to meet them at all the more I learn about them.  They sound crazy from the outside looking in.  But my gf is infinitely sweet, and it really makes no sense how she is the way she is, given that environment.  I love her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, one day, over a year into our relationship, we set up a night for me to come over for dinner to really meet her parents and brother/sister.  I am dreading it.  The night before I drank with some of my friends (probably subconsciously sabotaging myself on purpose).  I was extremely hungover all the next day.  I told my gf to tell her family I was very sorry, I don’t want to be sitting down for dinner giving them a real first impression while I’m miserably hungover, and if we could do this dinner on any other night that I would be more than willing to.  I was very apologetic, I genuinely felt bad, and I knew it was a stupid mistake.  I had embarassed my gf because she thought that I was gonna come and they would finally be able to meet me, and I was basically cancelling the day of, after it’d been planned a few days prior.  I felt like a total idiot.  \n",
      "So the whole night at dinner, her family is shit talking me, joking her, talking complete crap about me and her, etc etc and she just has to listen to it, alone.  She was, understandably, extremely disappointed.  She then tells me that her family is no longer interested in inviting me over anymore, I’m no longer welcome, and I will not be receiving any more invites to dinner.  I guess no second chances, right ?  I know I’d made a mistake, but to admit it, apologize, and then not be given even a chance seems unreasonable.  Her family, I’ve learned, is not reasonable.\n",
      "Time goes by.  We’re still dating.  Ever since I missed that dinner, I’ve had no in-person interactions with her family besides occassionally seeing her brother in their apartment.  As time goes by, her family begins building a resentment/grudge towards me for no real reason.  They think she should break up with me.  My gf had been going through some clinical mental issues at the time that were inherited and completely unrelated to me.  They blamed it on me.  They thought I was causing her mental anguish, they thought I was the reason she was getting depressed, etc etc.  Relationship-wise the two of us were doing fine, though.  We had hiccups here and there like any couple would, but I knew and she knew that I was not causing the problems she was suffering from mentally.  It required medication.  \n",
      "Their perception of me had gotten so bad, that they told her we had to break up.  We love each other, and she did not want to do that.  So she basically told them that we did break up, and we’ve been seeing each other in secret for the past couple months or so.  \n",
      "But before it got that bad, she’s told me they wouldn’t even open the door for me to talk to them in person.  I told her she has to try to convince them to at least have a dialogue with me about dating their daughter.  She tells me every time she brings it up they don’t want to hear it.  They get angry, they yell at her, they tell her to drop the subject.  They literally will not speak with me about it, and they will not listen to her, no matter what she says.  It got so bad to the point where they told her that if she continues to date me, she will be cutoff from the family.  They’ll take away any payments they help her with.  They’ll take her out of the inheritence, no holidays, no contact.  Just out of their lives.  Which is a totally reasonable thing to tell your daughter that you “love,” right ?\n",
      "So she is faced with the dilemma of basically choosing between me or her family.  She loves her family unconditionally (for better or worse), and she loves me the same way.  So in the meantime, we have been dating in secret while we try to figure a solution.\n",
      "I asked my parents.  They told me that it’s an all around bad situation.  They love my gf and think she’s great, but that her family is not great.  That I would be putting myself in for a world of hurt by continuing down a path with her and trying to ever get in the good graces of her crazy family.  To some extent, I agree, but I love her and I feel like I should be able to have a life with her and just have her family be separate and only have contact when needed.  The thing is, I’m really not a bad guy, and I think they would learn to not hate me if they actually knew who I was, but they don’t care to learn.  I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now her family wants her to move to a different state,  get a new job or two, and pay rent in a condo they have paid off while she also goes to a new school.  (She has already graduated college, so I’m not exactly sure why they want her to do more school.)  She is planned to make this move in mid June.  It is May 12th, 2025 as of this writing.  So we probably have about a month.  She wants me to move to this new state with her, and live in her condo with her in secret.  Meanwhile, if her family ever came to visit, I’d have to hide all of my belongings and stay somewhere else while they’re there.  Which I think is completely unreasonable, and I have no ties to anyone in the new state we’d be in.  I’d also have to acquire a new job, and we’d both be living on our own for the first time, in secret.  Like I couldn’t even be in the background while she’s on the phone with them.\n",
      "So she wants me to move with her.  I’m telling her it’s a bad deal for me.  Her parents would inevitably find out and probably make her end it with me anyways.  I don’t think long distance ever works.  And I don’t know how to start any meaningful dialogue with her parents to prevent any of this, or get their blessing to stay with her.\n",
      "TL;DR So in conclusion…my gf’s family hates me, she is moving out of state and wants me to move with her and live in secret from her parents while upending my current job/life where I live now.  \n",
      "I am looking for any reasonable solutions or any advice whatsoever in such a complicated situation.\n",
      "It would be horrible to end our relationship just because of some outside factors that have nothing to do with how we feel about each other.\n",

      "Title: I Think My Gf’s Best Childhood Friend Loves Her\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "My gf, Mary (30F) and I (27F) have been dating for about 10 months. It’s been incredible in every way and I finally feel I’ve found my person. We’ve traveled abroad together already, spent the holidays together, and have met each others families. We plan to move in together around the 1 1/2 year mark. We have had only one fight and typically have amazing communication if something needs to be expressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one fight we have had is a current continued one , revolving around her childhood best friend, Rich (30M). Rich is a pretty socially awkward guy but overall still a nice person from most of the interactions I’ve had with him. They’ve been friends since middle school and have been through a lot of trauma together. Long before we met, Mary and Rich would hang out 2-3 time a a week. Then about a year before we met, Mary got upset at him because he was being a bad friend and they were seeing each other significantly less. She even prefers to see him with me there as a buffer. Now, Mary, Rich and I usually hang out all together.  There have been a few moments where I feel Rich is in Love with Mary. I think that from the below moments and my intuition on having experienced a good guy friend liking me in the past, when I didn’t realize. \n",
      "\n",
      "- on her 30th surprise birthday he brought her a huge bouquet of flowers. When I was setting up and he gave them to me he mentioned “he felt bad because it should be the partner to bring the flowers, but they were so beautiful so he couldn’t help himself” I thought It was a weird comment and put them with the rest of the gifts. \n",
      "- whenever we hang out as us three he will hang onto her every word. If she bends over or walks away his eyes usually follow her and I’ve caught Rich checking her out. \n",
      "- Always makes comments about how when Mary, Mary’s teenage nephew, and Rich used to go out. They get mistaken for a family and her nephew is their son. \n",
      "- he texts me looking to buy expensive gifts for Mary, but then tells us in person that he can’t afford expensive gifts for his Girlfriend and that they are having problems. \n",
      "-Rich confessed he liked Mary long ago in college (unsure on the full timing) she turned him down and they moved on as she continued to come out and date more women. She still likes both men and women. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I tried to bring this all up and frame it that I am feeling uncomfortable because of points a,b and c. Mary got so defensive saying that I need to trust her and she would know or realize if Rich had feelings for her all these years. I was dead wrong in my perspective. She seemingly invalidated my experiences and perspective. I tried to drop it over the course of a few weeks until we hung out again recently. \n",
      "\n",
      "This last time it was evident to me that Rich was checking out my girlfriend and it upset me. He continued to check her out when she turned around and kept begging her to come over to help him with something. Once he left I brought it up again that I was not comfortable. She was extremely defensive and upset with me again. She claims I continue to “not trust her perspective and judgement” and I’m being “crazy to think he would ever like her”. Mary always believes Rich is an awkward nice guy and that’s why I feel weird about him. She also mentioned she put a boundary up to only see him once a month to make me feel more Comfortable since the last time we spoke. However she never voiced this to me until in this fight so I have no idea how the boundary was put in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mary continues to say that I am being controlling about this situation and it isn’t sitting well with her. I should add she has other straight guy friends, queer friends, and other lesbians around that I’ve met and she hangs out with alone. I encourage her to go out with her friends alone. I have no problem with this and we have no fights about it. I only have voiced how I feel discomfort around rich and think he has romantic feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I don’t even want to ever be around Rich again as it causes so much tension every time. I know I can’t say that as that is controlling to ask someone to cut a friend of 20 years off or say I’ll never be around him again. I’m missing a lot of background of their friendship and I get that. \n",
      "\n",
      "To meet in the middle I mentioned having him over every other month when we live together or hanging out as two couples. She did not like the timing idea as she felt her boundary she put in place was enough. Mary didn’t want to see him less as he is depressed and “going through it”, and I was being controlling. Mary says she also reached out to Rich to double date, but his gf is always busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure what to do at this point without her getting so defensive or another huge fight coming up. Im tired. Am I missing something in this situation? Do you think that I am being controlling of the friendship to ask to see him even less than the boundary she already put in place in our home? I don’t want to feel uncomfortable in our shared home and what is supposed to be our safe space. (Hanging out outside is not really an option as Rich is always going through it and can’t be outside at a park or can’t afford to go grab dinner) What would you do to come to a solution with your partner so you both feel good about this? Will it just sort itself out because he’s also a bad friend?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; My girlfriend strongly feels her good childhood friend does not have feelings for her. I feel he has strong romantic feelings and it makes me uncomfortable to have him around. How do we move forward that’s best for the both of us without the continued fight?\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been in a relationship f(21) with my boyfriend m(22) for over two years now. Our relationship is a bit sticky because of his parents (a long history of them being mean and refusing to get to know me but deciding to dislike me). We have had countless arguments about it mostly me being insecure and upset but he always did take my side it just yk it’s my fair. Afar from that, I only try to focus on us two. But I just feel like I haven’t been feeling much love from him. Our love languages are pretty different. Mine is words of affirmation and quality time whereas his is mostly gifts. I feel loved through talking or written out words, and quality time. We always had a small distance between us making phone calls and video chats the easiest way to see each other. But during those calls, he’s always ALWAYS too busy doing something else. Whether it’s gaming, phone games, or even j on Reddit, he can’t just give me at least five minutes of listening or looking at each other and being attentive. I fully understand that he wants to do other things while on call, and I’m not trying to make him not do that either. I’m just at least wanting a short time of at least eye contact and engaging in our conversations bc for me when he wants to call, I don’t do anything else to give him the full attention, yet he ends up missing what I say the entire time. Idk if I’m being the crazy one but I just want to feel reciprocated with the amount of love I give to him. And when I try to communicate that to him, he just gets so defensive or upset then becomes avoidant. I don’t focus on buying expensive gifts like he does but I do it through words. I’ve been sending him emails with love letters in them for over two years now, wishing he’d write me one. Idk. I honestly feel like 2 years is still an early stage of a relationship where showing affection is necessary, but to him he just brushes it off saying he’s to lazy or we’ve been together long enough. So I only get the full affection in the first year but that’s it?\n",

      "Title: My (24F) dad (53M) blocked me on Facebook and Instagram. Is it worth it to confront him about it?\n",
      "Body text: Long story short, my dad and I reconnected in 2023 after 10 years of no contact. We have a very complicated relationship and it is, unfortunately, mainly one-sided. I am mainly the one who asks to come over to his house, plan dinners, ask how he is doing, while he only sends me texts on special occasions and asks if I need money. He lives with his wife and my little step-brother. He puts all of his energy and focus into my little brother and is committed to training him in wrestling. This dynamic has left me feeling very disconnected from their family and like an outsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never asked them for any help until recently. A few weeks ago I was nearing homelessness and asked if I could stay at their house just for a couple months until I start a new lease in the summer. They reassured me that it was fine and that I could stay as long as I wanted so I moved in over the weekend. A day after I moved in, my dad texted me saying there was an issue with their housing agreement and that having an extra person living in their home would be in violation of their agreement. He then told me that I had to pick up all my stuff the next day, didn't ask where I would be living next, and said if I needed money I could text him. I declined his offer for money and figured out my living situation on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just last week and I haven't heard anything from them since I left. I decided to check my dad's Facebook because I look through it occasionally and found out he blocked me as well as on Instagram. I am very confused because I did nothing for the day that I was at his place besides move my stuff and go to sleep. Maybe he feels guilty about his decision or has decided he wants nothing to do with me anymore? However, he hasn't blocked my phone number. I am thinking of texting him and asking why he blocked me but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I was also maybe thinking of texting his wife instead since she is a lot more parental than he is and feel like she would be more inclined to tell me what happened. I'm not sure what the right decision is. I did look forward to at least having a relationship with my little brother but I don't know how to navigate that if my dad wants to possibly cut contact. Any advice would be appreciated and I am open to answer any questions!\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - My dad blocked me on social media shortly after I moved out of his house. I don't know if I should confront him or not. I am confused if this is a sign that he feels guilty or that he does not want me part of his life anymore. He has not blocked my number so I can still text him.\n",

When we first got together, things were really good and we had sex a lot. Naturally, our sex life had taken a back seat due to working, moving, and just being busy. My anxiety had flared up big time, and now I’m in my head a lot about this. \n",

      "This will get TMI fast, I apologize.\n",

      "In the beginning, I made it clear I don’t feel comfortable when we have sex and it’s just me receiving anything. Due to past trauma, it makes me feel absolutely terrible when I’m the only one receiving physical acts. She knows this and I’ve worked on this a lot, so we can on occasion have this kind of sex. She can be a stone top sometimes, and isn’t in the mood to be touched all the time (valid) so we don’t have this type of sex unless we are both comfortable. \n",

It makes me feel like she’s only doing it since I asked and I feel guilty. But she’s made it so clear that is untrue, and she really enjoys sex with me no matter what, and she would say no if she didn’t want it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the actual problem…. She’s the best, most patient person with me and my anxiety, I love her so much but I’m so frustrated with her right now. She has brought up maybe exploring kinks to see if we can get over my anxiety and bring me out of my head. I love the idea and asked her what she would like to try but she’s leaving it up to me. She has her hard no’s, but is making me choose something to start with. I am so far removed from the kink world that I don’t know what I would like and not like. She has experience as a bdsm dom, so I was hoping she would give me some directions. \n",

      "The problem is, I can’t get over the thought that whatever I choose and ask for, she won’t be into and then I’m not interested in it. She isn’t necessarily into anything, but says she will work with whatever I wanna try. But I’m only wanting to try what she wants. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like we’re going around in circles and it’s making me upset and frustrated. She won’t even give me a list of stuff she would even be slightly into. And then her saying she’s not interested in anything, makes me not want to do anything since I’ll feel guilty. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know I’m an anxious person, I’ve been to therapy for it and I’m working on it all the time, but I’ve never had it affect me like this with such an intimate situation. Should I just suck it up, and stop being a baby about this? \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been in a **very** happy, emotionally affirming relationship for almost a year. He's been incredibly caring, good at verbalizing affection, giving me gifts, and just in general has been a good, attentive boyfriend that is willing to talk things through.   \n",

      "\n",
      "I realized he’s great at expressing all his *positive* emotions, but when it comes to confrontation or processing *negative* stuff, he just shuts down. The actual argument started because he said a “joke” over text that really crossed a line. I told him how it hurt me, and while he *did* apologize, his responses gave off “let’s just move on” energy. He was also taking 30 mins to an hour to respond while I was trying to actually talk it through.\n",
      "\n",
      "This avoidant behavior kept up until we finally called the next day. He was really defensive at first, until he admitted that he’s just “not good at articulating himself” and his first instinct was to not think about things at all. I had a long convo with him about how we can’t just push emotionally heavy stuff aside. I also told him that sometimes it feels like he treats me like a “guy friend” as we both have more traditionally masculine hobbies and that he needs to start recognizing the difference between me being his best friend and me being his *partner* when we’re having disagreements.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "After we gave each other some room and called again I ended up fully forgiving him as I did see a change in his behavior where he was more considerate/gentle towards me + seemed truly apologetic. Later into the night we talked about our home lives for a while as we have similar experiences. Throughout the conversation he said things like \"he's just learned to not linger too much on it\" and how this carries over to other parts of his life. ie. how he doesn't really tell his friends really anything about things that bother him (unrelated to his home life).   \n",
      "  \n",
      "We had this moment where I said something like, “I’ve been in therapy for 3 years, and I’ve genuinely learned to love myself.” And he responded with “I don’t really like myself.” I asked him if he wanted to explain why, and he just said “not really.”\n",

      "Title: My roommates (20F and 22F) are horrible and I am about to move out\n",
      "Body text: Hello, the past year I lived with four other girls, two of which I love, the other two, who are sisters, are simply awful. The younger one is extremely confrontational, petty, selfish, and acts like she is the only person in the house. She will leave molding dishes for weeks and weeks, take up the fridge space with massive Tupperware that gets moldy, throw other people’s things out, eat other people’s food, broke the blinds and refused to replace them, and does not take accountability for anything. The older one supports her sister and acts like everyone else is the issue when it comes to dishes, messes, replacing damages, etc. She also has let her bf live at our place and refuses to acknowledge that for months, while he uses utilities and is always in our spaces. They regularly talk shit about me, because I’m the new tenant (all I have done is ask nicely for clean dishes in a group chat without pointing fingers, and then also ask nicely that rent be paid on time, as $50 of late fees landed on me and she does not take accountability).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their force together, with their combined pettiness, lack of accountability, and inconsideration, has made living here hell. My other roommate, my friend, who had known them longer, got in a one-sided dispute with the younger one, which has caused my friend to want to move out. About an hour ago the older sister just yelled at my friend for MINUTES in front of everyone, calling her immature, and saying the dispute was her fault and they did her a favor “letting her live with them” and that she owes them that. It was really hard to listen to.\n",

      "Anyways, as my friend and I both plan to move out, I am wondering what I can do to get some sort of revenge as I leave. Is there anything subtle I can do to the place? Also the younger one drives and does not have a license so I’m wondering if there is anything that I can do about that as well. I have been nothing but nice, a people-pleaser, and so tolerant of this.\n",

      "Hi,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for two and a half years. Like any couple, we’ve had our ups and downs, but things have generally been good. Our relationship is somewhat long-distance due to cultural and traditional reasons—we live in different cities, though not far apart.\n",

      "\n",
      "Two months ago, her workplace hired a new head manager. As usual, she shared stories involving him, and from what I could gather, he seemed like a typical smooth-talker—overly nice in a way that didn’t feel genuine. Over time, their interactions became the centerpiece of her stories. Their jokes and conversations became more personal—not sexual, but intimate enough to make me uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",

      "About a week ago, she was fired from her job. She became withdrawn, stopped answering my calls, and only responded through text. I offered to visit her and take her out to help her feel better—not for my sake, but hers. She refused, saying she was too depressed.\n",

      "Body text: TLDR: I’ve (29F) been with my bf (29M) for over a decade. I think trauma is causing us to drift apart, and while I’ve tried to get him help, I think it’s causing me to resent him. I don’t think he’s can be the partner I need and it terrifies me.\n",

      "I’ve (29F) been dating my bf (29F) since high school. For years, our love was magical. Full of lust, passion, laughs, and great memories. Since we’ve known each other for years, we’ve experienced a lot together. That includes trauma. He lost a parent at a young age (15) and I always feared it would come back to haunt him later on. He tried therapy but never truly healed his wounds. He then went years without therapy. Fast forward to graduating college, I feel like I was living my best life and thriving with my career and experiencing new cities.. while he was just there and along for the ride. At times, I felt like he wasnt in reality. Idk if that makes sense. Like he almost refused to grow up internally. He has always treated me with respect and love but when it came to doing *adult things (like looking ahead to the future or financial planning or career planning or planning in general), he just couldn’t. For years this has been slowly drawing me away from him. But I still love him so much and care deeply for him and he does for me. He tells me that I’m his biggest motivator. And yes, I’ve always pushed him to be proactive and do the best he can do. Becuase in my eyes he has so much potential. I know what he is capable of because I knew him before the trauma, but part of me is thinking he may be stuck and may not be capable to get there and it scares me sm. \n",

      "Recently we  moved to a new city. It was a shaky time for us. I was excited but he was a little nervous and really wants to settle but unsure if this city is the right place for him. Something set in for him and myself though after we moved. I pretty much forced him to go to therapy and start feeling his emotions again. He did. He’s made improvements and it makes me so happy but it feels like it’s too late for me. I don’t want it to be. I’ve tried to get him to work on himself for years and he’s always pushed back and never wanted to face reality. Now that he’s finally doing it, it weirdly makes me feel soooo distant, disconnected, and almost resentful. It’s almost like I just wanted to make sure he got the help he needs so I can move on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I feel like all my family and friends are worried for me because our relationship has a slow burn now. I can see it in their eyes and wondering “what’s next?” Or “something needs to change”. So sometimes when we’re out, I get pretty annoyed by my BF. Pretty much everything he does. From eating, talking, and coughing. The resentment is in full force. \n",
      "\n",
      "  It’s so hard for me to write this becuase deep down I believe he’s my soul mate, but the cards he’s been dealt in life are pushing him away from me. Again, he’s working on himself but I’m at the age where I need to make a decision. It feels too late for me.  unfortunately it comes at the cost of losing my best friend and love of my life. The timing sucks. \n",

      "Body text: TLDR: I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years. I made mistakes early on, and even though we both grew, I’m still treated like I’m always the problem. We’ve lost emotional and physical intimacy, and I feel distant and unfulfilled. I miss my friends and wonder if I’m settling. Sometimes things feel good again, but it doesn’t last.

That really hurt. I confronted her, and although we talked it through, that was probably the moment I started feeling differently.

      "For one, physical affection is really important to me, and she’s not into it much. She doesn’t say a lot of loving things, and we haven’t been intimate in about 6 months not even making out.

      "Title: Please give me advice\n",
      "Body text: This is the situation I am in. These are the people involved. my partner (19M) and I (19F) have been dating for almost 2 years. through the 2 years we have obviously had our fights, our breaks, and struggles. \n",
      "Here is some context: \n",
      "My birthday is coming up in June, His birthday is a couple months after mine. Last year for my birthday we went on a quick family trip for 2 days for my birthday, he was included. He didn’t get me anything for my birthday, not even paying for my food when we went to the trip for my birthday. (not that it’s expected but it would have been nice) and i also gave him time to save up for my birthday just incase he did want to buy me something. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got him a Record player, and some vinyls, some new shoes and gadgets. My love language is gift giving, so I always buy him gifts just because. I have expressed my feelings to him about this, and have told him i’d even prefer a letter from him literally ANYTHING. He had given me some letters but only really when I keep bothering him to write me them. He buys me flowers, and pays for our food when we go out to eat but that’s it. I buy our concert tickets, I buy him anything he wants but he never does it in return. \n",
      "now it’s almost my birthday AGAIN. and i’ve told him to save up and that I wanted a KitchenAid mixer, or some new shoes, maybe a bracelet or necklace, maybe a promise ring. ( which we’ve talked about and he gives me false hope that he will buy me a promise ring but he never has.)  I’ve given him many options and he knows what i like.  \n",
      "I’m just waiting to see if he gets me anything on my birthday, or seeing if he makes up excuses saying why he doesn’t have enough money, or that he knows the item is not going to arrive on time, or simply that I don’t deserve the items for my birthday. He has said all these excuses to me in the past. \n",
      "long story short what do i even do, i love him dearly but it just feels like my wants and needs are being put to the side. I’m not a very materialistic person but It would be nice to receive a gift here and then or like i stated simply just a hand written letter would be nice. \n",
      "All of my friends are saying Im just settling for the bare minimum, but it’s a very hard situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still want to be with him , what should i do with him? talk it out more? TL;DR My situation is very tricky, but i still want to remain together. \n",

      "Title: Bf (M29) told me (F25) a year and a half in that he is not sure he is in love, hasn't felt the spark.\n",
      "Body text: My bf 29M has never been incredibly romantic with me 25F in our 1.5 relationship. When we first started dating he told me he was in such poor timing with work and being kicked out of his apartment and said he didn't like me THAT MUCH but he said we had known each other for two months and we needed to get to know each other more but that he knew for sure he wanted to be with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agreed since I also felt the same way, I liked him a lot but not crazy and blind, liked him to date and was excited about it. We started dating afterwards and my feelings def grew, I fell in love with him, I assumed he did too. But since he wasn't as romantic I eventually had the conversation and it fell into a: I am not romantic because I don't feel that, it doesn't come to me naturally because it's not in my heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said that he has never been this cold in a relationship and thinks it has to do with his master's degree, two jobs and terrible housing situation. He said that in other relationships he was way more romantic and drunkish in love. I was petrified. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if we was in love with me? And he said \"I can't say that. I've had my doubts about my feelings towards you, I love you and I like you a lot and I want to be with you, but I can't for certain say I'm in love with you\". He again, said that he's never been this stressed in his life and that I caught him at such at a bad time and that he believes this is why he hasn't felt it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He begged for me to wait together until his degree \n",
      "and his two jobs were gone so we could spend more time together and his mind could be more free but I couldn't bare the pain of knowing my boyfriend was not fully convinced about what he felt towards me, since it was already bringing me pain and insecurity. He claimed that the \"in love\" part wasn't needed since it was a chemical reaction and that he chose to be with me because he wanted me in his life and that was even more powerful and stronger but I called bs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked about previous relationships and he said that his \"in love\" levels have diminished as years go and that other dates before me didn't convince him but I made the cut, enough for him to try again. He then went to say that he wished and would want me badly to be the one but can't feel the spark that he's felt before. I def feel a spark for him and I've felt like I've been patient enough and I've convinced myself that his feelings will not spark the night he gets his diploma. \n",
      "\n",
      "We finished the conversation with me trying to lighten it for him saying that others will come and he said they will not be the same, not me. And I said well you might actually fall in love and said: don't know. I keep reading where love takes work and that sometimes all those chemicals indeed go away but I also know the importance of feeling loved that way and how fulfilling it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, I so desperately want him. I genuinely thought he was the one and it pains me to know he wants me to be the one but is unsure about his feelings. I'm trying to find what's best. How should we navigate this? \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: boyfriend said that he hasn't felt the spark or being in love with me and we have been dating for a year and a half. He claims it's stress, since he's never been this stressed in his life and wants to stay together to see if those develop once his life improves. He believes choosing to be with me is stronger than being in love with me while I think love means feelings and choice. How should we take this on? \n",

      "Body text: I m23 have been with my boyfriend m23 for about 8 months now. He’s just moved out of state in hopes to make more money so i can move with him and last weekend i had it all hit at once. The fear, the doubt and the pit in my stomach just came in and burrowed deep. Ive never had a doubt until that weekend which he was working long hours and i just hardly heard anything from him. \n",

      "I wanted to hear how is new job was going, how he’s liking it there and just anything but he was busy and tired. I crashed out after a couple days of sitting in my thoughts alone and i fear I’ve put us in a position where things are just awkward now. We’ve never had an issue where we couldn’t have a normal conversation about it but i was just angry and scared and couldn’t hold it in. Since then, I’ve checked everything every day every minute, location, following, when he’s out of the house i just can’t even sleep. \n",

      "The worry that now that he’s seen this side of me that he won’t anything to do with me and will just find someone new and exciting before i can even get up there. Ive been cheated on every relationship prior, and he knows this himself. I told him from the beginning i never want to be this overbearing boyfriend who distrusts everything and thinks he’s going to just get one over on me but i feel it creeping back in. I love this man, he has truly brought out so much life from me that i never knew that i had and i don’t want to ruin things for us just because I’ve been burned before. TLDR, how does anyone get over past instances with cheating and continue forward in a relationship healthily?\n",

      "Body text: TLDR: The title pretty much sums it up. 18 months in and I'm starting to feel more comfortable whereas she still desires a spark. She talks about it in a way that makes it seem like a dealbreaker, like it's something we just feel fundamentally different about, I'm trying to look for compromises.\n",

      "My and girlfriend have been in an online-relationship for 18 months. Recently, a little mishap happened that got us to discuss the aforementioned question. A quick recap of the events:\n",
      "\n",
      "She was doing her makeup on videocall. As I am but a simple man I asked some questions about what she's doing and what all the makeup is for, however what I never mentioned was any type of compliment on her looks. Then she asked me \"are you going to complement me?\", to which I just laughed as I thought she was being silly, but she was actually genuinely upset that I didn't compliment her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wasn't just a one time thing, this conversation has been brought up multiple times about our seemingly never aligned expectations from one another specifically when it comes to compliments or verbal affection. I do give her compliments and have been improving with that as well, she would also acknowledge that, yet it still seems that either I am lacking or that she is expecting too much when it comes to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing she brought up that I thought was interesting is that she had a 4 year relationship that lasted from when she was 18-22 where this 'spark' she had never seemed to dissipate throughout the entire relationship. They were as lovey-dovey when they started as when things took an unfortunate turn causing them to break up. It's making me think that perhaps we are just fundamentally different in what we expect, but at the same time I can't help but feel she's seeing things through rose-tinted glasses. Perhaps the spark in her previous relationship stayed because of how young she was? I don't know. I'm not a professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to come into this as open-minded as possible. She just thinks that 'that's how she is and that's how I am', like two paths that will never cross, I'm willing to believe that there is some way to find a compromise or solution of sorts. I hope it goes without saying that I still love her and think she's amazing, but I do guess that I'm also just starting to feel comfortable enough to be a little more casual around her.\n",

      "Title: Desperation\n",
      "Body text: I [18M] have been almost a month with my partner [18F]. Before we started officially dating, we've been already acting like in a relationship. Everything's going fine between us, and the only two obstacles so far have been \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Her parents, which put her in misogynistic situations on what she should do or what not (even though they do not actually control her). This makes her feel ashamed sometimes for things she shouldn't and also prevent her from meeting me, she feels awful sometimes because the sitution her parents put her into. But I'm not focusing on that rn. Also, our sexual life is going great for both of us whether her parents complain or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. My past trauma. Feelings of guilt, fear of abandonment, derrealization, depression... I've been working for years on all this stuff, and I work all of this on my own. I'm not trying to build emotional dependency on her, and she's really aware of my situations too. So it's just that I'm struggling to get out of trauma and finally writing a positive narrative for my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before her, I only had one boyfriend. He left me as soon as depression (which appeared to prevent me from feeling loved or happy, as a coping mechanism) came back, he didn't want to be around someone like me I guess. Then after that, I was in love with another girl for a long time and everything was awful. She ghosted me constantly, but then on parties we were really affectionate. But it wasn't a good thing, because then we wouldn't see each other for some time and wouldn't even write me. She was basically using me (whether she noticed or not) for emotional support or comfort, when I was really, really in love with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what I'm trying to say here, is that I've had a rough childhood and also really bad romantic and sexual scenarios with some people before my actual gf. She's amazing, caring for me, attentive, fun to be with and we're getting both satisfied overall. But since I started liking her, I've been fighting against my own mind constantly so I don't stop loving her (referring to emotional numbness), fall on past guilt, anxiety of her not really liking me, and a lot of other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all of those, I knew that what  I had to do (which has ben working) was ignore some insecurities and rationalize others, but anyway NOT stopping to meet her; that's a way of telling your mind \"yes, the best thing is to prevent her from hurting you\". And well, I'm glad I haven't stopped meeting her, because everything besides those problems have been going realy great.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yesterday a new feature - which I actually know from past experiences - kicked in. 'The desperate need to be with her', and that doesn't feel right. One thing is to want to spend time with someone, another one is feeling afraid of not being with her. For more context, she went on a plan with her family and I couldn't go, and that's rationally fine but my anxiety was just like 'you're missing something important', and the thought of her was like 'I really want to be with her, and I should'. All of this from an anxious point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get that I don't need to feel like that, because it comes from fear of abandonment, and while it always is a possibility I don't need to focus on that because it's not healthy. Today we're meeting, and not because I thought yesterday 'we should meet right now, the first momen we can'. I just told her to go out because I thought it was a good thing, and to keep the relationship going. It's not a bad thing but, here's the question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm afraid to strengthen the anxiety by meeting her. I don't want that desperation because it's not realistic and comes from past experiences, I just want to meet her nicely as we've been doing and let this old pattern go. Does this sound healthy? :\n",
      "Planning things with her besides anxiety or depression giving me false signs? Like, acting out how I really want and not how these emotions tell me to? This will lower them overtime, but for when this anxiety comes in (or even if it happens when I'm with her) is it okay to be with her? Or am I strengthening it?\n",
      "\n",
      "What sounds right to me is to work this anxiety if it comes back when I'm not with her, instead of feeding it? Maybe I'm just overthinking it and it was like a residual thing and won't come by again? Because as I said, rationally I'm not like \"shit, I really have to be with her or else what am I gonna do?\", is just a random emotion. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "[18M] Desperation for spending time with my partner [18F] coming from anxiety due to past trauma and awful romantic experiences. I'm not desperate on a rational level, and this is not a common emotion for me (for the month we've been as partners). It's something I notice that comes from the past and that has nothing to do with my new relationship. Do I just ignore this emotion or do I have to do something with it to not feed it on the long term? Because meeting her out of love is not a bad thing, but from anxiety it is, and I can't control sometimes if I feel anxious or not. Is it better to not meet her if I'm anxious? On your experience what sounds best?\n",

      "Body text: We have been together for almost a year. We are long distance, he lives in France, I live in Italy. I actually really care for him, and I like him a lot, and I know that I love him. We are in a really healthy relationship. We really don’t have any kind of problem. We see each other once a month for 5 days, I go there or he comes here; the rest of the time we FaceTime and we live our lives. Now, there is one thing that really bothers me in the relationship… I am a really thoughtful person, I like making presents, showing my love by remembering the little things, baking, writing poetry… he doesn’t. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that he is at fault for this, because he has ways of showing me love, and I feel loved, but sometimes I really wish that somebody would treat me like a princess. I will make an example I love flowers, I buy them for myself, and everyone knows how much I appreciate a bouquet. He never gifted me flowers The first months I tried to be subtle, by hinting at it, but the last 4 months I straight up asked for flowers and he never did. And I know that it doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I just cannot comprehend how a person that says to love you, wouldn’t put a little effort in something so little. And no, I don’t pretend gifts all the time, but I would like my little attentions reciprocated. You could also grab some flowers from the park (said it directly to him multiple times) I don’t resent him for this, I think that he is a wonderful guy, and I understand that not everyone shows love the same way, but it’s been a year know and yes, I may sound really silly, but I does make my sad that I’m never going to wake up with breakfast ready, ora have flowers in a vase when I come home. So maybe I should leave, but not because I think he is an idiot, I love him, but because maybe his way of loving is not mine. Because it’s a stupid flower today, but it shows lack of consideration… (Obviously I do all the stuff that I expect back, so it’s not like I want a slave) Am I overreacting? And please, don’t insult me, I’m young, I don’t know many things in life, and I’m here for some advice :/\n",

      "Body text: Okay so to preface, I am a 18 F and my boyfriend is a 18 M. I’m a senior in high school and going off to college soon. This is my first relationship ever and it’s lasted almost 10 months so far. My boyfriend is my very best friend and getting to know him over the past 10 months has really changed my life.

I love being with him though and I value the time we’ve spent together and the memories we made. I never want to lose him. I’m scared that the idea of a boyfriend was more exciting to me than actually being with him.

      "once i got into the relationship i knew i couldn’t let my world revolve around him, like i’ve seen others. i have a lot of hobbies, i volunteer, i play a sport, i go to the gym, and i have a very full and busy social life (i like to party and go out and do everything there is to offer!). but i still feel like i want more and more and i still think about him. a couple months ago i got a whole internship, working 8-5, and then going out with friends in the evenings, but at work i would still daydream about him at my desk, counting down the days til i see him again. during this time i had the internship we were long distance (3 months).\n",
      "\n",
      "tmi but almost every night of that internship i would fantasize about him. he’d call like once every 2-3 days and we’d have an hour and a half long conversation catching eachother up on our lives. but during those calls, after the first half hour it felt like i was on borrowed time, like he was about to say he’s sleepy and hang up and so i have to rush and say everything i wanna say and maybe try and be more interesting so he stays on the call longer. i can’t call him really, because he’s busy, and it feels like if he wanted to talk to me he would call me, so when i call him outside of this he’s almost like “why are you calling?”. he will chat with me when i do but it’s clear he’s got stuff to be doing and he has to get back to, so i don’t do this because him ending the call just makes me feel sad again (ik that’s unreasonable, but it’s like why start something when you know him ending it is gonna hurt)\n",
      "\n",
      "i’ve never been the one to end the interaction, it’s never got to the point where im sick of him. i always always always could be with him more. he’s always the one who says “okay well im sure you’ve got work to do” or “i’m sure you’ve got to be going soon”. he could stay round my house for a week and i wouldn’t have any complaints tbh. \n",
      "\n",
      "so yes, i have hobbies, i have interests, i have incredible friends who i love. i haven’t switched round my life to make room for him, i am also doing a degree and have a social life. and yet i still am so so so obsessed with this man. help!  it can’t be healthy, and it controls my nervous system, waiting for him to text back, holding myself back to stop myself being hurt etc.\n",

      "Today i write to you because something's been on my mind alot and yesterday kind of shook me. I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half, we're both 20, and i used to not spend alot of time with her in the first 6 months of the relationship. I grew to try to become a better partner, so i tried to balance my time more and for a long time we were both fine with how we were seeing each other, or so i thought. Some times we would have some fights; about how i don't consider her and how if you're in love you should want to spend every waking second with your s/o, but i never truly believed that. I often like to spend abit of time apart be it a day or two to recharge, but i tried to agree with her.\n",

I work 40h a week from 10am to 7pm, and i often want to try and work on my writing, art etc, because i spend the weekend at her place and sometimes even days of the week. Say i get there at 8 and i leave at 10. At first i thought it was just me and i should bottle it up and just work on a morning routine to do my stuff, but i don't think i can hide from it anymore. I just feel like i need abit more personal time. we've been seeing for 5-6 days a week for the last few weeks on my days off and i don't want to share her that i would like to spend some of this time alone, and i really need your help on this; i'll share you why.\n",

      "My girlfriend has depression. She's feeling slightly better, but she often has alot of ideas that are unhealthy and she often needs reassurance and a presence. I tried to be that to her, but at the same time i've grown to neglect some things that made me \"me\" if that make sense. I'll still try to be there for her best i can, but the thing is that we've had this argument many times and she used to say that things only ever went my way and i didn't want to see her. It hurt because i genuinely tried to meet both our needs more as time passed, but now she feels satisfied and i don't know how to communicate to her that i just need some breathing time because yesterday she said something that scared me alittle;\n",

      "So i was telling her how i felt tired generally and wanted to spend a day home without going to work, and she asked me if i wanted to spend it with her or at her place- That's cool and i would love that but maybe not that day, the thing is that i didn't say it to her because i didn't want her to think that i don't value her or that she bothers me, a concern that she has and that she beats herself over a lot. A similar thing happened a few days ago where i told her that i would go to the restaurant with my mom on saturday night in two weeks because i haven't been seeing her alot lately given i get home really late and she asked me if we would see each other- She then asked me why i wouldn't move it to the friday so we have two whole days together etc and i felt overwhelmed but she let it go- Thing is she wasn't feeling it, she told me it's alright because we can't be together every weekend but was visibly hurt by it.\n",

      "Body text: I (26F) have been in a relationship with my (32M) partner for almost 3 years. In the beginning of our relationship I saw that he went a bit too over board with alcohol and really any drug under the sun but thought nothing of it as he was a functioning human being who held down a job. When he would get drunk and sometimes when he was sober he would get verbally abusive. Not a degrading me abusive but loud shouting and monologuing about how hard his life has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a beautiful loving relationship for 2 years and in the last 6 months I watched as his sobriety started becoming less frequent. He would drink while working and every night when he came home from work, not excessively but enough to be drunk. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the last month things started to get really bad. He ended up on an all night bender with a woman from the past that we both used to work with and who he had a fling with before me, stayed out all night with her drinking and doing cocaine. I was up all night stewing in anger, only for him to come home at 7am WITH her to our house. I flipped out obviously and he later told me that she had kissed him twice. I was immediately betrayed but we were talking it out as he didn't actually sleep with her or intended to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The week following this, his family came to visit us from overseas and we went away to the countryside to have some time out of the city. While there he was using benzos with alcohol and slipped completely into a psychosis. He was verbally abusive not only to me, but to his entire family. To the point where his father called the cops on him and had him arrested. Twice. He remembers none of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have since left him it's been about 2 weeks and he has hit rock bottom. Which I predicted he would. My entire family now knows the situation and how dire it's become over the last 6 months. I have since realized that when drunk he was incredibly verbally abusive but I didn't realize for a long time. His addictions fully took control over him and I didn't realize I was basically helping him function as I don't drink. So I would make sure to drive and keep him safe from himself. But I don't have the energy to play nurse to him anymore and need to take care of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, in the last 5 days he's sobered up and realized what he's lost with me. He's saying all the right things about getting sober and doing it for himself and not for me. But I have told him he would need to be on his own for at least a year sober in order to learn how to be a new person without substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is still very insistent on the fact that he loves me and wants to do right by himself and by me by going through this. He has stated that he wants to marry me one day. We met up and I explained all the reasons that I am angry and the verbal abuse. He says he is willing to fix himself.\n",

It was so fun and I felt so lucky, but I also learned that my 'best friend' was asked to help plan and basically she was being rude, short and didn't participate in the party planning. She also didn't show up which I was hurt by. we had gone out earlier in the week to celebrate my birthday, so it's not like she forgot, but I thought it was so mean of her to a. be rude to my family and b. bail on the planning and not show up at all.

You had plenty of notice to take off work or even stop by for half an hour but you simply didn't want to which really hurt me. we could have gotten past it but the way that you spoke to me yesterday when i was trying to tell you how i felt was extremely hurtful and i don't care to be treated that way anymore.'\n",

I want to stay and have my own kids after marriage. He is M40. I am F33. Im back and fourth with myself a lot on whether I can be fully accepting of the situation. I like his kids and ex wife. The problem is that it takes away from me. The money is tied up in them, we can't pick up and go. I do not always want them included in every little thing. When we get a place, I will be sharing my finances space and life with 3 kids that are not mine. Its doable but so is starting over with someone else who has not been married or had kids. If your heart is involved, how can you decide to leave? Part of me wants to stay cause it's not that bad. But the other part feels like she's missing out and wants to part ways. It will be painful but doable as well. I also believe that the partner needs to come first as much as the kids do. It should be their mother but she has a new life now and they didn't work out. But if the only true way to mean as much to somebody is to be there before kids then im not sure I agree with this. I believe your life partner is a love your kids can't give you and should be valued just as much as someone values their children. They are 3 teenagers. How would you come to a decision?\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi everyone. I have trouble bringing things up that may cause an issue but I think it's time. My boyfriend  is just a highly critical/judgmental & negative person when it comes to others. He's bothered by the way people look at him in public, the way people dress/look physically, people's personal choices as far as beliefs & personal choices, everything. Early in our relationship we did have quite a few discussions about his views & it seems that he took what I said into consideration & was open to me educating him on things. I do not think I changed his views completely, but he at least does not make ignorant comments (as much) anymore. I hate to think that he's just censoring his self around me. I like for people to feel like they can be themselves. \n",

      "We also have 1 child each & the kids have been spending more time together with us. I notice that his daughter is like a mini him. It's annoying hearing the things they have to say & I definitely do not like telling people about their child. However, I think it's time to have more discussions because he's been hinting at wanting to move in together (not anytime soon).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main things sparing him in this relationship are that his critical & judgmental ways are never directed at me, he holds me in a very high regard. We have a lot of fun together, he's very understanding of my space & moods, we have fun with the kids, our families get along, literally everything is great except his worldview. \n",

      "I'm also a very sensitive person in general so when I talk to some people in my life, they don't really see it as a huge deal. I do enjoy being with him & he's supportive in lots of ways. I'm nervous about having tough conversations because 1) they are extremely difficult for me in relationships. 2) I worry that he's going to be confused about why I didn't express things more openly this entire time. How can I let him know that his critical ways are exhausting & annoying? Thank you in advance<3\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone! This is going to be a mouthful but here I go…\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I have been together for 2 years now but we dated in high school for 3 years. I know his family in and out and when I was younger, I liked his mother because she was the “cool mom” but even then I disagreed with who she was as a person and her parenting style but I was a teenager so I never thought too deeply to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward, I am 24, my partner 25 and I hate this woman… for the way she treated my partner and his brother and the pain she caused them due to her alcoholism, poor relationships with men, lack of financial literacy and overall loud, narcissistic personality. They grew up without fathers, raised by their grandmother while she chased men and got drunk every weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "My partner left to go and work overseas last year and everything has gone to shit since then. He had to leave his younger brother here and he is like a father to him. Since then, his brother has become angrier, depressed and desperately needs therapy because he’s resorted to smoking w**d and using x*nax to cope with the issues of dealing with his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before his brother went down this road,  I was the one who tried to push for him to go to therapy. His mother made the entire conversation about herself, belittled him and then afterwards told me that she doesn’t want him to go to therapy because he will realise that he hates her. Funny enough, he already hates her and is dishing her a fat plate of rudeness, arguments and chaos to her, which i feel is a direct consequence for her neglect as a parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation with his brother saddens me greatly as I grew up with this little boy. I’ve been protecting him since I was a teenager, I was 16 yet I removed him from his mother’s company when she got too drunk and to this day, I try everything that I can possibly do to protect him and keep his interests alive, yet it feels I am watching his potential and happiness deplete day by day from being in the same environment as his mother. I’ve witnessed my partners mother berate him, get drunk and argue with him, allow him to be around grown ups who are drunk and swearing, fighting… she’s brought so many men around him and when they leave her, she blames him… this is only the half of it\n",
      "\n",
      "His teenage brother has now decided, he will be moving overseas to live with us (once I eventually immigrate and when he turns 18)… I love this child and I want the best for him but I can’t help but think it’s unfair that he has a fully capable mother who CAN look after him but my partner and I will assume this responsibility. Nonetheless my partner and I have agreed this will be best for him so it is part of our plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this has happened and my partner still sees his mother in an enduring light. It’s as if he makes excuses for her, saying she’s broken, unhappy and she just needs to stop drinking to fix all of this. I heavily disagree, I believe she has had little to no responsibility for these boys and she’s neglected them for her own pursuits in life… I don’t tell him that though\n",
      "\n",
      "But In February, I told my partner that enough is enough… I will no longer be visiting his mother and that I do not agree with her and how she has neglected his brother and that I am deeply concerned about his behaviour. Since then, his brother has become 100x worse and his mother has done nothing about it. The issue is, my partner still comes to speak to me about everything that is going on and I try my best to listen and support him but at the time time, I cannot control the fucking disgust and anger I have towards his mother. Lately when I’ve started to disagree with him, he has said that I am argumentative and combative when he talks about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my eyes, I’m not trying to be. I’m simply questioning his reality and views and bringing a different perspective to the table, while still trying my best to make my partner feel safe and comfortable to talk to me. At the same time, I understand this is a complex family dynamic but it hurts me to see the part my partner plays in his own suffering, by covering up for someone who continuously hurts him and his family… I believe seeing her as the real villain that she is would set him free but it’s not my place to enforce that.\n",

      "My husband(32) and I (29)have been married for 5 years, and this has always been a part of our relationship — even when we were dating. He loves texting girls.

      "\n",
      "For example, he works out a lot and has sent progress pics to one of these friends (a girl), saying it’s the same as if he were sending them to a guy. I also saw that she sent him an outfit pic — not suggestive, but a mirror selfie. That’s not something I do with my friends (male or female), and it just feels kind of intimate to me.\n",

      "Another time, we were out together one night and he wasn’t on his phone much. Later, I saw a message from her that said something like, “I haven’t heard from you, hope you’re okay, goodnight.” It kind of stopped me in my tracks. I never text anyone enough to have a “goodnight” text routine — and it made me realize they must talk a lot.\n",

      "Title: I need advice\n",
      "Body text: **TL;DR: My fiancé wants to go to university for four years after we get married and he leaves the military, not having a clear plan about building a life with me and starting a family. What should I do?**\n",
      "\n",
      "I, 28(F), have been with my fiancé, 27(M), for nearly 3 years. He is currently in the military and planning to leave at the end of this year. I work full-time and make a decent amount of money, which allows me to put aside a portion of it to contribute to the plan of buying a house together. When we started dating, he had started going to college online to become an engineer after leaving the military. Nevertheless, he has not made any progress, which led him to change schools recently and start from zero because he argued that the program was the issue, on top of working simultaneously. I understand the difficulties of working and studying at the same time, but I also see his lack of commitment and drive, especially as someone who is going to college to study engineering later in life, prioritising games, movies and other distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we are months away from getting married and living together, I'm starting to feel unsure about our future. When we talk about finances after he leaves, it seems like he has no idea what he will be doing to contribute to our income and just wants to go to college for the next 4 years. That means I will be the only person making a consistent income for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been left with the task of finding solutions for us, to make sure we don't blow our savings and continue to be on track to afford buying a house. Since I will be the only one working, we are planning on moving to my parents’ house for now, after the wedding, and see how it goes, but honestly, I'm having a mental breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a woman who is nearly 30 (I’ll turn 29 in October, he is nearly 2 years younger) , I want to start my life after spending the last 2 years in a long-distance relationship, stuck because of his commitments, waiting for the day when we would be able to be together and start building our lives. Now that we are about to be free from the difficulties that the military brings, I feel like I will have to continue to sacrifice for us. I am well aware that at this stage, I need to start thinking about having children, being stable. I work so hard, but now I feel like I will have to be budgeting for the next four years and not enjoy a comfortable life, not be able to have kids, and live with my parents until something changes, not even being sure if he will be able to complete the degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we talk, he just says that it will all work out, but doesn't bring a clear plan at least for the first months or years, and doesn't help with what needs to be done. People around him talk to him as if he was still 18, without husband responsibilities, saying that college is the most important and shouldn't worry about anything else. I already feel like a mom cause I need to tell him to study, to take university seriously. I love him very much and he is a lovely man, but I'm scared the next years are going to take a huge toll on me.\n",

      "Title: me (21) and my bf (21) are in a happy relationship but he’s very financially unstable, not very smart, and he isn’t passionate. I don’t know if it’s time to let go.\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR : my boyfriend (21) and I (21) have a very healthy relationship. He protects my heart more than anything, and he gives me what he can but he is so bad with his money. he’s not the brightest and he lacks some common sense. He was the only child, but like most people, we’ve had to teach ourselves things. he isn’t passionate about anything, and we basically only have small talk . In a way, I feel like his mother and he seems to kinda get upset when we have conversations because of how much I have to correct him or I have to basically teach him everything. I love him, and he loves me even more, but I want a partner who I can depend on and I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be long, and I’m still gonna try to sum it up, but someone please. If you could take the time to read I would appreciate it because I genuinely need help and don’t know what to do. How do you even bring a conversation like this up to a partner without completely crushing their soul? My boyfriend and I are both 21 years old. He is an amazing partner emotionally. We got into a relationship quick after meeting each other, it just felt right. He was so emotionally open that I think it made us fall in love very quickly. he is very gentle with me. He’s never raised his voice. He doesn’t argue, and he always puts me first when it comes to his plans or prioritizing quality time together. he isn’t controlling, and just overall We have a very healthy relationship. We have been together for almost 11 months, and from the beginning, we have always talked about our future together like marriage, kids, and, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I met him, he has always been on and off of jobs. Probably every 2 to 3 months he has to get a new job and he’s never been financially stable for more than 3 weeks. He grew up only child with a single mother. So no one around him has really taught him anything about money. Without being said i’ve dealt with financially unstable partners before, and it’s something that irritates me deep in my core, because it’s one thing to go through that for a little bit, but since I’ve known him, this has been the case, and there’s so many times, I have had to almost worry for him, because I feel like he doesn’t have anything in the bank. He doesn’t talk about his financials with me, and he’s been using money apps, so I’m sure he has a lot of built-up debt. he has to unlock his card Every time he goes and makes a purchase because he’s scared he will get a charge on his card. Except clearly If you have a charge on your card, Then it’s probably a bill that you have to pay . he owes money at the Gym because he never paid his membership and says that he will never pay it. He can’t download apps, because he hasn’t paid his Apple Music and etc. This is just to name a few examples of how terrible his money habits are .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " I grew up with my mother working, and also splitting bills with my father, who didn’t even pick up his dish after he finished dinner, so I’ve made it very clear that if I am expected to do all the house, chores like cooking and cleaning every single day then I will not be splitting bills especially when it comes time to have children . Most of the time I pay for my own food and I can count on my hands. How many dates we’ve been on and there’s only been one time. He planned one date by himself, and that was only after I told him to do that :/ he says he’s gonna do all these things, but they are always just empty words that never come true. When he says he’s gonna do some thing, or get some thing for me. I always just smile and nod . I grew up the oldest child and my parents also didn’t teach me about money, but that is where I realized I had to teach myself everything, especially now where any information is so accessible. I hate that. He isn’t at the maturity level, where he realizes he needs to be financially literate, and do things for himself, like creating budgets, or saving money . He is very undependable, and I could never ask him for help if I needed it . \n",
      "\n",
      "I love learning about everything that I can. I feel like I have a bunch of just random little facts about most topics people could think of including music, art space nature, animals, psychology,  Just honestly everything and I feel like I’m a very intellectual person who loves to have deep conversations about all of those things. I feel like me, and him can’t ever have actual deep conversations, because he will say some dumb nonsense or just nothing at all. And I feel like it’s because we aren’t mentally at the same place. In general, he’s not a very smart person, and sometimes he can lack a common sense. I feel like sometimes when we have conversations he gets irritated because I’m correcting him on most things because he just doesn’t know much , he’s not an idiot by any means there is just so much that he doesn’t know, and for his age. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like most of the things tend to just be common knowledge. I just almost feel like I’m his mother, and he is my child. it truly gets exhausting, dealing with my own things, and then also me worrying about him and helping him create budgets. I wish he could figure things out by himself, and I also wish that we could connect on things that are important to one another. And no, you don’t have to be a genius for me to feel a connection with you, but I feel like he isn’t passionate about anything. I feel like that’s what it makes me emotionally unfilled and now I almost resent him for it. And I feel like I’m acting not like myself around him, and just more bland and dry. I grew up and only child, I don’t wanna teach a man life skills when no one taught me. And I definitely don’t wanna teach a man how to take care of a woman financially enough or at least be financially stable to were she feels stability in her life, and like she could be a future with this person. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know he’s struggling and a lot of the job situations really aren’t his fault. But why is it that I always have to deal with men like this. I’m trying to figure out my own life , and it gets so draining when you can’t ever relax, and you can’t have your partner just take over for you and you’ll be comfortable enough with him to where you know you don’t have to do things yourself. Instead of being more feminine when I’m with him, I feel more masculine, like I have to take the role of leader, and tell him what to do. that’s definitely not the life that I wanna live.\n",
      "\n",
      "and I know he didn’t have any handouts but I just feel drained. And I know Love isn’t always enough to keep a relationship. I don’t know if these are things that could be resolved or if I’m being too hard on him, but I know what I want. And I know I’m not asking for too much. I think it might be time to let go, but I couldn’t see myself without this person. maybe we’re just still young and I know that we don’t have things figured out, but it’s just sad because even emotionally I’m craving something deeper, and a more passionate love but I truly do love him, and he is genuinely SUCH a good and patient man. We’re best friends, and we spend more time together than not. I just wish he was smart enough to help himself as well as being intelectual or maybe even smart enough to be passionate and feel deep emotions about things. how could you possibly bring this up to a partner who loves you even more than you love them without completely crushing them when they are nothing but so so caring and loving to you? \n",

      "Title: My girlfriend doesn’t initiate sex (lesbian relationship)\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR; :My girlfriend won’t initiate sex even after I’ve had a conversation with her about it, she says she’s hyper sexual and loves sex, but unless I initiate it then..there ya go. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So ima start off by saying that a lot of these posts on here about the girlfriend not initiating sex is about a straight couple, usually a woman to a man. I don’t know if it’s because women have a lower testosterone level than men or what, but that’s usually how it goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation is a bit different, I’m a woman (22) and my gf (26) doesn’t initiate sex, we haven’t been together long that’s my main issue. We’ve been together for 3 months, known eachother for longer but only officially been together 3. My girlfriend has expressed to me she likes being dominant in bed but honestly most the time I don’t want to be the submissive one. Too many exes in the past have made me feel bad about wanting to be the submissive (most women in the lesbian world ARENT dominant) and so over the years I’ve kinda changed my role. I like being the top now. Only every blue moon do I like being dominated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now don’t get me wrong she ALSO loves being submissive ontop of being dominant, whenever we do have sex it’s very intimate, whenever I’m inside her with a strap or my fingers are inside or I’m eating her out or whatever I’m doing, she’s always touching my chest or kissing me or rubbing all over my body. It’s extremely erotic on both our ends and she seems like she really enjoys it once I start. I don’t doubt she likes the sex pretty much is what I’m getting at. Even after she finishes and I ask her if she’s done she says no and wants me to keep going. We could go for a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I swear it’s seemed like if I don’t initiate things they never happen. I’ve been questioning if she’s into me, but I stop myself because she’s extremely closed off from everyone else. Like I mean she’s told me if she didn’t have to go to work, I’d be the only person she’d ever wanna spend all her days with. She constantly tries to go out of her way to do nice things for me, she compliments me quite a bit, and she always tells me she loves me. Maybe she’s just not sexually attracted to me? Maybe she’s too shy asking about it? \n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought up before that she never initiates sex, but I didn’t word it like that. I worded it like “why do you never show me you want sex? Like maybe a certain look or you bite your lip or you give me subtle hints that you want it?” And all she’s givin me is two answers; that she does feel like she shows it it’s just I don’t seem to see any hints (I swear she never hints at it I’m not just being dumb haha), or she says that she’s not used to being the one to initiate sex so it’s strange to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "A little background, she’s been with men and women in the last and the men specifically always initiated LOTS of sex is what she told me. She always was being asked and never had to be the one initiating things. But if that’s the case wouldn’t she try ti put in some effort to try to change that? It doesn’t take much to ask for sex or to give hints. If I’ve spoken to her about this before then why hasn’t there been any changes? And since our relationship is so fresh you’d think we’d still be having lots of sex 3 months in. When we first got together it was a lot of sex, almost every night. She expressed to me in the past she’s hypersexual and that she’s “like to have sex once or twice a day” I’m like :0 . I’m not the most sexual person in the world so that’s quite a bit for me BUT I mainly get off when someone gives me hints they want it. So now we could go a week or two and nothing, unless I initiate. I’m convinced if I stop completely we just won’t have sex. And I’m not the most sexual creature in the world like I’ve said so it wouldn’t bother me too much if we don’t have sex but I definitely feel more connected with her on a deeper level when we do get intimate. She’s also explained to me she feels more connected when we have sex too. What should I do? \n",

      "Body text: Hi guys! Looking for some advice. My boyfriend, M18, has signs of being an avoidant attachment style (I think but please feel free to correct me), meanwhile I, F18, am an anxious attachment style (again, I think). We have been dating for a few months and are long-distance (but same time zone).  \n",
      "I am looking for advice because our relationship isn't the healthiest, and I am crying every day and night. He doesn't communicate his feelings or what he needs with me, and I can't read his mind. He has had a lot going on recently so I've been trying to keep an open mind, thinking that maybe he just isn't emotionally available to give me what I need right now, but it is still hurting me and weighing on me.  \n",
      "He's working most hours of the day now (2 jobs) and with everything else going on in his life, he hasn't been talking to me much. I've asked what he needs from me to better support him through these hard times but didn't get anything out of it. When I mention something that hurt me or that I didn't like, my feelings are often dismissed, like he doesn't care. I am also an overthinker, so I fear maybe there is something being done behind my back on his side. If not that, it really just feels like he doesn't want me anymore.  \n",
      "I want this relationship to work out, but all it is doing right now is hurting me.  \n",

It feels like he doesn't care about me anymore and doesn't want me anymore. It doesn't even feel like he's treating me as his partner, so I am starting to overthink. Pls SOS\n",

      "Title: Clingy/paranoid girlfriend is driving me nuts\n",
      "Body text: Me (19M) and my girlfriend(18F) are going on 8 months into our relationship. I like this girl but some things are starting to get annoying and I don’t know how to approach it. What do I do cause I want to stay but have want my priorities straight? I’ve tried talking to her about my feelings but instantly feel shut down and guilty because it becomes about her and I can’t speak my mind without her crying. Basically what’s going on is her family has had a lot of unfortunate events happen. Her parents  divorced when she was young and she says that her cause her extreme anxiety and paranoia. Basically daddy issues. She’s has good relations ship with both her parents but there is a lot of drama between my girlfriend’s younger sister and their stepdad/biological father. There has been issues between her mom and step dad that I heard about 24/7 and now it’s about her sister and her dad 24/7. Her little sister gets on my nerves because she believes she is the main character in any family relationship. All of it gets put onto my girlfriend which then gets passed down to me via crying, silent treatment, and clinginess.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend his extremely clingy and emotional. For example, I try to leave her dorm and she will be g for me to stay and hold her longer b it then when I’m about to open the door she asks for another hug and starts crying because I’m leaving. She blames it on her dad leaving. I can’t go hangout with friends at their fraternity without her crying and complaining about the chance of me cheating in her which isn’t going to happen btw. Blames that on her dad. I trust her all the way so much so where I go home for weekends on end without ever worrying about her cheating or doing something inappropriate. She really doesn’t have any friends, hobbies, or social life tho so I guess that’s why I’m not worried about anything which sounds terrible of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her anxiety is through the roof. So much so to where it affects me and I don’t have history of anxiety. I am the type of person to believe that anxiety or depression doesn’t affect me because I have better stuff to do than worry about it. She constantly asks me to promise her that I’m not gonna leave or if I’m ok when nothing would have provoked it besides stress from school. She’s extremely paranoid about me going out with friends or having a good time at frats like I said because she’s afraid other girls will hit on me. I’m a somewhat decent looking guy and I’ve been approached once by a girl who asked if I had a girlfriend. Obviously I did have a girlfriend so nothing happened. She’s cries thinking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had some issues in the past where we went through stuff and she treated me like harshly and put all the attention on herself. I like space after something happens but it was impossible to do that without her being mad at me. Ever since then I’ve wished she was more mature and started thinking about what life would be like without a girlfriend or with one that was more mature. I’m over the whole situation except for that thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am an extremely busy person all year round rather it be at college doing a  major in mechanical engineering and a minor in ag sci or working 50-70 hours a week on my dads farm. I’m afraid the lack of time spent together is gonna boost her anxiety and paranoia. I’m also stressed because of finals coming up and I have told her I would go on a camping trip with her. Unfortunately, I got guilted into going because of what’s happening with her family right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, I’m tired of the added stress from our relationship. The only issue I have is I’m scared to loose her because she’s the first girl that has given me chance. We are each others first and have done so many things I will remember for ever. She wants to learn my hobby’s and thing I’m interested in which no one has before. To be frank, I love her and all of our good experiences but the bad ones are dragging on me. Sorry for the long read.\n",

Weve been dating for two years now in a sort of long distance relationship (its around 400 miles and we meet a lot), and even though she said on multiple occasions that she wants to have sex and shes sending me lots of nudes when were apart, once were together her attitude is very different.

She does on occasion watch a lot of tiktoks that are horror stories about very unlikely injuries you can get when having sex or getting pregnant though.

      "Body text: My best friend (21F) and I (24NB) have been friends for 10 years. About a year ago, we became platonic partners; However, after what happened, we \"broke up\" and are currently friends.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She used to do drugs. I don't know how often, I didn't ask, nor did I want to know. But I have a phobia of drugs due to an event that happened in my life. I won't go into it, I don't like reliving it, but it involves death. I would have episodes where I became deeply afraid of her to the point I couldn't handle talking to her. In order to be her friend and talk to her normally, I had to pretend she didn't do drugs. I know you're probably wondering why we were friends in that case. She didn't always do drugs. She only started them a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally this lead to our relationship becoming shaky. The drugs resulted in a lot of \"events\", she would lash out at me while under the influence, I would lash out at her because I was afraid of her. It wasn't good. Notably, this built up for roughly a year and a half.\n",

      "We talked during this and she pointed out how we promised to always work through our problems instead of leaving. I felt guilty, because yeah, I did promise that. So I started getting doubts. And, then, she offered to quit the drugs. But the thing is. She said it was easy and the drugs meant nothing to her. So. She had the power to quit this whole time. She just didn't. Even when it hurt me, even when she knew it hurt me. She didn't stop until it was going to affect her, with me leaving. She just didn't care how it hurt me until it affected her.\n",

      "The drugs are supposedly gone, but I don't trust that honestly. We're doing worksheets and trying to repair the relationship. We're looking for relationship therapy.

      "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost a year. We were in a medium-distance relationship for most of it, but it was going fine. Two months ago, he moved to a different continent for six months. I just flew in to visit him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days before my flight, we had an argument. During that fight, he told me he doesn’t know if he still loves me. He said he might just be with me because it’s comfortable and he doesn’t want to hurt me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got here, we talked again. He told me I make him feel at peace and that I make him happy, but he’s not sure if it’s love or just comfort. Ever since I arrived, though, he’s been acting like the perfect boyfriend. He’s been affectionate, attentive, and supportive, overall exhibiting all the signs of what i would call love. He used to hate PDA, but now he’s glued to me in public. Additionally, he said he wants to take care of me and of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a history of commitment issues. He even told me he probably needs therapy. But I don’t know what to do with that, especially since I’ve basically been acting like his therapist while I’m here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disregarding the fact that this is an absolutely diabolical thing to do to someone, I’m just extremely confused by how I am supposed to approach this. I love him so so much, but if he doesn’t love me, there’s not really anything I can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 3 weeks I'll be here, he basically wants us to play house and act like everything is normal while he figures his feelings out, but that, in my humble opinion, is once again a diabolical thing to do to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if I should just accept defeat and take these weeks with him as a gentle transition into never seeing him again, or hold on to hope that he wakes up and realises he is in love with me? (In my logical brain, this sounds like an extremely foolish thing to do to myself.) \n",

      "Title: How Do You Salvage a Relationship That’s This Unequal Between My Girlfriend (19F) And Me (19M)?\n",
      "Body text: The other day I was scrolling through reels and saw a like of a mutual friend of me and my girlfriend on a reel related to cheating and hating your boyfriend and I was intrigued by it because I knew she was dating, so I checked her profile and she had actually removed the posts she had with her boyfriend so I thought she had broken up with him. I am not the type to get involved in drama or even give a shit about anything unless its personal but my girlfriend loves gossip so I thought she would want to hear this because that friend was a mutual of me and my girlfriend. When i told this to her she actually lashed out at me because this mutual friend had some bikini pictures up on her highlights and my girlfriend thought i opened her account and saw some of her pictures which made my girlfriend feel insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now i admit even i would feel a little insecure but the point is if i really wanted to see boobies why would i open instagram and even if i did why would i tell my girlfriend. either way i tried to understand her perspective too and tried to calm her down until she called me a 'desperate pervert' and a '(insert really bad word for someone who sleeps around alot)' for doing that not just once but multiple times. which hurt me so i asked her for a breakup, after realizing the gravity she switched to apologizing for what she said and asked to meet up the next day. after meeting up with her i asked her to give me some time as the things she called me were very insulting and kind of a dealbreaker for me but i told her ill try, i didnt make any promises though. when we went back to our homes she asked me to join a google meet so that we can watch some videos together and on the google meet when she shared her screen i noticed her DM with some guy with a shirtless pfp and immediately i confronted her about it. to which she replied 'i just wished him happy birthday', 'he is like my brother i know him from before you' and 'i didnt even notice his pfp till you pointed it out'. and honestly my issue isnt with her wishing the guy i have no issue with that, my issue is that was what i did so bad compared to what she did that i deserved to be insulted like that?  its the double standards that genuinely baffle me. something that makes it worse somehow is the fact that the guy who she wished used to have a crush on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this is not even the first time she has actually shown this double standard. it was actually my misfortune that my ex was in the same university as me and my girlfriend, my girlfriend got mad at me when i even noticed my ex. i cant have a premonition that my ex was going to walk on this particular path at this time so i should not look in that general direction and it wasnt even like i was staring at her or even making eye contact i looked away as soon as i realized who she was. to that my girlfriend said 'you are definitely going to cheat on me with her'. on the contrary she would go on to send one of her male friends a voice note of her singing the happy birthday song for him which btw made him feel so special he texted me 'bro your gf is so nice she made me feel so special on my bday'. sucks to hear another guy say this. on this her response was 'how could u doubt me?' and 'i cant control how he felt' and the classic 'hes like a brother to me'. thats true but again her she wouldnt hold me to the same standard she holds herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now i have left my relationship in kind of a half dead state asking her for time to decide whether i want to continue this or no. while i do love her for other things she has done i have actually had enough of this bullshit and these were just two of the many times this has happened earlier that i dont even care to recount here. its reached such such a consistent scale that a year back i used to have panic attacks when she pulled this kind of crap but nowadays i just sigh and either try to ignore it because its not worth my time. i just wanted to get some opinion on this and would yall still try to salvage it and how? or would yall just leave at this point?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR My girlfriend has been holding me to her standards that she herself doesnt follow. she basically gets mad at me and insults or tries to one up me when i do something or i did something in the past before i dated her and when turns out she did something similar or even worse she immediately turns the guns on me by saying how i can doubt her and i should trust her more. the post mentions the specifics of the situation but my question is just to know what you yall would do in this situation and if you would choose to salvage how would you do it?\n",

      "Body text: Me ( 18M ) and my girlfriend ( 17F ) have been dating for over half a year now and we're still in some kind of honeymoon phase. We're very affectionate with each other and everyone knows us as the lovebirds.\n",

We decided not to try dating because our views of a relationship were so different, but we remained as friends and then before winter I started dating my current girlfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Me and that guy friend don't hang out outside of school and we just chit chat during breaks, but my girlfriend doesn't like it at all. According to her the guy friend took an advantage of me, even tho I've said that the kissing and stuff was okay with me. She also gets a little jealous when I talk to him. I've told her that if she wants I can cut him off of my life but she just keeps saying that she can't take my friend away from me, but she still gets all grumpy when she sees me talking to him. What should I do?\n",

My gf keeps getting jealous when I talk with the guy even tho she knows that we haven't hung out outside of school for almost a year and didn't even try dating. We just kissed a few times. I wonder if I should cut him off?\n",

      "Title: Boyfriend m(35) and myself f(31) have been communicating about how to improve our sex life, dating for > 1 year\n",
      "Body text: I expressed I felt that it felt impersonal because it feels like it is a routine, and especially when he needs to finish it has to in a *very* specific position, down to every detail of even having his head over my left shoulder his head buried in the pillow. When I tried to have him switch his head over the other shoulder he couldn’t get back into it. When we had an open conversation, I asked why he felt it had to end this way. He responded with “I just have to get into the right head space, where I feel safe, I’m with my person and I don’t have any distractions”, while I don’t want him to feel anything less then safe and feel like he is with his person, it does feel very disconnecting that he can’t look at me and almost have a moment all about him rather then it connecting us closer. Asking a little further, seems like this has been consistent, as in he had to be in this position to get to his end to, further drove the point that this is not about connecting together through sex just simply needing to block out distractions “like your boobs”, to be able to get in the right headspace to cum. I just want to gain some other people’s perspective, advice or things we can try to help both of us. He wants to try but when we tried to have sex again without going into that position he wasn’t able to cum because he’s too in his head which I understand because of the situation above, but I just want to help this situation move forward because if we continue this I just feel like I’m the same routine he followed with his past partners and I’m more like a quick means to an end\n",

      "Title: My (M20) girlfriend (F25) and I have been together almost 2 years and she never initiates sex and would be happy having sex once a month.\n",
      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",
      "\n",
      "This disparity in our sexual desires discourages me because I’ve heard numerous stories about how sex frequency naturally declines as people age and relationships settle into a routine. Unfortunately, my situation is already at the very low end of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

      "Any advice is extremely appreciated. I don’t even know if I want advice as much as I just want to be heard or to be understood or related to. Sorry for the formatting I am on mobile.

      "\n",
      "So apologies for the long post but like the title says, my boyfriend’s ex keeps texting him randomly throughout the almost two years we’ve been together. They dated for two years then broke up, it was LDR and his longest relationship ever. Also his first “real” relationship. They broke up on not good terms and he’s mentioned to me he feels guilty on how things ended and some mistakes he made during their relationship. We started dating/seeing each other about 2-3 months after they broke up. We have had a few major fights about her throughout the duration of our relationship and then she got diagnosed with bipolar disorder last summer and he feels like he needs to respond when she texts him. Everything got more complicated. We are almost at 2 years together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first major fight was early on in our relationship when we were just “talking and casually dating”. She called him a few times in one weekend and he brushed it off so lightly saying he didn’t know why she was calling. Later on when I saw their messages he had told her a week or two prior he was open to catching up sometime. So not sure why he acted surprised she called. He didn’t tell her he was talking to someone new and his justification was he felt like it was mean to rub it in her face essentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time he accidentally posted a Snapchat story of us one night out and freaked out the next morning asking if I posted it…. Which I didn’t and he eventually apologized for accusing me. He said he had to delete it right away and he was freaking out because he didn’t want her to go all crazy on him since she didn’t know he was seeing someone new.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third time was a few months later I believe she called and texted again and I told him it made me feel uncomfortable. I asked him to let her know he’s seeing someone new and that she shouldn’t text or call just to “chat” and if it’s an emergency she can obviously reach out. He said he handled it. Later I saw the message he sent her and it basically said something along the lines of “hey I recently started seeing someone new and she doesn’t feel comfortable with me talking to you. So out of respect for her can you not call or text without any notice. Sorry” basically. We had been seeing each other for over 5 months at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth time we argued was over the fact that he would keep photos of her on his camera roll and it would occasionally pop up on this widget thing he has on his Home Screen. I asked him to remove it by putting them in either a drop box or shared album. Just away so it doesn’t need to keep popping up when we are together. He said he will and handled it. It kept popping up and I asked him if he actually did it or not. He said it’s too much work because there are so many photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth time he moved in with me and wanted to bring their cards and photos to my apartment because she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he was afraid something would happen to her since she was unwell. I said okay fine, please put it in something, seal it up, and into storage then. He agreed. I told him on one condition, when we move into our next lease together (his lease ended so he stayed with me for a few months until mine ended at the time) I don’t want it in our new home together. He can ship it to his parents house or put it in a storage locker. I don’t want to bring it into our new home together, and he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward, we move in together and he brought it with him. I even saw it when we were packing up to move and reminded him. He said obviously he’ll get rid of it don’t worry. He brought it in, I waited the first night when we unpacked and cleaned up to see if he would throw it away or something he didn’t. When I brought this up to him he said he wanted me to see him throw it away and he had just honestly forgotten about it. Whatever, we talked it out and maybe misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the other day she texts him, and he told me right away and kinda shrugged it off as a random dumb text. He didn’t seem to care to respond to it or at least that was the impression I got. It’s been for days since then and it’s been kinda in the back of my mind wondering if he responded. I feel like since he keeps responding even though it’s short, she keeps reaching out. Tonight at dinner, he got a text notification and immediately grabbed his phone at an angle so I couldn’t see the screen then put his phone in his pocket. I just immediately got a gut feeling it was her. I asked him did you ever respond. He said yeah then said “oh she actually just texted me back” and tries to show me. He texted her responding to her message after four days from her original text and said “blah blah blah happy Mother’s Day. Hope you and daughters name are doing well”. Then got upset at me and walked away. We got into a screaming match and he said I am so insecure about her for no reason and it’s ridiculous basically. I shouldn’t worry and that he just feels bad for her because she’s unwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it. She’s mentally ill but also like it’s not your problem anymore … she lives in a different state and has friends and family who care about her. You don’t need to be feeling bad and trying to talk her down. I just can’t shake that he’s okay with me feeling insecure (the “love of his life”) about it and upset that he seems to care more about her well being than how I feel about the situation. I’m not sure if I’m being too sensitive and should just deal with it because she’s mentally ill.\n",

We have had multiple convos about it every time she reaches out but seem to always get escalated and not resolved. I trust him and it’s not romantic. I know he feels bad for her and wants to be a good person but it’s a boundary for me.  Am I being too much and difficult for no reason.\n",

For the most part I agree and I told her that we will organize some double dates or some other activities where the girls will be invited. She was not happy and for some reason just wouldn’t let up. So last saturday I caved and she came to ufc night at mine. My other friends girl was busy that night, so she was the only girl there. other than greetings and small talk nobody really talked to her and she mostly just stuck to me. Fast forward 2 days and my friend told his girl that everyone found it awkward that she was there, and felt like they couIdn’t really act like themselves. I am sure that nobody said that, and he is just telling that to his girl so that she doesn’t want to come in the future. I know it sounds fucked but that guy is fucked in the way he treats/manipulates his girl. However now his girl told my girl and she really isnt happy. She thinks its extremely mean on my friends part to have even said that, and when i told her that nobody said that she just tells me that they obviously wouldnt tell me and that im wrong and they really all felt awkward because of her. Now shes saying she never wants to come again and she is really not happy. Personally i never wanted it to be like this but that is honestly exactly what I pictured happening and I really dont see why we can’t just have boys nights once in a while. Im trying to explain to her that since most of my friends are single, nobody wants to be THAT guy bringing his girl to the function and now suddenly nobody can be themselves anymore and its awkward… My friends don’t really know my girl like that so i can understand why her being there made it awkward for them. We have been dating for almost 4 years now and UFC has always just been for the boys. Am I wrong for wanting to have some nights that are just for the guys every once in a while?\n",

      "Body text: Hello, this might be a mess so i’m sorry in advance. I’m (21f) and i’m in a relationship with a (34m) who is in prison. It is my first relationship and I didn’t know it could be this painful. It started out really good and I was happy to finally have someone to talk to. I haven’t had friends for a long time, i’m not good at interacting with people but he made it easy. It started with only messaging but after about a month, he started to call me and it would then be every night. After, a few months of talking, I think? He tells me he loves me, it took me longer to say it but I truly feel it and have never felt this way about anybody else before.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I struggle with my mental health a lot and he has known this since the start. I started to take medication around a year ago because of how bad things were. He has never liked me being on them and doesn’t think I need them. One of the reasons why I stopped last year in December was because of that. I feel bad every day and when I try to talk about one of my biggest problems (DPDR) he confuses me because he makes me feel like it’s not real. I spoke to him about it not long ago and he says i’m not disconnected when i’m trying to tell him about it and got mad at me when I said he’s confusing me because it felt like he was saying there is nothing wrong with me. His tone changed and he sounded annoyed which made it hard for me to speak because I started to feel anxious which only made him even more frustrated. He has been through so much himself and still struggles, so I feel guilty when I get frustrated because he has experience and knows what he’s talking about.\n",

He told me he’s not speaking to me while i’m there and he hopes it was worth ruining our relationship but we did speak and he called me. I felt really bad after because he was upset and frustrated with me. He explained it all to me the first night we were there on the phone and said it’s because he knows what’s best for me. He knew I would be anxious because it’s a different place and all the people that would be around when we were out. I understood that and felt guilty that I didn’t have more trust in him because he was thinking about how it would affect me.\n",

      "Body text: As per the title, my boyfriend is watching porn and I don’t know how to talk to him about the issue. I’ve never brought the issue up before- I knew he sometimes watched it and was never a huge fan, but not enough to talk about it. Unfortunately, porn is so common in the modern age and he’s had a VERY sexually active life before me with a high sex drive, so I brushed it off. Lately though it’s been bothering me a lot. We live together and have been together for a few years now, I love him more than anything, so it’s not enough to tarnish my image of him or anything. But I’ve never had to have this talk with anyone before (especially because we never set this boundary; I’ve never told him I didn’t want him watching porn since I didn’t know it bothered me, and he’s brought it up without me asking him to not.) and I don’t know how to go about it. I think he might also have an OF account which I’m 100% not okay with, but I don’t have solid proof yet so I’m also planning on telling him that I think OF subscriptions are akin to cheating (which I know will make him immediately unsubscribe. He’s been cheated on and had his heart beyond shattered from it and is a genuinely good guy, so I don’t think he quite understands that subscribing to other women’s sexual content can be seen as cheating until I explain it to him). We’ve never had any fights before ever since both of us are the kind to immediately talk about any issues and we’re incredibly open and honest with each other, so I want to absolutely let him know before resentment builds or I accidentally snap and get grumpy. Advice and tips for this conversation are absolutely appreciated! \n",

      "Title: I (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) are in a very loving relationship, but I can't help feeling drained and sometimes a lot of quiet fatigue and anger at him. Is it something I need to fix within myself, or something we should change?\n",
      "Body text: I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for a few months, after a close friendship that turned into a relationship. He’s incredibly sweet. He cooks for me, takes care of me when I’m sick, planned a dream Valentine's day date, and genuinely tries to be a good partner. I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways, he really *shows up*. We've spilled our souls to each other and he knows about my past and my mental health and chronic illness struggles. I grew up with some very traumatic events in my childhood and destructive and abusive relationships at young ages, and he never shamed me or made me feel any less for it. It's all I wanted in someone and never thought I could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite all that, I’m starting to feel like I’m slowly disappearing in this relationship. He follows me everywhere, literally. In every social situation, at university, with friends, to my alone time. People now barely even know me outside of just expecting him to be there, and I feel like I’ve lost a lot of my identity and independence trying to accommodate him. It’s not that he’s controlling at all. He’s just… *there*. All the time. And emotionally very dependent on me. He’s also had a hard, traumatic past with bullying and doesn't have many close friends at all, and I so understand why he craves closeness, but I’m starting to feel like his emotional anchor, his mirror, and his support system, while barely holding myself together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve tried talking to him about needing space, and he *does* listen. But then the cycle repeats. I end up explaining myself over and over or becoming unwell just to be allowed to rest or have time alone. He gets slightly cold takes it personally even when he says he doesn’t. And the guilt is killing me, even when he says to me to not be guilty. Because I love that he always wants to be with me. That he tells me I'm always in his plans. And I know I'm young, we both are, though we've met each others' parents and are very seriously dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a growing disconnect in how we see the world. He has somewhat rigid ideas about his role \"as a man\": he insists on always paying for everything (despite us both being students), never letting me carry emotional weight, and acting like he has to suffer in silence to protect me. I know it comes from a caring place, but I want an equal in a partner. I tell him so often I want him to have a safe place in me and he says he does and that I don't have to go it alone either.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the same with how we think. We’re in the same science/medical degree, but I’m also very poetic, abstract, and creative. He jokes that it’s all “humanities nerd shit.” He’s very logical, very black-and-white in his thinking, and sometimes I feel like the parts of me that matter most (my voice, my way of seeing, the soft and strange language I live in) just don’t land with him. He’s not cruel. He’s not homophobic (I'm bisexual, he just doesn't know this) I don’t feel unsafe, I just feel subtly unseen. I find myself toning down my queerness, my language, my culture (he's White and i'm South Asian), my softness around him, just to make the air more breathable. And after a while, that’s exhausting. He says I don't seem \"overly sensitive like all those people\", but I've always been very tender-hearted and empathetic, it's like I've been dulling it around him like I do with the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him. He’s kind. He treats me so well, with so much care. But I feel like I’m suffocating. I really don’t want to break up or take space from him, I believe in nuance, and growing and changing. But I don’t want to lose myself either. I've noticed a decrease in my desire to spend time with him (sometimes even dreading it) or to cuddle or be physically intimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I handle this? I've communicated with him as nicely as possible for taking my own time off or making separate plans, and sometimes when he's joked about things or said things that I find upsetting (not maliciously, we both like our dark humour), I've let myself express that I don't want to. I've noticed a lot of my friendships fade, being simultaneously so happy and light with how he treats me and then heavy and crying my guts out.

I didn’t end things, but I was clear that I wouldn't feel comfortable being around these guys or with her spending time with them. At the same time, I told her I wasn’t going to try to control who she sees. I’m not her parent.

      "Body text: TLDR: \\~5 months into our \\~10 month relationship my gf (first serious relationship) was forced to live with me for 3.5 months before my roommates ended the arrangement and she had to move into her car and I moved into my parents' place. How should we proceed with our relationship? \\[full context below\\]\n",

      "As the title says I have been with my beautiful girlfriend for \\~10 months, \\*and this is my first serious relationship\\*. We instantly hit it off and were very happy together. Around 5 months in, I let her stay at my place (with my two best friend roommates) to recover from an emergency appendectomy that had complications (she is emancipated and does not interact with her abusive family, and she said her few friends are all married and didn't have the capacity to allow her to live with them). I work from home so it was easy to keep an eye on her. Her education job placed her on administrative leave and she claimed she left her apartment key in her office when she left for the hospital, in a locked space that she said was inaccessible while she was on leave. So she was stuck with me, and this continued for around 2 months until she said she lost the rights to her apartment, which was temporarily granted to her as part of a victim protection program by the DA. So she was stuck living me, with her job refusing to pay her for her time off while she was in recovery (this was valid, her doctors were all excusing her from work but her job refused to pay her). My roommates were not comfortable with her staying there for so long, but I defended her stating I love her and that she had nowhere to go and I was happy to support her recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "My roommates never warmed up to this situation. I understood their pov but this still frustrated me and my girlfriend because we always made an effort to minimize her footprint at the place; they were the messy ones and my gf would often clean up after them. These are friends I've had since I was young and I implored them to extend their love for me to her. But after around 3.5 months total of this, my roommates decided they wanted to move out because they didn't like the arrangement. They didn't want me to live with them if my girlfriend would still be with me, so they got a new place together and I moved in with my parents, and my girlfriend moved into her car. She has now been in her car for around 2 months since we moved out and it has been extremely difficult; she was still dealing with some lingering effects from her surgery and had also fractured her foot a few weeks before we moved out. She has been paying for her insurance and car payments and phone bills and all that without having any income, so her savings is beginning to run dry. She has only just recently returned to work but doesn't have the money to start renting her own place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other kicker: my parents knew she was recovering at my place for a few weeks but I did not tell them she stayed with me for all those months until it was almost time for us to move out. I was afraid to tell them because they are older and highly traditional and wouldn't approve of her staying with me. I see this was a mistake and I should have stood by my decision, because now my parents strongly dislike her and feel like she was manipulating me. They have not handled it well and have on more than one occasion borderline verbally abused her, even while I was with her in the hospital for something, and they have caused her a huge amount of stress. While I'm staying at home my parents are always in my business and trying to control where I go and what I do with my spare time, when really I'm just trying to comfort my hurting gf that I love a lot while she is stuck in her car, and it has negatively impacted my relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I am stuck living in my stressful home because I can't find an available friend to move in with; rent in SoCal is expensive and I don't want want to pay $2k/mo for a one bedroom (I can afford it, this would be around 32% of my monthly income, I just strongly prefer to save $$ with a roommate(s)). My gf and I love each other a lot and she is pushing me to get a place for us together, with a rent split based on our income. I love her a lot but I am afraid to move in with a partner in this kind of rushed way; it's been under a year and I never envisioned moving in with a partner to \"solve a problem\" like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "My gf is great, she is working her ass off still trying to finish college while working in her education job and dealing with her medical issues and she loves me a lot, she just comes from difficult circumstances with no family support and having to take care of herself since she was 15. She has helped people in the past that were in similar situations as her, and she would do the same for me, so it's been difficult for us to process the fact that I'm not ready for this step. Despite the stress we were happy together while she was living with me. It definitely fcks with me that my parents are so judgmental of the situation and I don't want to damage my relationship with them further by moving out with her without their approval, but at the same time I'm 26 and should make my own decisions. I am doing my best to assess the strength of our relationship while pushing aside this situation and my parents' and friends' disapproval because they don't know her nearly as well as I do, but it's all fallen on me and it's been hard to navigate myself. My gf is bitter towards my parents for treating her the way they have and she doesn't understand why I'd continue to subject myself to them by living here. There are certain things about her I'm not super crazy about; I think she likes to spend money on trinkets and food and some clothes when she should be saving to improve her position in life (we've always known I'm more of a saver she is more of a spender). But for the most part she is amazing and drop dead beautiful and smart and caring and we have a lot of fun together. She loves me and supports me and appreciates me and wants us to grow together as people and explore life and hobbies together; she'd love for me to marry her but I am scared of these types of feelings with her being my first serious gf and us only dating 10 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I resolve this situation to appease both my gf and my parents? Or are there reasons you think I'd be better off cutting it off? I'm trying to get them to sit down with each other to hash it out, but I don't know how much it'd help, and my gf is still kinda scarred by how they have treated her. I can edit this with more relevant info if it is requested.\n",

      "Title: How should I navigate dramatic differences in music and TV tastes, to preserve an otherwise strong, loving, and supportive relationship?\n",
      "Body text: I am 50 years old, divorced, and about three months into a new relationship with a widow (45 years old, female).  We love each other madly and have a lot of fun together.  She's beautiful, sexy, and has a fiery energy that crackles, along with a devilishly clever sense of humor that makes me laugh my proverbial ass off.  She's also very nurturing and a great cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have two passions (\"hobbies\") that don't mesh with her at all. I'm a major music maven, with a strong interest in cinema and \"premium TV\".  You could call me a \"hipster\" in both respects.  My girlfriend is much more conventional in her own tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With music, I'm kind of like the main character in the movie High Fidelity. I have a huge and carefully curated collection of thousands of songs and albums from across the past 70 years or so, and I'm constantly seeking out more, whether it's undiscovered gems from the Fifties or brand new indie tracks, and everything in between. I'm not squarely against Top 40 stuff on principle (I enjoy the Beatles, Stones, etc., along with Eighties synth-pop and even Taylor Swift) but I don't like most of it.  The lion's share of my favorites, especially my 21st century faves, are less well-known acts like the Decemberists, Father John Misty, and cleopatrick.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend will often say that she likes music \"as much as the next person\", but finds it weird and offputting to be SO damned \"obsessive\" about it.  For my part, I hate most of the music she listens to--mostly modern country and Nineties R&B pop.  I also find myself gritting my teeth at her habit (which, again, I think is very common) of flipping around from song to song right in the middle (I find this way too abrupt and would prefer either letting the song get to the end before changing it, or at least fading it out). Then there's the way she cranks up songs she loves (usually roadhouse/redneck style country) to where the car stereo can't really handle it and it sounds very distorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for TV and cinema: I belong to online groups and subscribe to podcasts devoted to independent and foreign films, along with ones oriented around \"premium TV\".  (For anyone not familiar with that latter term, this started back in the day with The Sopranos, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad; more recently, it's been Succession, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Adolescence, stuff like that.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I, again, am keenly aware that my way of watching TV is not the norm. And I don't only mean my tastes, but even more that back when we all watched \"linear TV\", I never just turned on the TV and flipped through channels.  Instead, I used the TV guide to determine in advance what I was going to watch. Nowadays, similarly, I never open a streaming service and scroll through to see what they are offering me. I always go immediately to the search bar and enter in the name of the show or movie I have decided to check out based on those online groups and podcasts (or, if I have already seen at least one episode, I go to my list and select it).\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend's preferred way to use the TV is to stream an endless procession of YouTube channels, mostly of YouTubers who prepare meals for the homeless. (I watch YouTube hardly at all, and when I do it's not \"channels\".) I find this content fairly excruciating.  I don't tell her that, mind you, unless she directly asks me whether I like it.  But her deceased husband also apparently hated her YouTube channels, so she does try on her own initiative to tear herself away from that stuff at times and use actual streaming services (I get the impression that she rarely does this when I'm not around).\n",
      "\n",
      "But even then, she just wants to see what the Netflix or Hulu algorithm serves up as suggestions, watch a preview/trailer (I don't like doing this because it spoils the show or movie--again, I know I'm weird that way), and \"pick something that looks good\". She doesn't seem to have much interest in going back to anything and following a series, more just watching random movies that pop up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to say I want to spend some evenings at my own home watching TV or listening to music without her, I guarantee she would be hurt and offended by this. I would have to have some other more \"important\" activity lined up to get by with this, but I don't want to lie to her.  I have suggested that maybe sometimes I should just listen to my music on earbuds while we snuggle and she can watch her YouTube creators, but she objects that this would be \"isolating\".  What can I do to bridge this gap and keep an otherwise very desirable relationship going?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My girlfriend and I are extremely incompatible as concerns TV, movies, and music; but I love her a lot and want to make the relationship work. At the same time, I can't handle the idea of just permanently giving up on these things that have been a central feature of my life for decades now.\n",

      "Title: My girlfriend (F19) and I (M21) are part of different religions. Her parents haven’t known about me for a year, but they just found out.\n",
      "Body text: So my girlfriend and I have been dating for one year now. She comes from a Muslim family and I come from a Catholic family. Her parents are more strict than my mom about religion. We both don’t practice our religion really except for my girlfriends, she pretends in front of her parents. I don’t think either of us would convert but we are serious about each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "She has two brothers, both who are dating out of their religion, but it’s different for guys. In Islam, guys can marry outside of their religion but woman can’t. Her oldest brother got a girl pregnant who is Christian and her parents basically forced them to get married. Her other brother is dating a Catholic girl. They found out about her some time ago but he pretended to break up with her and now just lies about the whole thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lives with all her brothers, her parents, her sister in law and her two nieces. Everyone knows about me except her parents.

      "\n",
      "That’s our whole situation. We’ve talked about this before and we agreed that if her parents ask her to break up with me, she won’t. We’re both serious about this relationship so far so I need help deciding how we’re going to deal with this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think telling her parents the truth would be the easiest way of explaining, but we’re not sure how that would turn out. A while ago, her oldest brother was arguing with his parents about how they rushed their wedding. His wife was upset and his mom ended up apologizing to her daughter in law. My girlfriend’s brother told his mom that the only thing he wanted was that she wouldn’t do this with his siblings and that she should be more open. His mom said that she won’t and that she would want them to be happy. I don’t know if she was serious or not, but that’s what was the last conversation about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure if we should downplay it or tell them everything. I think if we tell them we haven’t been dating that long, they’ll be more inclined to think it’s not a big deal for us to end it. So i’m not sure that’s a good idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her brothers aren’t helping much, so far the only things they’ve recommended was to ride it out and to pretend i’m her gay friend, which I believe the latter could work tbh. \n",

      "\n",
      "Examples of things he's said that give me serious pause about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to retire in 5 years\" - When I told him I don't want to be with someone who retires young (my father did, ended up sitting on the couch drinking beer/watching tv until my mother divorced him) he got very defensive, said he wants to start his own company, or just take an easier job (which he has in the past, multiple times), and \"who do I think he is\" (to be fair, I've not been working the past year while he has consistently been employed and successful since teen years). \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just have this job, for now\" - When I introduced him to my parents/friends he downplays his job to the extreme, says he does 'boring stuff with computers'....He makes 400k/year doing difficult programming for a famous company. He'll say things like he may want to do something completely different in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care how I look\" - His clothing choices are.... suspect at best. None of it is dirty, but he has lots of corporate t-shirts, sweatpants, and other such things. Some of his socks have holes in them. I want him to put as much effort into how he looks for me as I put in for him, but he just tells me to throw out his shirts that I don't like. His hair is also unshaped typically. OTOH he is a very avid gym goer and probably has the best body of any man I've ever dated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe in hard work\" - I \\*want\\* a hard working partner. I know he works hard, as I see him but he continues to say that hard work isn't worth it, and to work smarter not harder. I want a hard wroking partner who will always make sure we have a safe and secure future....and with him it just doesn't feel that way\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure what to do.... He seems to get quite defensive when I bring up any of these issues, and I feel like I can't even talk to him about them because he makes \\*me\\* feel bad for even bringing them up. If he's not defensive he'll just brush them off in a dismissive way... like \"yeah, whatever\" type of thing\n",

We have started living together in February and things have been going great, obviously an augment every now and then. Anyways i recently started to do minor petty things in our relationship when he pisses me off Example - we got into an argument the night before, i told him not to come to bed and sleep downstairs (i locked the master bedroom door) Anyways we were baby sitting my brothers puppy and in the morning i hopped up to let her to do business after an hour I forced him to wake up by putting the puppy on him while he was sleeping, this did not work so I jumped into spare bed and cuddled him until he woke up then obviously he proceeded to ignore me when he woke up.

      "Body text: I (22 NB) and my partner (32 Male) have been dating for around 4 months now. He was the first to ask me out and I decided to give it a shot because I hadn't been in a real relationship before and figured if it didn't work out I would just go back to normal since I don't have the mentality that I need one to complete me. Recently my partner casually dropped in passing that he sees us as lifelong partners and the prospect scares me a little. There's nothing wrong with him and I don't see any red flags I just wasn't expecting it and it still feels too early for me to tell if that's what I want. I get the general sense that he is looking for a life partner, someone to be with until he dies but I don't know if I want the same thing. Especially considering we're both at different life stages and I don't feel like I've figured myself out in terms of my own independence and dont want to completely rely on him if things go south. I'm not saying I don't like him, he's lovely so far and I don't see reasons to end things. I just feel anxious at the idea of \"forever\" and don't know if I just need more time to adjust or if I should find out what the root of these feelings are. \n",

      "Body text: my bf(19M) and I have sex relatively early in our relationship (he have been in a relationship for 4 months or a little less) , he was the one i completely felt safe and an urge from deep inside myself that i wanted to have sex with him, even tho i have been involved with other people i have never felt the urge to get naked around someone so when it happened i just let it happen. now it has become a constant thing in out life. it happens every. single. time. we hang out, sometimes i’m not even in the mood or feeling like it however i just want to make him as happy as he makes me. I just don’t know if that is normal in early relationships or if i’m just a pleasure tool. He does do everything to me, flowers, fancy dinners 3 times a week, and shower me in gifts, however always at the end he takes off my clothes. is he using me only for sexual pleasure?\n",

      "Body text: I love my bf and he’s a great person. I just don’t find him physically attractive and it’s mainly his face, which is not his fault. He can’t change his face unless he gets plastic surgeries and obviously I don’t want him to get surgeries just because of me.\n",

      "I had my son, “Aiden,” when I was 17. His mom left our hometown a few months after he was born and never really came back. It’s basically always been just the two of us. I was a kid trying to raise a kid, and I made a ton of mistakes, but I did my best and he turned out great. He’s smart, funny, sarcastic in that teenage way, and way more emotionally mature than I ever was at his age.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Aiden was 10, I met my now-husband, “Mark.” Things moved kind of fast, but I was careful about how I introduced him. I didn’t want Aiden to feel like I was replacing anything. Over the years they’ve been... fine. Not super close, but not at odds either. Mark’s been respectful of boundaries and never tried to play “dad.” He’s just been around, helping out, showing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months ago, after years of talking about it, Mark and I had a baby through surrogacy. Our daughter, “Ellie,” was born in December. She’s amazing. I don’t even have the words. And Mark—he’s glowing. I’ve never seen him this happy. I’m happy, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aiden’s been… not okay. He’s quiet. Distant. Not rude, not lashing out, just... not there in the way he used to be. He spends more time in his room. Says he’s “fine” when I ask. Doesn’t really engage with the baby. He used to come hang out with me while I cooked or watch dumb movies with me late at night—now I barely see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I get it. I do. He had me to himself his whole life. Now suddenly there’s a crying baby, and I’m tired all the time, and I spend most of my energy juggling diapers and bottles and making sure Mark gets some sleep before work. It’s chaos. And I think somewhere in all of that, Aiden started feeling like an afterthought. I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong, exactly, but I think I haven’t done enough right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a small argument the other night—something dumb about him leaving dishes in the sink—and he kind of exploded. Not yelling, but he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your way soon. You have your real family now.” And that gutted me.\n",

He said he didn't have any (we were at work hooking up in his car ) and he insisted it would be fine, he would only put it in for one stroke and I eventually agreed but it just ended up with us fully sleeping together. Then we hooked up 2 more times again all unprotected. My ex just told me today that he may have had something for some time now and the last time we had sex was recent. He told me he wasn't sleeping with anyone else and we were together for 4 years so I slept with him unprotected as well as I trusted him and was under the impression we were only sleeping together even though we were broken up.

      "Whilst for him, he already had more relationship in his past (such as gf/flirt/sexfriends/or just a 1 night thing) with a bodycount up to more than 16 from what he and his friends told me. So what he got with me, he already experienced it with some others persons from his past. And that wasn’t a problem for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2024, I accidentally found in his Reddit likes some women’s naked pictures. At first I was just trying to look for the topic he went through to find some interesting movie because this is how we always search some movies for our chill night. But when I saw all of these, knowing that these women’s was completely different from me was a shock because he knew that in my past relationship I preserved myself sexually with that person, which lead to the point that my ex once compared me to an porn actress and deeply made me feel insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he knew already that this kind of things happening to me is not what I would appreciate him to do. At first I thought that the distance would have been the reason of his actions about that, but I thought that this reason wasn’t really worthy in this situation because he had some pictures and videos of us already from when we were meeting and the dates was corresponding around the days we were physically together. So I was really confused about this and we had a long argument about this until he said that he done this because he “needed something different”.\n",
      "\n",
      "So obviously I was deeply disappointed because in my mind he wouldn’t be this kind of person knowing that story about my ex and me and my body that I gave to him but he told me that a lot of guys do that in their relationship and there is no problem (unless his friends said that when they are in a relationship they don’t do that) he apologised a lot about it ect…\n",
      "\n",
      "But a bit later (probably 2w later) we were talking about our past relationship and he asked me to see my ex because he never saw a picture of him, so by that I ask the same to him about his ex and we both saw, that he liked 2 relevant pictures of her on her account (she was showing he nipples out of her shirt) a few days later after our first time saying that we loved each other (back to the 10th February 2024). Again we had a big argument for days, he told me he wasn’t too sure about why he done that and that he was just trying to annoy her back then and that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all of that happening I have been feeling insecure for months, we are really open about talking our feelings out, so he knows everything about it and try his best to make me feel pretty and seen by him which I appreciate but recently I feel like that he’s been distant around me because of video games (I know it’s completely different but all of this story before is linked with why I’m not too sure if he just got into a routine or he finds me boring)\n",
      "\n",
      "So my bf and i both work, he works about 9hrs a day/3 times every weeks or 4 times sometimes. Our schedule doesn’t align that much, i often got shift in the morning when he’s off or at night, he only works in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing now is that, whenever he’s at home, he only plays his games, we don’t hang out together as lovely date anymore, or he doesn’t surprise me anymore. Even in the cleaning or cooking at home, I feel like he doesn’t try to put the effort like me into doing it anymore because I always do it. He only stays on his computer for the whole day or sometimes after work he comes back home after 7:30pm, eat, go to sleep for a bit, wake up at 10pm and play his game until 5am and go to work if he’s working the next day or just sleep and do that again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He let me fall asleep alone every night, sometimes I try to stay up until he go to bed but he doesn’t really care even if I ask him to come with me. On the sexual side, if I don’t try to put him in the mood, he doesn’t touch me to lead me into it (we use to make love at least 2/3 times a week now it’s only 1 time a week or every 2 weeks).\n",

      "About the wedding he’s not planning or helping me to plan anything, yesterday my friends came over and tried to help me because they were thinking that I must have been stressing on my own and didn’t wanted to let me down on that. He came back from work, eat the food I cooked for him and went to sleep until 10pm and went on his games. I know he’s providing the money for the wedding but I wish he could support me in all of that as my husband. I tried to tell him last night but he said “I came back from work and fell asleep, when I woke up everything was done how can I help?” And I just chose to stop talking about it and let him play his games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that for him being in a different country is hard and playing his games is a way for him to think of something different and to relax after a day with people speaking a different language but I feel like he’s bored with me too and try to escape all the responsibilities of our relationship. I told him multiples time that I was feeling like he doesn’t care of me as much as he used to do and it was scaring me because I don’t want our relationship to be a routine, I know that he is a homebody person so the past 2 months I made the effort of just doing the things he likes so no more visiting cities around like we used to so he can just chill at home around me but I realised that I am not happy this way and feel extremely guilty for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also about our sexual life, I feel like there is no more excitement for him with me and I started wondering if it was because of my body or maybe I wasn’t taking care of myself enough for him but when I ask him he tells me that I am pretty and he’s lucky to have me.

      "Body text: so me and my angel of a boyfriend connected naturally and have been flourishing all these past months. We have crossed so so many hurdles we never thought we would, lot of bad days, ample of good days but for the past 1.5 month something is just not feeling right. We fight/argue almost everyday, actually 6/7 days in a week goes by arguing which ends up ruining the other one's mood because of which rest of the day goes like a shit and sometimes is carried to the next day as well, though neither of us address this, but we do notice. Its not like the spark has faded away or we don't love each other, I could die for him and I still love him so very much and I know the same goes for him as well. We both really want to be stable and have the peace we both deserve from each other. When he tells me about his other friends being in a relationship where they dont argue and live a peaceful life, I get hella jealous and feel bad that I am not able to make this relationship work now. I have a very vibrant chirpy personality, I talk alot and would instantly light up a dead room. I wanted someone who would make me bath with love every second, who would love me like the air he breathes, which he was but off lately, its not like he doesn't love me, but I would say, he became someone like me, who would show tantrums over stupid issues, who would reply in an offensive way, as if I wasn't enough to be doing that and he should've been the one who would make me calm. But thats not the case, we both have been arguing over stupid things with no one knowing how to amend the shit and we just know how to counter each other. We both keep on asking each other back and forth throughout the day as to  what happened, to no avail.  \n",
      "One thing I would like to add as I consider this a really big factor: Since the beginning of our relationship, he has this friend group of some girls from which I was really insecure of, but with time I understood his relation with them and I am not insecure anymore. But all these months, Ive created so much fuss related to them, so much of drama caused by them, that there exists this knot between us because of external people existing between us. YEAAH, I agree there exists a lot of influence of third parties between us, sometimes I got jealous of him going out with them, I on the other hand hardly hangout with guys. But this issue has been resolved as I no longer seek him to amend a distance from his girlies and ive understood.  \n",

      "Body text: Background: I (40M) am in a relationship for the last 18 months with my gf (30F). I’ve been doing app deliveries for the last few months because we’re struggling financially to make some extra cash after work and on weekends. My gf has prior concerns because I tried to be friends with my x-wife and the gf wanted me to establish additional boundaries. I eventually did and believe she was right. Complicated tale, like all failed marriages, and I don’t want to get into it here. She was right. Even if friendly I was providing too much support in communication. And our boundaries needed to be more stringent, even if just because it made my gf uncomfortable. But she overall has trust issues as well. We are living together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation: I got back from doing deliveries , parked in our and apt parking garage, and wanted additional moment to myself. I put on an ASMR video, popped on my AirPods, leaned back the seat, and dozed off. She called me and the call woke me up because I hadn’t responded to some texts. I was flustered. I knew she wanted to hang out when I got back. We share location. She probably saw me sitting there. And I was planning to leave in a little over an hour to hang out with friends tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lied. I said I was on a call with a guy from work. In truth I had talked to him earlier while delivering, via text on my Apple Play (I swear I was safe doing deliveries). But I recounted briefly that conversation as though I was on the phone with him. I was clearly startled. So probably sounded like I was caught red handed. I felt like I had been. I feel guilty taking time to myself sometimes. It’s a personal thing. Not her. I work on it in therapy. I get embarrassed about listening to ASMR. I don’t know why. I just do.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this led me to lie instinctively. I got back upstairs and she asked to see my phone. Checked. Saw I didn’t call the guy from work. Asked what was up. I instantly came clean. She said she was upset I lied so quickly and so easily. I broke her trust. I suspect she thinks I was hiding something more serious. Or something else. I feel awful. I don’t know what to do. We’ve had other problems in the past. But usually can resolve it. How should I go about handling this situation?\n",

      "TL;DR: my girlfriend caught me lying when I fell asleep in my car taking a moment of zen. She says I broke her trust and is pretty upset. \n",

      "Body text: My (F31) boyfriend (M34) at this point have been together for 6 years. During the 4 year mark however a new woman got hired at his workplace and began hitting on him. At first, he told me all about it and even made fun of her for being persistent even after he said no and made it clear he was in a relationship.\n",
      "This went on for about 2 weeks where after, he completely stopped bringing her up at all. So of course i asked him about it, to which he brushed off each time. This got me curious, and i know what i did was wrong but i snooped through his phone and found them chatting.

      "\n",
      "On my end, i can see why he felt attracted to her and that was because she complimented him quite a bit and noticed little things about him, which i at that point didn't really do. After numerous talks he's noted the following:\n",

      "•They only chatted for a month before breaking it off before it got any more serious\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while now, and he constantly tells me that I’m “hot.” While I appreciate the compliments, they always feel centered around my body and come off as sexual.

      "We studied at the same campus, so we spend our time together a lot. In the first few months of our relationship, we meet in the evening after class almost every day to sometimes play sports together, or go out somewhere or just chill and watch movies in the campus. Then every night we’d be on the phone to chitchat until one of us fall asleep.\n",

      "But recently he’s been picking up games again. We still spend time together a lot. He’d still invite me to our evening meet-ups, and we still call each other every night.

At first I was being the understanding girlfriend and said it’s okay, but I’ve been falling asleep waiting for him to finish waaay more often now.\n",

      "He sometimes would check if I’m mad at him for playing games more often now. But I’m generally not very good at expressing what I want lol. I’d tell him “i don’t wanna stop you from doing things that you love”. I really mean that, but he has to know when to stop playing. Like, I don’t mind if he play video games more, but can’t he stop around the time I usually fall asleep? This is what I feel inside but I’m embarrassed to ask him this. I don’t wanna interrupt him mid-game and ask him to stop. I want HIM to stop playing because “oh, she’s about to fall asleep so if I don’t stop now, we’d not talk for the whole night”.

Plus I can’t really lash out at him for not spending time with me, because he DOES spend his time with me. I just miss our daily nighttime chats.

But then I’d feel terrible too if he stop playing completely because of me. AGHH WHY AM I SO COMPLICATED??? I’ve never feel so conflicted before.

      "Body text: My wife \\[33F\\] and I \\[35M\\] have 3 kids (ages 1,7,9) and are on a single income in a Low to Medium cost of living city. I work full-time and she's a SAHM. My wife quit her job shortly after our first child was born. She's always insisted on \"separate\" finances so we don't have joint bank accounts, credit cards, etc. She's a 100% beneficiary on all our savings and retirements accounts and we file taxes jointly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After taxes, mortgage, car payments, bills, after school programs, HSA and Roth, we're left with about $3500 per month. I send my wife $1500 for personal use, groceries, and most of the kids' expenses like clothes, snacks, school supplies. Out of the remaining $2000, I send $500 to my elderly parents, and usually spend the rest on miscellaneous expenses, vacations, or large purchases or invest it. I handle all the household finances and bills, and she manages her own CC bills. I've offered to \"combine\" our finances with full transparency, but she prefers the privacy and autonomy as is. Also she's also not very organized with finances, whereas I keep detailed budgets and spreadsheets.\n",

      "This has been our arrangement for several years. It was working well, until recently. She's hinting that she's always short on money and unable to pay her CC bills. She hasn't asked for me to send her more money per month, but she's starting to demand I send her half of any extra money that comes in, like our tax refund ($2000) and my quarterly bonus ($5000). She also pressured me into giving sister a large wedding gift. I told her I'll gladly contribute, but not all of it. I asked her if she had any savings and she got upset and called me stingy. We do have money tied up in investments and crypto, but I would rather not sell unless we absolutely have to.\n",

How should we improve our financial relationship and ease some of the tension?\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. At the beginning of our relationship she moved in early due to problems with her roommates. After moving in she rarely helped with house work. At the beginning this was excused due to her working more. However, when the roles swapped and I started working more than her, her workload around the house didn't change. Now she works around 18 hours a week plus university and I work 28 hours a week plus university. She might help out around the house 1 day of the week but she doesn't cook so if I don't feel like cooking, we waste money on takeout. She doesn't do the dishes because the water is yucky and doesn't take the bin out because it smells. She only does the washing when she runs out of clothes but I run out of clothes before her so I am constantly doing it. She leaves her clothes out on the floor as well as her makeup. She has a car but doesn't drive so if she wants to go somewhere I end up getting dragged along and because she doesn't drive I am the one constantly doing the shopping. Around once every two weeks she makes a comment about feeling bad about how she isn't helping out around the house and she will start helping but she never does. On top of this, when we moved house, I packed up 90% of the house. Moved it all except for the large items which I needed help to carry. I unpacked 90% of it. We needed to get a new lounge so I was tasked with it because no one responds to her on market place and when I hadn't she would constantly get upset at me but not do anything about it herself. When we have to contact the real estate it is my job to do so because my name is first on the lease but at the previous property where her name was first, it was still my job. \n",

      "One her closest friends was her ex-boyfriend who told me before we got together that he was still in love with her and would do what ever it took to get her back. When i talked to her about him she said he was just a friend and didn't want to cut him off even after he admitted he still had feelings for her whilst we were dating. After about six months of being together and me making my wishes about him know, she finally stopped talking to him. Since moving from our home town she has not made an effort to meet up with friends who live near us as well as the new friends she has made since moving here, whilst saying how she has no friends here and is lonely sitting at home all day. Her out of town friends that come to visit us are constantly making jokes at the expense of me and my family and I have made it know that i don't want to be around these people but she wants me to come to her friends events because they are her friends and they need to like me. On top of these friends, her family is also making jokes at the expense of me but according to her its just how the show there love. Recently we have been making visits to she her family and due to the distance, I have put in time off for a day each week because I have to drive. So ill drive her the 3 hours each way for a day trip, or drop her off and let her spend the night and then after an 8 hour shift drive the 3 hours each way to pick her up. \n",

      "A ongoing issue in out relationship has been our intimacy. At the beginning we would be intimate once a day or more but as time went on I gradually pulled back, initially it was because I couldn't keep up. When she told be this, she said i should go on testosterone or get a pill. Now we are intimate 1-2 times a week because I am very conscious about the fact that I'm not ready to be a father and she would keep the child if she got pregnant. I would be comfortable with eliminating sex but she isn't so I cut back. I have told her my reasoning and she is always saying she is on birth control and she needs more. Due to this she has been very pushy about this topic and is guilting me into it by saying i am not fulfilling her needs so we are having intimacy even when I don't want it.\n",

      "This week, she got very upset that I didn't put in the time off to see my mother for her birthday. My mother lives 3 hours away in the town that we both grew up in. We haven't been back in a few months so my GF hasn't been able to meet up with her friends and family that live there. She yelled at me because I didn't put this time off and went on to say that my mother is going to get mad at her because they talk more than I talk to my mother. It has to be noted that I don't particular like my mother as she tried to paint my father as the bad guy after their divorce and has cause my sister and father not to be on speaking turns. My father on the other hand has never said anything bad about my mother and even stops us from saying anything bad about her. She knows this but is still trying to force me to have a relationship with my mother but my girlfriend doesn't have a relationship with her mother. \n",

      "Body text: For context, we are both in our junior year of HS and have been dating for around 3 months now. Sometimes when we talk about our future, it seems she has her life/career completely laid out for the next 10 years, planning to work in an extremely high paying job. She's very hardworking and talented too. I grew up in a middle class family with a working father and stay at home mother, and I always admired my dad for supporting us and wanting to do that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, I have a deep fear of not being the \"breadwinner\" in the future and being the one being provided for. I hate it. It's not that I'm intimidated by her potential successful career, but I've always looked forward to having someone rely on me and being able to buy things for my partner. It gives me value and makes me happy because I made her happy, so not being the one to do that crushes me. I also don't have any other redeeming qualities. I can't seem to stop myself from overthinking about it because I don't even know what I'm feeling, and it clouds my mind every day. Am I thinking too far ahead? What am I supposed to tell her? Why can't I just be happy for her?? I'm aware that I have no control over what she wants to do or how much money she'll make and she's not even doing anything wrong but every time I talk to her that's all I think about now. I really like her and everything else is perfectly fine, so I would rather not break things off cause of my childish fears.\n",

But im getting really mixed feelings about this because i have brought it up a few times and wanted to know why, but she always says its because her whatsapp or instagram is glitching and because shes always on do not disturb, personally i find it hard to believe because when she was on a school trip where phones were prohibited, her whatsapp didnt glitch and showed when she finally went offline and whenever we go out, sometimes i take a glance and her phone isnt on DnD. I hope im not overthinking or insecure, its jus that im very conflicted in what im seeing and would like more opinions on this!\n",

It is difficult for me to ask outright for sex and I find talking about it pretty uncomfortable, but I absolutely love having sex with my bf. This excites me because of how much I resented and avoided sex with my husband; I thought I was asexual and I grieved that. \n",

      "I know I’m fat. I’ve gained a lot of weight over the years due to a medical condition. Exercise, eating healthy, all of it doesn’t matter as due to this medical condition, the weight is impossible to lose. I’ve had doctors even tell me I’d have near an impossible time losing weight.\n",

      "I’ve spent years hating myself because of my body. I’ve struggled with ED disorders because of it. I’ve missed out on experiences because I didn’t want people to “see me”.

Thanks to her I've traveled more than I ever have and have moved into a bigger home with her. We share the same values, sense of humor and interests, and it's just crazy just how much she matches with me in terms of what we like to do. \n",

      "I currently work as a physician assistant in Ortho so I make a good chunk of the finances which I'm perfectly fine doing. She has a stay at home job that she does as well as pick up shifts from a hotel or fancy restaurant serving people to get some extra money. We have a decent balance in terms of finances and she definitely pulls her own weight in contributing to the monthly payment and making sure there's always food at home. She always makes sure there's dinner at the end of the day and really goes out of her way to make sure we have healthy meals throughout the day. Not that she's obligated, but she even sometimes makes me breakfast and usually makes us dinner. Also while I'm away at work she makes sure the house is clean and does our laundry. \n",

She's always struggled with being comfortable driving on the highway and also has a hard time motivating herself to go to the gym (shes been making an effort but usually comes with me as motivation). We recently went on a trip with her family and her mom and sister mentioned that she's always been kind of lazy. I had a talk with her in the car and she said she was really bothered by it and is trying her best to better herself but just struggles. I asked what long term goals she had and she couldn't really bring one up besides starting a family one day and continuing to support me. She otherwise doesn't have many hobbies but this doesn't really bother me too much as I enjoy us spending time watching Netflix together or playing video games. \n",

She values me, cares for me, and makes sure that I know I'm loved. It's almost everything I could've asked for but still wonder if I'm potentially ignoring something that shouldn't be ignored.

      "Body text: For context, I’m 22 and currently living with my parents. I moved back in a couple of years ago for medical reasons, and while I’m now in a position to move out, it’s a process that takes time and planning. I’m working on it with a potential roommate, but I’m not in a rush since my parents are okay with me staying for now.\n",

      "I also don’t have a car at the moment because I can’t afford one yet. My new job will allow me to save up for one, but in the meantime, my boyfriend has been giving me rides. He offered to do so, and I always assumed it was okay, but clearly, it’s become a source of resentment for him. I fully understand how giving me rides could feel burdensome. It’s time-consuming and inconvenient, and he’s under no obligation to do it. If this was his way of setting a boundary, I would have respected that. But instead, it came out in a way that felt more like shaming than communicating a need.\n",

      "On a Wednesday when we were both off work, he picked me up so we could go work out together. We’d been texting throughout the day, and everything seemed fine. But when he picked me up, he was clearly upset. When I asked what was wrong, he started bringing up how I needed to get my life together. He began by saying he was tired of giving me rides and wished I could just drive myself. I completely get that frustration, and I was ready to have a calm conversation about it. But then he started getting more heated, saying things like how I’m lazy and how he’s tired of being my “taxi.”\n",

He’s explicitly told me he doesn’t want to live together, so it felt unnecessary and unfair to attack me for something that isn’t even his concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I tried to explain that I was aware of these issues and actively working on them, but he wasn’t listening. I asked him to calm down because it was starting to feel less like a conversation and more like an attack. That only seemed to make him angrier. He began yelling over me, interrupting me every time I tried to speak, and eventually told me that I was a burden and that he wasn’t happy with me. He said he didn’t want to be with me and that he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. It was a complete escalation from where the conversation had started, and I was left feeling blindsided and hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t speak for a few days, and during that time, I was left feeling completely confused and rejected. On Saturday, he asked me to come over, and I thought we’d have a proper conversation about what happened. Instead, as soon as I walked in, he started crying, hugging me, and trying to initiate sex. I told him I wasn’t ready to be intimate until we talked things through, but since there were other people around, we agreed to wait until the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, we went to a museum and finally talked. He said he felt overwhelmed by how much he thinks I rely on him and that he felt like he was carrying the weight of my responsibilities. I can understand feeling that way regarding the car situation. It’s a lot to always be the one driving and adjusting his schedule to accommodate me, and that’s valid. But he also made it sound like my entire existence was weighing him down, which felt like he was placing blame on me for things I can’t immediately fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel like I treat him as a father figure or that I rely on him more than a typical partner would. But the way he expressed it made me feel like he sees me as a dependent child rather than an equal. I’ve taken steps to address what he brought up, but I’m still struggling with how he communicated it, how quickly things escalated, and how extreme his reactions were. I don’t know how to navigate his expectations without feeling invalidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend and I had a major argument that almost ended our relationship. It started when he told me he felt overwhelmed and said I was a burden to him. He brought up feeling frustrated about giving me rides since I don’t have a car yet and criticized me for still living with my parents, even though he’s the one who offered to drive me and my living situation doesn’t directly affect him. The conversation escalated quickly he started yelling, calling me names, and said he wasn’t happy or attracted to me anymore. We didn’t talk for a few days, then he asked me to come over, immediately got emotional, and tried to initiate sex before we’d even talked things through. The next day, we finally discussed it, and he said he felt like I relied on him too much, almost like a child. I understand how the car situation could feel burdensome, but I feel like he took it way too far and expressed himself in a really hurtful way. Now, I’m trying to figure out how to address his concerns without feeling invalidated or belittled.\n",

      "I'm currently facing a very difficult time as my BF (32M ) of 5 years cheated on me (F26) and i found out about it back in 2022. He apologized and accepted his mistake and begged me to stay even though I told him that it would be impossible for me to trust him again but he asked for another chance and said I will make you trust me again i will change myself you will see. \n",

And in that fear, i have been holding onto him so tightly that i think i might have suffocated him. \n",

I havent developed any healthy outlet or way to self regulate myself. Im working on it now. I do become better for sometime but whenever the feeling of him being slightly distant starts to creep in, my mind goes straight to the what ifs. what if he is giving time to someone else thats why he is being unavailable and distant to me? what if he is talking to another girl? what if he leaves me for someone else? all these questions then lead me to ask him all sorts of questions and i make him swear that he is not lying. I realize now how hard it must be for him to deal with all this given his attachment style. he withdraws. I push him. the argument get bigger and worst. He flips that why cant you give me space when I need it. Then I beg him to come back, we talk things out and then the same painful cycle repeats. \n",

      "Title: I (30M) am struggling to respect or admire my girlfriend (29F) after learning more about her lifestyle and past — is this incompatibility or me being too rigid?\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been seeing my girlfriend for about six months. At first, I was really drawn to her energy — she’s warm, open, emotionally expressive, and genuinely kind-hearted. She was incredibly accepting of my past and showed me a level of patience and nonjudgment that I deeply respected. I wanted to build something meaningful together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But over time, I started to feel a quiet internal tension that kept growing. About three months in, she opened up about parts of her past she had initially lied about — her drug use, her drinking habits, the lifestyle she lived up until shortly before we met. It wasn’t just experimentation in her early twenties — it was part of her recent life. And while she told me she’d stopped since being with me, I couldn’t stop feeling conflicted about it. What also bothered me was how she often spoke about being drunk or high in a lighthearted, almost glorified way — like telling funny stories about blacking out or doing cocaine. It made it seem like these weren’t just mistakes she learned from, but part of a lifestyle she still identified with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also struggled to find things I genuinely admire about her in terms of growth or achievement. She doesn’t seem driven or motivated, doesn’t work hard, doesn’t cook, and is often late. She values “fun” but not the work or structure that makes it sustainable. When we talk, most of her stories revolve around partying or being high. I don’t think I’ve ever heard her talk about a goal or project she’s working toward.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often drinks with the explicit intention of getting drunk, and she’s blacked out more times than I’m comfortable with. She’s gotten hurt, made poor choices, and still tells those stories with pride or amusement. We recently went to a party together, and being around that scene with her and her friends—the drugs, the partying—it just pushed me over the edge emotionally. I left feeling like I didn’t even like who she was anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I value discipline, structure, accountability, and growth. I’ve worked hard to become someone I can respect — and I’m looking for a partner whose values and lifestyle align with that. I know no one is perfect (including me), and I don’t expect anyone to come without a past. But what I’ve realized is that it’s not just the past itself that bothers me — it’s how close it still feels to the present, and how much I still see it shaping her identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her as a person, or whether I was initially more in love with the idea of her — the version she presented early on, before these truths came to light. The more I sat with it, the more it felt like I was mentally and emotionally carrying a mismatch — trying to bridge the gap between my values and hers, between what I hope for in a long-term partner and what I’m actually experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe people can and do change. But I’ve also learned that for me, admiration and shared principles are foundational. When those start to erode, so does my emotional connection. And I’ve started to wonder if I’m trying to force compatibility where it just doesn’t exist. Since then, I’ve been struggling internally. I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her, or whether I’m just clinging to the hope that she’ll eventually become the person I thought she was. I’ve started feeling emotionally disconnected, and even a bit resentful. I also wonder whether I’m being too rigid or idealistic but I can’t shake the discomfort. Should I break it off if I don’t feel that I can respect her?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I’ve been dating someone who initially lied about their past with drug use. Her past (and recent) choices around drugs and partying conflict with who I thought she was and drug use was a dealbreaker for me. I’m torn between wanting to be accepting, and feeling like I’m losing respect and admiration in the process. Unsure if I’m being too rigid, or if this is just an honest incompatibility.\n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone! I’m F20 and my Boyfriend is M20; we met on vrchat (nobody make fun of this, please) and met up 3 months into our relationship and things have been going great ever since! We’re now past the 2 year mark and I absolutely adore him. We live about 2 and a half hours from each other at the moment and tend to see each other at least for a week each month; he even went on a vacation to California with my family and I this past winter! Though since he left in early January, I haven’t seen him. My parents keep telling me in order to see him, I need to clean my depression room. (I have a new bedroom now. But my old one is still…a mess. 4+ years worth of clutter and clothes) and I physically cannot clean it without him. The only time it was ever even clean is when he helped me; but after my family figured out he helped, they banned him from going inside the room. Currently going on 4 months without seeing him and it’s really getting to me. I’m autistic and he is genuinely my comfort person. I’m in dire need to see him and they just won’t allow it. I feel so stuck. He missed my birthday, missed some pretty important life events of mine, all because I can’t clean the damn room. Any help, tips, or just advice is overall appreciated. Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day :))\n",

      "Body text: This is something I’ve struggled with a decent bit, but I don’t know how to fix it. Me and my girlfriend got together our senior year of high school. We are long distance now, going to different colleges, and things are going great. The thing that eats away at me though is that I am not her first. During her junior year, she dated another man for a couple weeks where she experienced most of her firsts other than things like PIV sex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since learning about that, I have felt extraordinarily jealous. I am not upset with her, but extremely envious of the experiences that her ex got to experience with her. I am jealous that her best kiss, her best date, her best sexual experiences will all be held with him. I know that she hates him immensely and he treated her extremely badly, yet it still eats away at me that *he* was the one to hold all of those amazing experiences with her back when they were exciting and special. \n",

      "Title: I (18M) love my girlfriend (19F), but I’m struggling with her weight gain and don’t know how to talk to her about it anymore\n",
      "Body text: Hi Reddit,\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend (we’re both 19 now and about 160cm tall). I’ve loved her deeply all this time, and I still do. But I’m at a point where I’m feeling conflicted, frustrated, and unsure how to handle things.\n",
      "When we started dating, she weighed around 58kg (~128lbs), and I was totally fine with that. I’ve never been someone obsessed with looks. But over the years, she’s gained a lot of weight — now she’s about 86kg (~190lbs). I’m not trying to fat-shame her, and I understand that bodies change, but this is starting to affect her health. She’s experiencing knee pain and struggles with things like getting up or moving around easily.\n",
      "She’s been doing what looks like intense workouts (4 times a week) for about 1 year, and from what I can tell, she’s really trying. But despite that, she keeps gaining weight. Every time I try to bring it up — gently, I swear — she gets really upset. Last time, I mentioned that maybe she could try eating just a little less, and she broke down crying and called me an asshole. She said I could never understand what it's like because I’m naturally thin (I weigh 45kg and actually struggle with gaining weight myself).\n",
      "She’s seeing a nutritionist, and she says she’s eating normally and not starving herself. But to be honest, I don’t know how to make sense of it — because if she were truly burning more calories than she consumes, she shouldn’t be gaining weight, right? I’ve tried to explain this without sounding cruel, but it always ends with her in tears or calling me an idiot who just doesn’t understand.\n",
      "So here’s the truth: I feel guilty because I still love her, but I’m also less and less physically attracted to her. Sometimes when I see her undress, I feel kind of grossed out, and that makes me feel like a horrible person. We still have regular sex, and it hasn’t affected that part of our relationship — yet. But I’m worried that over time, this lack of attraction will become a bigger issue.\n",
      "Am I a bad person for feeling this way? For having physical preferences? For being honest — even gently — about my concerns for her health and our relationship?\n",
      "I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t talk to her about this without making her feel terrible, no matter how carefully I try. And I don’t want to hurt her — I just want to be honest and find a solution together.\n",

      "Body text: My partner (M20) broke some shocking news yesterday, and very openly expressed how he struggles with watching porn. We have been together 2 years. He shared this has always been a struggle of his especially before us. He wishes they could stop, and finds himself in a cycle of shame every time.

      "Title: My [37M] Wife [36F] Wants Me to Leave Because I Keep Avoiding Hard Conversations\n",
      "Body text: My wife and I have had a rocky marriage for the last 16 years, mainly because of some situations I have caused. We started dating at 18, and both of us come from broken homes and we got married at 21 and had our daughter not long after getting married. Throughout our marriage, I have had issues with planning long term, dealing with impulsivity and avoiding difficult conversations. My wife has given me grace, and given me chances to fix things which I have tried to do, but usually have not met her complete requirements to which she then makes concessions for me. It has also always been really important to my wife that we move out of our hometown, and it is something that we have planned to do since we got together, but has always fallen through usually because of my lack of planning or effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my work is relocating us cross country in a few months, and I have let plans fall behind. We also have my daughter going away to school for the first time in a few months, and the perfect storm of big events that require planning is causing us to need to have some really important conversations which I keep avoiding. I know that these conversations will ultimately lead to fights over money and how good we are doing, my lack of financial planning, etc. Now, she wants me to leave the house because I have kept pushing them out so far, and all I want to do now is to just have them. Get it all out and have the conversations so we can either move forward together, or apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue now is she doesn't even want to talk to me about those things, she just wants me out. I don't know what to do anymore. I really want to work it out with my wife, I want her to move with me and I really want to make her feel fulfilled, but even if I can get her to have the conversation with me now, I feel like I will just end up disappointing her with the outcome and causing an even bigger more volatile fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also been struggling as I have been in counseling the last few months, and recently got diagnosed with ADHD. Through talking with my counselor and researching, it really seems like a lot of my relationship issues are common with ADHD, and that is throwing me emotionally. I haven't gotten effective medication yet, and I don't want to use this to excuse everything, but it's just hard to deal with.\n",

      "**TLDR: I have a history of not planning long term, and that has caused my wife stress and she now wants me to leave because I am avoiding hard conversations about our plans to move cross country. I know I need to have these talks now, and I want to, but she just says it's too late. How can I approach this?**\n",

      "We’re both night owls, but she stays up later than I do despite working earlier. I have a sleep disorder, suffer from frequent nightmares resulting in poor sleep and am a light sleeper. She’s a heavy sleeper. So I’m woken up and then bothered roughly every 5-8 minutes by alarms due to the convo of snoozed ones and new ones going off. Usually I end up being the one to finally get her to wake up. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been years of this and I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve talked with her about it and she just says that it’s hard for her to wake up and it’s not like I have to be up until later as if my poor sleep doesn’t affect the rest of my day. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve considered sleeping in a different room but that upsets her and frankly I don’t think I should have to move bedrooms to get better sleep. I doubt she’d wear a smart watch so I don’t think a vibrating alarm will work. Moving her alarm across the room won’t do anything as the alarms don’t wake her up, only me.

      "My husband and I love each other very much but he has always been way more affectionate than me.

I see his point and I understand where he is coming from, but after I put our baby to bed, all I want to do is just relax and have some fun (watch TV, browse on my phone, play game, etc). At that point, I’ve been affectionate with our baby all day long, I don’t have any more room for affection.

      "Title: Husband said “why did I ever marry you” out of nowhere…\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "I (23F) have been married to my husband (27M) for a little over two years, together for 5 overall. When we got married, he knew I was bisexual and had shared my past experience (only 1) with a girl. For reference, it didn’t go past the kissing stage, and our time together was veryyy brief (about 2/3 weeks). I shared this part of me to my husband BEFORE we got married, and knew it was something that made him uncomfortable but he still accepted me and loved me for who I was. Or so I thought. Over time, he has randomly brought it up in random situations, which I never found “bad” in a way since I was just like ok whatever he is just being annoying, but since we would never fight or argue about it, I didn’t see it as a problem when he did bring it up. I have had one serious conversation with him about this topic with him and let him know that I love him and that i chose to marry HIM. that I would never cheat on him, and if i ever did, it would probably be with a guy, not a girl. I also made it clear to him that if he could not accept me for who I am, we should not be together. I accept him for all his faults and defects (even though being anything but heterosexual isn’t a fault or defect) and God knows he isn’t perfect. I’ve forgiven him for looking at other girls a few times on his cellphone, and watching 🌽 when we had already said we wouldn’t do that in our relationship. I know the two situations aren’t comparable, but I brought it for the sake of argument. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, here’s the issue. Last night, we were having dinner while watching Friends on tv, and mind you, ever since we started watching that show together (he’s never seen it) he makes little comments out him turning out like Ross (who plays a divorced character becaUse his wife left him for a woman). I always ignore it or tell him to stop, but since he says it in such a lighthearted way, I never felt the need to argue or say much, as whenever this does happen, I usually will be like “babe stop, i love U” and that’s usually the end of that conversation. He doesn’t do it in a mean way but I can tell he is frustrated by my sexuality. lol. Ok, back to the story, A scene came up with Ross and his ex-wife (with her new wife) and he randomly looked at me with so much disgust and frustration and yelled “why did i marry you!!??” with his hands in the air in a frustrated form. I looked at him and was like wt??? and said “what?” I was genuinely confused cause like ???? We weren’t even having a conversation or anything, we were literally in the middle of dinner watching tv. I quickly caught on to what he was referring to in terms of his statement, and I instantly felt like shit. I told him he f’d up, and to not talk to me, and got up and went into our bedroom and cried. lol. He has said f’d up shit in the past but it’s usually during an argument after i’ve been a B**** for a while, but this hurt. It hurt more than it would have if it would have been said during and arguement. But no, he said it when we were peacefully having dinner. He looked so disgusted and frustrated at me when he said those words. Anyways, he followed me into our bedroom and started saying how if he knew I was bi before we got married (which he did) he wouldn’t have married me because he wouldn’t want to have people making fun of him for me being with a woman after us divorcing (him assuming that i would immediately get with a woman if we ever separated) I told him that if we ever did divorce, he should not care what I do after him. He spends his time saying how he doesn’t care about others opinions, so why does he suddenly care in that situation? It’s more like this hits his ego and makes him insecure I suspect. I let him know that i’m happy to accompany him to get a divorce if he isn’t able to accept me for who I truly am, and that if he is able to accept me, he needs to drop the subject and let it go, i am with him, not with anyone else. He should be focused on our marriage and not what I would or wouldn’t do in a hypothetical divorce. I told him he’s an id**t and that he is ruining our marriage by doing stuff like this, and said a few more things but quickly just told him to leave me alone, and that I did not want to speak to him for the moment. He said a few words but I honestly didn’t care to hear them and turned my back and fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t find him in our bed but sleeping on our couch. Which he has never done before in our 3 years of living together. I guess I just need advice on how to proceed. He is a great person and husband, he is very loving and kind, and is a very open minded person and is accepting of everyone’s sexuality (except mines i guess) but his words hurt me more than anything else he’s ever done or said in the past, and I don’t know if I can get over that. I feel so sad. He really hurt me. I don’t know how to move forward. This morning we barely spoke and neither of us said I love you before heading out. Advice? \n",

Last night, out of nowhere during dinner, he looked at me with frustration and yelled, \"Why did I ever marry you?\" It hurt deeply because it wasn’t in the heat of an argument—it was random and cruel. He later told me that if he had fully processed my bisexuality before marriage, he wouldn’t have married me, because he doesn’t want people to make fun of him if we divorce and I end up with a woman. I told him that he either needs to accept me as I am or we should split, and I went to bed upset. He slept on the couch, which he's never done before.

      "Title: My alcoholic bf of 9 years slept through my entire birthday and our plans\n",
      "Body text: As the title reads. I don’t have anyone who can relate to my situation so I’m posting it here. Im 33F and my bf is 36M. We have no kids but have 2 dogs and own a home together. I also have to add that currently he is NOT working and in between jobs atm. My birthday was 3 days ago and I’m STILL crying as we speak and so hurt by it, ugh. I’m not even big on birthdays, but considering how insanely busy my schedule has been for the past year (I’m a FT trade student, FT online student for my bachelor’s, and work 4 nights a week . I literally have no days off), I just wanted ONE day off work to relax and spend time with him. I thought the day we had planned was simple-I was going to my Saturday morning class and leaving by 11AM so we could go on a walk with our dogs and later go get ramen for dinner. In addition to this, I also asked if he could do the dishes that had been piled in the sink…Did any of that happen? Absolutely not, and I can’t believe I fooled myself to believe it would. \n",
      "\n",
      "This relationship was the best I’ve ever had in terms of our connection. It has felt so effortless and right until a few years ago where his alcohol problem started to quickly affect everything in our lives. Yes it’s a huge problem, he has lost every job he’s had due to attendance issues, it has bled into our relationship, and his promises with family or friends always end up with him flaking because he’s too hungover or want to stay home to get drunk. It’s like he knows he has a problem but doesn’t care enough at all to change it until shit hits the fan. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been with one foot the door for a while which he has been completely aware of but I always let shit go because I don’t like holding grudges and I love him, but now I’m starting to see the big picture and how little he values me. This time it IS different and as much as I want to get over it, I just can’t let this one go. I can’t keep fooling myself to believe things will one day change when they’ve been faulty for years. Up until my birthday, I had no idea that was the last straw. The one day I was really excited for and even rescheduled with my parents was ruined because he decided to sleep all day until 5pm. He was also vomiting like crazy when he woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not saying I’m an angel, I have a tendency to say hurtful things when I’m upset and I’ve had my issues with alcohol (not even close to his extent) but I recognize when I’m fucking up and do my best to check myself. I just feel so hopeless now. I really thought I would be with this man for the rest of my life, but the fogginess is starting to clear up and I’m almost desperate at this point to get out. I’m tired of being an after thought along with our two dogs that HE wanted to adopt, but can’t even be bothered to walk them unless I bug him. He’s not the man I used to know and alcohol has consumed him. I reached out this his parents a few years ago, and they something similar to an intervention and he was actually doing good for a while, but sometimes old habits never die.  \n",

      "This is already super long. I just never thought I would be that woman in her mid thirties that has to start all over again. I really wanted kids, but I just don’t see that happening with him and let’s be honest, my time is ticking. This is so unfair. I am now having to uproot my life and sell my dream home due to his repeated lack of effort. The birthday was just the cherry on top of all the issues I’ve brushed off for so long. As heartbroken as I am, I’m also eager for a new chapter. I deserve so much better and this relationship has dragged me down for too long. . I wish I could forgive him, but I just can’t keep playing myself. Deep down inside I don’t think he can change, and I can’t keep living like this. Please tell me I’m making the right decision to leave? \n",

I feel like he doesn't know how to draw boundaries with her and one day, if we get married, he will bankrupt the two of us and our family trying to help her. I initially thought this may be an overreaction but the more and more I see this happening, the more I believe that it is completely possible.

      "Title: My (22F) boyfriend (22M) keeps letting his friend (24M)  come on our dates.\n",
      "Body text: UPDATE: I broke up with my ex (I’m gonna call him X) I went to where we agreed to meet up, and guess who he brought with him…you guessed it LIAM! I was very annoyed at this point, I told him I wanted to speak with him privately, and he brings fucking Liam. It’s very uncomfortable to break up with someone in front of their best friend, but I was too pissed, I told him “I said I wanted to speak privately“ he said “say it in front of Liam” eventually I just get annoyed and say “thats it! I don’t want Liam always here in our private life, on dates, everywhere“\n",
      "\n",
      "he basically said, remember what I told you about Liams circumstance, blah blah blah. I said something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck about what Liams going through right now, this is about me breaking up with you” meanwhile Liam is just standing there…looking confused? I’ll get back to this later. So we basically get into a fight in this park, and it gets to the point where I tell him that he manipulates me into not kicking Liam out of our dates, and about everything he told me Liam went through (like a brother to X, saved X life, dead mom, dad absent, no siblings, friends, or girlfriend)\n",
      "\n",
      "and then X looks like he got caught or something, and Liam gets angry saying like, “what did you tell her” this is all really funny and really awful at the same time. It turns out…NONE OF WHAT X TOLD ME WAS TRUE. Liam has a fiancée, has a REAL brother and sister, and his mom isn’t dead! So, anyway, definitely broke up with X. Like, 40 minutes later, Liam DMs me basically saying that X told Liam that I wasent ”comfortable“ being alone with X, and that he thought I *wanted* him to be on the dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, what? he said the reason why he agreed is because his fiancée is living in Europe to finish up her study abroad program, and he had nothing better to do. So X just flat out is a liar, glad I broke up with him, mad I got lied to, but oh well. This was honestly not a turn of events I was expecting, and I have to get it out somewhere. END OF UPDATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "|||EDIT: I called my soon to be ex boyfriend to meet up, and I’m gonna break up with him, I’m gonna tell him the exact reason honestly. I swear if Liam is there though, like, I’m not considering the possibility of not breaking up with him. It’s not even just because of Liam, its that he manipulates me into letting Liam come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, how we got into this predicament in the first place, is that my boyfriend just really likes his friend (Liam) he’s like a brother to him, he saved his life once, etc. But he’s on ALL our dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even brought one of my single friends on a date (so we could double) and Liam and her don’t date, so that failed. I’ve honestly asked my BF “why Liam is on our dates“ and he says that Liam is, lonely, has nobody else, and he has NO SIBLINGS or girlfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "but then my boyfriend kind of guilts me because (I know this sounds awful) Liam is the fucking package for guilt! His Mom died when he was young, then his Dad and him don’t talk anymore, so Liam just doesn’t have anyone else to talk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly think my boyfriend is guilt tripping me, and I don’t think I can do this relationship anymore. If nothing changes I’m leaving, this has gone on for 3 months.\n",
      "\n",

      "Now we’re in therapy, and I thought it was working. The last few weeks he’s worked less and made time to hang out with me and our baby more. He’s planned outings for us, taken us for bike rides, been home to cook dinner and do chores, and to watch the baby/toddler so I can have some me time or some friend time. It’s been so nice, and I mentioned to him that it made me happy, and thanked him for doing all this and making progress like we’ve talked about in therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On our walk this morning (and in our last therapy session) he said it made him disappointed that I was so happy with spending all the time together. He said he noticed that since he didn’t spend so much time doing extra work (he’d normally work 60+h/week but cut it down to closer to 50h/week) and hanging out with us more at home that I’d been happier, and that it just proved to him that he was the problem. He said that everything he wants is a problem, and when he doesn’t do or get what he wants then I’m happy. He said he’s happy spending time with me and our baby, but he’s disappointed too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Idk what to even think of this. I’m just hurt that I’ve dedicated so much time and energy to this relationship, to raising our baby (who is absolutely incredible), and that I’ve been told I shouldn’t be asking more of him, and that when we do spend time together he might be happy in the moment, but seems to look ack at it with regret and disappointment. Idk if he’s even happy to be with me. It doesn’t feel like it. It feels like he sees our relationship as holding him back, but when I try to tell him this he just says it feels like I don’t trust him. He says that lack of trust makes him not want to try. I tell him I’m trying to trust him, but he keeps doing this same pattern of spending time with us and then pulling away and then the cycle repeats. I don’t want him to pull back away, I don’t want him to tell me I shouldn’t need him. That’s when I can start trusting him again. Right now i’m always waiting for him to stop engaging with me and to just always be away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He struggles a lot with negative self talk and negative self image, so I try not to say negative things when describing what I want out of our relationship, or how I’m hurt. But then he just puts words in my mouth, feels self pity, shuts down and stops talking to me for a day or more.\n",

We were all having fun, drunk walking home, you know like just the normal drunk stuff. It's seriously still blurry and I don't even remember how it started. I had three drinks plus some buzz balls and I was so wasted. I just remember being on the couch with my best friends wife and I was leaning into her. She started to rub my chest and so did he. The way we were sitting on the couch has was positioned where I was in the middle, friends wife was on my left and friend was on my right. I really don't remember what happened, I know I was laughing. I don't even remember if I kissed either of them first, I don't think I did? Next thing I know we're all kissing WITH TONGUE?!?! And after they they started making out like less then an inch away from my face still touching me. Last thing I remember was I was in their bathroom and I could hear them having sex?!? I woke up in their bed this morning and I seriously am so freaked out. Now that I'm typing this out I don't even know if I initiated anything???? I'm in the guest bedroom now, they haven't woken up yet and I'm so lost. What do you even say when this happens? Do i apologize? Should they apologize? How do you even go about bringing this up? \n",

I kissed them a couple times actually, which is. Something. They both seem to have not minded! Y'all were also right, they've been more friendly and open! Im still a bit besides myself and will probably just lock this away in my brain. I don't wanna think about the implications right now.\n",

      "Body text: My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been dating for about four months and I truly adore him. We've always communicated well and haven't had any serious conflicts, but lately, something strange has been happening when I share my boundaries with him. As we've gotten closer and told each other more about ourselves, I've mentioned specific things that I like and don't like (i.e. I don't like when someone eats off of my plate). All of these boundaries are things I haven't felt the need to mention/express because they just haven't come up/posed an issue for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem I'm having now is that it seems like my boyfriend is going out of his way to do the things that bother me? I gave the food example because it is the one that he is giving me the most trouble over. I struggled with disordered eating pretty badly in my teens and early twenties (thanks, anxiety) and it's only in recent years that I've started to eat \"normally.\" That being said, I still struggle with portioning my food without counting calories and generally just eating intuitively, which is why I don't like it when someone eats off of my plate. If you've never had an eating disorder this may seem totally silly, but as I'm learning to trust my ability to eyeball correct portions and balanced meals, it just really bothers me and throws me off if someone is taking random bites off of what I served myself. One day, I will grow past this, but I'm kind of embarrassed by it, which is part of why I hadn't mentioned it to my boyfriend. And it hadn't come up at all! We always just enjoyed our food when we ate together and that was that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I've mentioned this boundary, my boyfriend either insists on taking bites from my plate or tries to eat off of the same plate and insists that we share a glass to drink out of. Sometimes he'll even try to get us to share a fork and pass it back and forth as we eat, which I'm not interested in doing. Yesterday, I went to eat a cookie and he took it out of my hand as it was on the way to my mouth and told me \"you don't need to be eating this.\" (I am in good physical shape and eat healthy 80% of the time -- not sure what the issue is, lol). I told him he wasn't going to dictate what I eat, and he apologized and said he was just trying to look out for my health. When I've confronted him about the food sharing, he's told me that it's just who he is and that it's selfish not to share food. (Also want to add here: it's not like I'm serving myself a plate of food and telling him he can't have any. There's always plenty to serve himself, he just wants to share/eat off of what I've put on my plate).\n",

      "Can someone please tell me how I can resolve this? All the other aspects of our connection are lovely (so much so that I do want to work through this and not just break up) and I just want to know how I can effectively communicate that this boundary (and others) are important to me?

My friend came over and she tried to pet her and she hissed and swatted and meowed raged then ran away. My boyfriend says that he does not want our guests to be afraid of the cat.

So I let people know not to interact with her and keep their distance and Daphne does the same.\n",

Ive tried showing him some Jackson galaxy videos but he says that that is my own biased opinion that I am shoving on him and does not want to learn because he doesn't believe it. He says that if he had a dog that growled and swiped at him that he would rehome the dog cause he respects me. I say that dogs are so different than cats and he has to learn how cats work.\n",

      "Well he has been trying to get on her good side - only by feeding them wet food at night. Nothing else. He has not tried to play with her (she loves to play) he has not tried to give her space. He says that it is his home and he has a right to feel at peace in it. He doesn't want to tip toe around the cat. Which I agree. I am just at a loss now of what to do because I've tried to help the situation with positive reinforcement and learning videos but he is not wanting to put in the effort because he doesn't believe it will work.\n",

I just don't know what to do because it would break my heart to rehome her and I feel like I would always have this guilt and animosity towards my boyfriend after the fact if I had to do that. Which I just can't do. He says he can't believe that I would disrespect him like that and not accomodate him in his own house by getting rid of her. \n",

      "Title: My bf [25M] refuses to marry me [22F] until we’re in our 50’s. I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend now for little over a year. But we ‘dated’ for about a year before becoming official. As the years have passed obviously conversations have popped up such as: what are both our thoughts on having children? when might be the appropriate length of time to move in together? And finally: marriage. We are both in this relationship for the long run, neither of us have ever dated casually and were only looking for long term relationships when we met. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6 months ago, the topic of marriage got brought up for the first time. Not because either of us want to get married now, but because I hope to one day get married in the future (next 10 years). My bf responded by saying something along the lines of: “only when I’m in my 50’s or later”, I thought he was joking, I really believed he was pulling my leg, until he made it really clear that he was being deadly serious. I was a little upset, but I wanted to understand why. His reasoning for doing so was because: he didn’t want to conform to “societies norms”, he said too many people “play by the book” and he believes people should break that, that our love shouldn’t be defined by a legally binding contract and that after people marry it all goes down hill from there. I explained that I didn’t view marriage that way, that I viewed marriage as two people making eternal promises to one another and that making vows and sharing a day where we can celebrate our relationship is very important to me (and of course ever since I was a little girl I’ve always fantasised about the dress and the ring). He replied with “if it’s a day you want I’ll throw you a party, I’ll get you a ring so you can tell people we’re married, but I’m not getting married until late”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this conversation we have had the same discussion about 5 times over the last 6 months. I always end up burying my head in the sand and hoping that by the next time he has changed his opinion, even if it’s only a little. But nothing has changed and he is very set on his opinion. I’ve even spoken to my mother and stepfather about it, who themselves didn’t marry until they were both 55, and they say it’s “just an age thing, he’ll grow out of it in the next 5 years”. But I don’t know if I can see that happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he’s being so so stubborn about it being so late in life. He still says he wants to marry, just not until then. Other information I do feel is important to add is that his parents are divorced (so are mine), and divorced when he was 17, from what I know it was quite a turbulent split and his mother claims she left it later than she should’ve. Other than that our relationship is strong, arguments are rare and I’m very close with his family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do love him very dearly, and I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but this is something I’ve always wanted to fulfil in my life and something I believe is a very important aspect of a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of staying with him for the rest of my life and never getting married has crossed my mind, I don’t want to be bitter or resentful in 30 years time because he deprived me of being able to marry while I get to watch all of my friends and family get married. But the thought of leaving him to find someone who can give me these things and living without him is just as bitter. \n",

Pretty much all the same thing, some just a little more hurtful than the others, some really motivating. Overall after reading all the comments I feel small, like really small… and stupid. I don’t know how I’ll be able to reply without getting really upset so I guess this is my reply. I feel incredibly insecure and honestly too embarrassed to reply to a lot of the comments here. So to those who do just want the best outcome for me I really appreciate your heartfelt advice and time. Thanks to everyone for your input, I never expected to get so many comments. \n",

      "Title: My gf wants too much sex!!\n",
      "Body text: I 29 M have been dating my gf 26 F for about 7 months. Things are going good nothing that we cant work through, but there is a pretty big difference in our sex drive and home comfortability. First off, she has had problems with addiction before and still has a lot of addictive tendencies, so with sex she even admits those tendencies play a role in her wanting it all the time. And i mean ALL the time. I myself am plenty happy with once or twice a week and really making it worth while. I get at the beginning of a relationship, it’s like how many times can we do it in a day? But after the relationship settles in, that game never stopped. I honestly think she would have it 5, 10, 20, times a day if i could keep up. Id like to say im exaggerating but i honestly dont know. We’ve done it 5 tomes a day on multiple occasions before, (and honestly at a certain point im using toys and foreplay and its really just all about her getting off cuz im done for the week/month.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I like sex as much as the next guy but damn…. It isnt even special anymore. Sex is nothing to me now, i actually decline her advances for sex probably 3 times as much as i will initate sexual advances of my own. We’ve had ok talks about it and its thankfully not turned into a fight, just a casual admission that she has a very high sex drive. But thats not all, she also has spent nearly every day at my apartment and when she is home she immediately gets naked and stays naked. I know, what kind of bf complains about that, but over time its had a negative affect. Im completely used to her naked body now. It’s also not special to me anymore. I dont mean that im not attracted to her, she is absolutely beautiful but 90% of the time i spend with her she is naked, and im not. I like to wear comfy clothes when im just chilling at home, and it feels awkward when we spend most of our time here filly naked and me fully clothed. Ive tried to avoid saying anything that would sound judgemental or controlling because thats not how i wanna be and its also not accurate to what im feeling. She started noticing when ever we go out and she puts something nice on, that recently those arethe times  when ive been giving her compliments on how nice she looks. And she thinks im getting used to her naked body, and i replied with “well yeah, i see you naked 10 times more than i see you with anything else on, i kinda am used to it, but that doesnt mean i dont think your beautiful, And im complimenting your outfit because you picked it out and you look good in it.” She didnt say anything but i knew she didnt like that answer and theres this incompatibility building between us that i can feel a fight coming on soon. The more i thought about it tho she was right. Even when shes just wearing the occasional comfy clothes at home with her unkempt hair all about, i find her super attractive and i realize that im just over exposed to her naked body that anything different is actually just new and interesting, and our relationship is oversaturated with sex to the point where other than the few great romantic nights in particular i honestly dont care about having sex with her. Not like im not enjoying it, and finishing if you know what i mean, but i dont care to start it and its even a chore sometimes and i have been turning her down frequently, which also leads to her just playing with herself while i am trying to go to sleep instead, and it is very awkward and i am wide awake during. I never thought too much sex would actually be bad for our sex life, but here we are and i can feel this thing starting to become a problem and i have no idea how to talk to her about it. What the hell do i do? \n",

      "TL;DR: my gf has a sex problem and it is oversaturating our lovemaking to the point of losing its spark. \n",

      "Edit: Just want to summarize. Im not complaining about having sex 4-5 times a week, that does seem like a very healthy sex life for us, i personally am good with 2 times a week that go all out, but its much more than 5 times a week, and thats with me turning her down as well, and i must add that we rarely have quickies you guys. Not bragging but i work out, i run, i eat good, i take supplements, and i have good stamina, so our sex can last pretty long each time. also, shes on meds that can take a little more effort for her to climax, so im not being lazy here. It’s genuinely alot of work some weeks and sex shouldnt ever be work. \n",

      "Title: Boyfriend made me uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to handle this\n",
      "Body text: I (27F) am dating this guy (29M)—he puts in effort into me, great career, kind, we get along. The other day, we had a somewhat serious convo on the phone. I asked him what we were, and he was very hesitant on comitting and didn't want a label which tbh wasn't a great feeling... but I go over to his house anyways where he cooks me an amazing dinner from scratch, then afterwards we go to his room and he asks me what I would like to do. I pick movie, but he tries making moves on me and I say “I’m really not in the mood for anything physical.” He then asks why, I just state that I’m not feeling it I would just like to relax and watch movie. He doesn’t like this. He keeps asking why, if I’m upset, if something is bothering me, if the reason is because I am upset. He pins me down so he’s on top of me, and he starts cackling like he kept laughing while thrusting his hips against mine and pinning my arms down so I can’t move. He says that’s it’s too coincidental that I’m not in the mood the same day we had a somewhat heavy phone call, and he tells me he thinks there’s more to it than me just not being in the mood. I kept saying not in the mood and that’s it.. I then say “how would you know there’s more than that?”and then he got really close to my ear and whispered “because I know.” Super uncomfortable, but I’m still pinned and he got close to my other ear to whisper and then I yell. He backs off, and goes “woah there you freaked out on my for a second there, then laughed.” He says “someone is telling you to do this. Who? Let me see your phone, specifically the messages between you and your best friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was leaving, he then asks me if something is wrong in a calmer manner.. but then he said “you not wanting s*x is OK, and I was respectful and backed off.” But that’s not what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ghosted him because of how creeped out I was. Then 2 days later he sends me a 5 paragraph essay about he he cherishes me and wants me to be his girlfriend, and that he regretted not making me his girlfriend sooner. I say no, and we have a phone call where I tell him I don't want to date him because he pinned me down. He claimed that he didn't know that I was uncomfortable, and that he was just playing around and thought something was going on with me so he was just trying to figure out what was going on. He said he had a different experience and had no idea he made me uncomfortable and that he was respectful and didn't push things further. He said he really wasn't trying to have s*x with me and that I took his intentions the wrong way. He didn't apologize so I just hung up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he kept messaging me, asking for another call. He kept saying that he would hate to end what we have over a simple unintentional misunderstanding, that he cherishes me and only wants to treat me with kindness. I told him I'm not interested yet he keeps texting me asking to talk things through, saying that he had no idea that he made me uncomfortable and is sorry.\n",
      "Should I give this another chance??\n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have been together for a few years. He grew up in a safe environment compared to me where he had loving parents that took care of him. I grew up in an unstable household (poverty, abusive father, etc). This basically shaped my life as the eldest daughter who had to grow up fast. When I sought out my partner, I thought it was all green flags that he had such an amazing family and supportive environment. \n",

I am a person who has overcome significant hardship to get to where I am now (poverty, abuse, very difficult career field). I am also really good at dealing with things under pressure and I consider myself extremely resilient. On the other hand, I find myself comparing my experience to his and feeling resentful that he is so fragile at dealing with all this. I get that we both have very different upbringings.

I’ve been frustrated with it as there is little that I can do besides talk him through it. And the other issue is I find myself often in my “masculine” energy where I can’t really depend on him and that’s not something I want to be all the time. I want to be able to feel like I’m being taken cared of or at least that there is a balance. I need to reiterate that I don’t want to leave my man. I love him sincerely.

For context, her divorce was due to infidelity on her ex-husband’s part. Mine was due to alcoholism on my ex-husband’s part. It was just a coincidence that it was within a year of each other. This led to a lot of crying together and lot of healing together, and we re-entered the dating world around the same time. The next couple of years were full of a lot of fun and tough lessons about relationships and partnerships and dating and love. This was stuff we spoke about constantly and had learned a lot of great/important lessons. \n",
      "She met a boy and dated him for a year. He wasn’t the one, nobody loved him, but we let her work through it. Definitely had some serious conversations, but trusted her to make the right choice for herself. She does finally break up with him and is in a very peaceful place. Within a week she goes on first date with a new guy. A set up through mutual friends (38M). She felt like it was too soon, but also wanted to just get back out there. They’ve now been dating five weeks and are engaged, to be married to summer. In total, they will have been together approximately three months before they’re fully married. I’ve only met him once. He does seem by all accounts to be a good man.\n",
      "This just feels insanely fast and insanely irresponsible. They both have two children each from their prior marriages, ranging in ages 9 to 14. I genuinely don’t understand what the rush is. The only context I can provide is that they both leaned heavily into their Christian faith post divorce, and I think that maybe accelerating the timeline for different reasons? If you ask them, why they’re moving by so fast they will just say that they are in love. \n",
      "How do I strike a balance between honesty and tough love and support for my best friend? What do I say? Do?\n",

For one, I have 2 animals of my own and he has 2 large animals. The size difference already worries me a bit despite them getting along and being around each other here and then. The second thing, I am purchasing a home and he is expecting to move in. The thought has always floated around but I’ve never told him a hard no.

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for four years. I’m 32 and he’s 30. He was my first love—the first man I gave myself to emotionally and physically.

      "Body text: I(21M) had my mom pass away from cancer 7 years ago. My mom was diagnosed with cancer and moved to another country for her treatment, so my dad and mom were separated for about 5 years before she passed away. So it was during the duration where she was away that my dad had an affair. Now yesterday, my brother(28M) and I got a text from the person he had an affair with (I don't know the name or the age), with the picture of the daughter he had and how old she was, and it was my dad that had her send the text to both of us. He admitted that it was a mistake, but I don't know how far that I can trust that statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked from the fact that my dad had commited such an act of infidelity, since he looked like just a loving and caring husband. When my mom couldn't move much, he was the person that took her to the bathroom, gave showers, fed her, and was always beside her until her last moments on Earth. He was also a great father to me and my brother, and always had his top priority be his two sons.\n",

      "Title: MIL is pressuring us (34 M/F) to move in with her and it’s ruining my marriage\n",
      "Body text: UPDATE: A conversation last night pretty much confirmed my suspicion that he's planning to force a move when his mom visits next month. He has asked me to empty our storage unit before she arrives \"to prove to her that we are okay\" which makes zero sense. Then he dropped \"if we didn't have all the extra stuff we could just pack up and go try living with her and see what it's like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's my understanding that I can't get a court order to prevent him from taking the kids out of state and I'd only be able to file an emergency order to return them after they were taken if he attempted to establish residence with them elsewhere. It's either that or file for divorce and add a provision that he not be able to leave the state with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I texted MIL telling her clearly that we do NOT want to live with her and that I just want to be on the same page so she isn't prepping her house and getting her hopes up for no reason. She stopped talking to both my husband and I. She's been pretty communicative but no contact with either Of us all day which is weird since lately it's been daily. A lot of weird things are suddenly making sense, like her insisting she would take my kids when she visits so we can have a day alone, which would never happen because they don't even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am alerting the rest of their family in her area that she is doing this so if they do try to take the kids the rest of the family can be on the lookout for them and let me know where they are. I am close with his dad and stepmom who I haven't said anything to about this up to this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to remain firm and if he continues to push I will tell him I am filing for divorce if he continues this. I don't want to. He is a good man and we are very happy together and I want to believe in the face of losing me and potentially our kids he will come to his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you everyone for your thoughts and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR\n",
      "MIL was no/minimal contact for years and very suddenly after loss of the last family she had is pressuring us to move in with her with our two kids 1800 miles away from everything they have ever known. My husband wants to go and I do not. It’s ruining our relationship. What rights do I have if I do not want to move my family across the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief history. MIL and I had a good relationship until we moved out of state after 6 years. She cut contact with my Husband for many months and it took years for them to establish a relationship again. During that time we got married, had a baby, and she still refused contact with me because I \"took her baby\" from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was 4 years ago. She lost her brother a few months ago and he was the last of her family. She doesn't have familial relationships with anyone except a very distant relationship with her brother's 2 kids. This is by her doing. She has largely cut her other son out of her life because she doesn't like his new girlfriend and feels she is taking him from her (sounds familiar). So suddenly she is reaching very intensely out of the blue to establish a relationship with me and my daughter who she has had no contact with her entire life. Never sent a gift or a card or called to talk to her (she's 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she is saying she wants us to come live with her. We are 1800 miles apart. She wants us to live with her until we find work and a home near her. To me, it feels like she's grasping at the last shred of family she has left realizing that she has no one else. She is enchanting my husband with how magical this will be. She will babysit, buy all our food, cook for us, give us date nights whenever we want, we can live in her 10 acres and have lots of space for our two kids and our dogs. It all sounds great except.. we live here. Our jobs are here. Our life and all our kids have ever known is here. There is no reason to leave other than her suddenly deciding this is what needs to happen. She literally went from not talking to me for 4 years to texting me \"I love you\" every day and telling me how she's getting her house ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing a HUGE problem between my husband and I because he LOVES this idea but before this we were happy living where we are. We have goals and plans that are based here. One of our kids is in school here, I'm in college here, we have a good program here that allows anyone to get a free degree up to a bachelors. I can finish school without owing any money. There are many reasons I want to stay where we are. The same reasons we chose to live here in the first place. But now my husband is caving under this delusion of a beautiful carefree life with his mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to resolve this. I'm not moving my family across the country on a whim just because my MIL decided she's lonely and he's set that it would be great for our family. She is set to visit for the first time next month after saying for YEARS she would NEVER come here and previously said she would come up to help us move everything in with her. I kind of feel like they are planning to twist my arm when she is here and try to force moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I protect myself from this and also keep a good relationship with my husband? I don't even know what my legal rights are if he were to say we're moving and I don't want to.\n",

      "I need a perspective on what happened between me (36F) and my bf (38M) to understand whether I am in an abusive relationship. We have been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went for a trip planned some time ago. My bf loves taking care of planning the itinerary and I give him the opportunity with pleasure. He takes pride in being known for being a skillful organizer. He took care of the first two days and said he will arrange the rest on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bf has a problem with being chronically late and sleeping in. This annoys people at work and his friends complain as well.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have my fair share of issues, which I work on relentlessly through various therapies, self-help, meditation and being vulnerable by talking to friends who see through my bullshit. I was adamant about doing couples therapy in the early stages of the relationship, which we did for 3 months. I would usually be the one bringing up issues, he is always cool as a cucumber. He is conflict avoidant and prides himself on a rational, strategic approach to relationships. Therapist seemed to like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning after arrival to the first hotel his alarm started ringing, and as usual he would snooze it multiple times and cuddle with me instead. Finally I said that maybe it's better that we wake up to not lose the day. He opened his eyes and was visibly unhappy, asking why I didn't wake him up earlier. I said that this is his responsibility to wake up, and actually eventually I did wake him up anyways, so I don't see the issue. He was unhappy but we moved on with the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today the alarm rang and he started snoozing again. After two snoozes I say \"I am waking up and will take a shower, you should wake up too\". He said \"ok babe\", but stayed in bed. I go out of the shower and say \"Babe wake up\". He still procrastinates. Eventually he opens his eyes and is pissed because he realises hotel breakfast will only be served for 5 minutes longer. He attacks me asking why didn't I wake him up? I get really angry and say that, again, it's not my responsibility and wtf is this blame-shifting? He still complains about the situation and decides to still try and grab the breakfast. I say I'd rather eat on my own in a cafe later because I feel hurt, which after he returns to the hotel room, I do. I ask him to please pick me up from the cafe on his way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "While im in the cafe he texts me a screenshot of a map with a hiking trail. I don't reply and proceed with eating, but in 30min I decide to ask where is he. He says \"can you stop complicating things? I sent you the location\". I said that sending a screenshot is not direct communication and if he wants me to show up somewhere, he needs to say so. He says he is tired of this bullshit. I say that I feel hurt by the way he communicates. He proceeds by calling me immature,  sending memes making fun of me being emotional, and eventually threatens that he will go to the hike on his own. He starts countdown (!) over text. I say that I can't continue on this trip without talking the situation through first. Eventually he says that he is going without me. I decide to take the train back home and inform him, stating that I hope he can resolve this issue with a therapist. I say that I love him and wish him a happy stay, but he never answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now I was finding this relationship great, although he did show a dismissive side in the past. This is a first time when something of this magnitutde happened and I am a bit scared that there is something wrong with him. We recently started trying for a child. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have dated for a year and a few months, and I visit him at his apartment a lot whenever I have multiple off days from work. A couple months ago I walked into his closet and saw what looked to be a small makeup bag sitting on the top shelf. Admittedly, I had skimmed through his closet before so I knew this bag was something that had not always been there and most likely was placed there recently. Inside of the bag was multiple sample skin care products , which didn’t freak me out because my boyfriend gis into skincare so it’s not too far off for him to own that. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, what I also found was lipgloss that DEFINITELY did not belong to me. I calmly confronted him over it once he got home that day and he said that the bag was given to him from a friend and was all samples. I offered to take the lipgloss if it was truly an unopened sample seeing has he wasn’t going to use it and he told me that it probably was used. When I asked by who he said “ a girl he used to know” definitely didn’t believe that, but for my own mental health I dropped it. He’s also been so incredibly sweet and seemingly obsessed with me that I told myself he couldn’t possibly be hiding something from me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today, he is at work and I am alone in his apartment again. I snooped through his closet again and this time found a necklace which (you can guess) isn’t mine. I feel sick and I don’t know what to do. I know it’s wrong to go through his stuff but seeing as I literally found some other girls makeup in his closet I can’t say I don’t have decent reason to be untrusting of him right now. I plan on bringing this up when he gets home but I don’t know how to go about it because I know he’s just going to lie to me. How does one approach someone about this?\n",

      "\n",
      "TL; DR - My (46F) BF (49M) has a decades-long friendship with a woman friend (47F) who has been unpleasant towards me and who isn't interested in getting to know me. They went out to dinner alone, and I didn't like what he reported back about how it went. We discussed how to handle it; I wasn't comfortable with the resolution until yesterday when we clarified some things. It turns out he had already taken many steps to distance himself from her and is fully committed to making sure all of his friends treat me respectfully.\n",

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I had a long chat with BF yesterday. I am feeling fine now. I had made some incorrect assumptions and misunderstood a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1 - He had already resolved to refuse any one-on-one invites from her. At the end of our last discussion, he'd said he wasn't sure what he would say to her. I thought that meant he wasn't sure if he would turn her down or not. He actually just meant he wasn't sure how he would phrase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 - I assumed they were in closer touch over text than is true. After the dinner last year, I told him that I'd prefer him not to go out with her alone but that I didn't expect him to completely end the friendship and that remaining in contact was fine as long as it was appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he had not initiated a single text to her since their dinner last year after I expressed concern. She has texted him maybe 5 times in the past year, all very benign and appropriate, like \"Happy birthday\" or \"I heard your uncle passed away; condolences.\" He responded to each with polite but very short messages \"Thank you. Hope you're well.\" No phone calls or other forms of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that they'd been slightly drifting apart before we met anyway, so he decided to steer things in the direction of drifting even further out of contact since it was creating an issue for us. He was prepared to be more confrontational if she got inappropriate again but was happy to find that it wasn't necessary. As mentioned in the original post, they have many many overlapping friend and family links so it would be preferable not to have a dramatic rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - I assumed they were bumping into each other at group events with some frequency. It turns out she hasn't been able to attend any of the same events that he has. The last time they actually saw each other was in fact that dinner last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that I was avoiding asking for details about how often they were in contact as a way to cope with my discomfort without being too controlling. I can be a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\" so I was doing well in not letting it bother me until I saw her name pop up in a recent text, right after one of those events that I'd assumed he'd seen her at. We decided that going forward, he will proactively tell me anytime he has even incidental contact with her so that I can assume nothing is happening if I don't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a long discussion about respect in general. He is totally willing to drop any friends who are disrespectful to me or our relationship. We also discussed what appropriate behaviors look like; I think he has a much better awareness now. I asked him to think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was out alone with a male friend, and he was a fly on the wall, would be happy to hear us discussing sex or hear the other guy make even borderline disparaging remarks about him? He admitted that he would not, and he will adhere to the same standard going forward with any female friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he said he's willing to refuse any other one-on-one invitations from women who don't want to include me and to drop the friendship if they are pushy about it. Luckily this isn't likely to be a big issue, as I have met and really like most of his female friends, and the ones who live far away and haven't visited yet have already said that they're eager to meet me as soon as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I currently feel a little silly for having worked myself up so much over a woman that he's seen once and exchanged about 20 words of text with in the past 18 months. But relieved that it's resolved. And I learned that the \"out of site out of mind\" tactic is not a good long-term fix for me; if something is bugging me, I need to go ahead and ask about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "My (29F) boyfriend (28M) often makes snide remarks about how my family supports me financially, and calls me privileged for it. We've been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an only child, my family isn't rich but we share what we have with each other. Before my current boyfriend, I was with an ex that painted himself as a good guy up until I moved across the country with him and he isolated me, abused me, stole all my money, and knocked me up. I have a 2 year old daughter with him, but I was able to escape the situation when I was 5 months pregnant. My parents bought my plane ticket home and welcomed me with open arms. They assumed full financial responsibility for my child and I so that I could be a stay at home mom on top of healing from the trauma and going back to college to finish up my degrees and work when I'm ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend comes from an affluent family; however, his father passed away 2 years ago, and he was the sole breadwinner for the family. It turned his family's life upside down, his mother is now living off of money lent from other family members and social security as she's in her 70s and can't work. He works under the table at a place that doesn't pay hourly, it's based on commissions. He's there for 10+ hours some days but if there's no customers, he doesn't get paid a penny. On a good day, he'll make about $70, but that's so disproportionate to what he should be making for that amount of time worked (we're in CA). He's really angry about not having much money, but also refuses to look for another job out of loyalty to his boss who's also his friend. He's always upset about being late on payments as well as his mom asking him for money. I feel bad for him and I try to be as understanding as I can, I know he's under a lot of stress financially, and I never ask him for anything or expect anything from him. Just his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he's been making more and more jabs at me about being \"Miss Privileged\" for taking handouts from my parents and not having to work while he works 5 days a week and is still struggling to make ends meet. All my parents help me with is my $25 a month phone bill and food and clothes from the thrift store for my daughter. I left everything I had when I left my ex and came home to my parents and live minimalistically, but my boyfriend had many payments he's responsible for (car, phone, credit card, student loans, helping his mom, etc). I'm trying to be empathetic towards him and I know he has it much harder than me, but there's nothing I can do about it and I don't think I should be ashamed for having a family that takes care of me when I'm down.\n",

      "Title: My bf 32M being rigid about technicality over my 38 F well-meaning gesture (and cultural differences)\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "My boyfriend accused me of “deceiving” his friends because I secretly paid for a meal in Korea last year, which is a common cultural gesture. He brought it up months later during dinner and wouldn’t let it go, even after I explained. Now we’re not talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warning: wall of text \n",
      "\n",
      "Last night, me (38 F) and my bf (32 M) of 1.5 years went out to dinner (korean bbq). For context, I am from South Korea and he from Europe. And we’re currently traveling in Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the lovely meal, he saw this woman from a different table telling her friends shed go to the bathroom but instead she went to the counter to pay for the meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Btw, this is a very korean thing and i did this too when my bf was in korea last year and his work friend came to korea with his wife to travel. I paid (it was only about $35) largely because we were all having a lovely time and also it is just korean hospitality. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the friends realized what i did they said they hoped to split the bill, and i explained to them that it’s korean custom to treat friends and guests like this and that usually the older one pays for the meal (and i was the oldest by a few years).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway that night ended very well with the friends thanking and saying theyd treat me when i come to their city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to last night, my bf was observing this woman and said, “Look, shes deceiving them like you did.” I felt quite bad at his phrasing but decided to let it slide and instead explained how common it is in Korea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still he was focused on confirming i was deceiving everyone when i said id go to the bathroom when that wasn’t what i was doing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, not wanting to ruin the night and also because we were close to the next table and i didn’t want to get embarrassed by fighting with him, i explained it is a gesture (almost a cliche) here. The thing is he is very fluent in korean and knows a lot about korea having lived here for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, as he kept insisting “you did deceive us. You know they were quite upset?” And i said “upset? I do remember them saying theyd like to split the bill but then i did explain the culture and we were all good at the end, and your friend even praised me the next day to you via text (talking about my kindness)”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently that didn’t matter. Because i was lying when i said id go to the bathroom . Now, i was starting to feel upset but i kept my cool and said “oh i see, you are not familiar with this. Let’s just say its a cultural difference between us. Look, i was just making a friendly gesture blah blah” but no, he wasn’t having any of that, ha. \n",
      "\n",
      "And regardless of whos in the wrong here, i was more like, why on earth would you bring that up (well, he says it was because that womans action reminded him of what i did) and revisit the moment to point out my wrongs from half a year ago? We were having a good time yesterday. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re still not talking as i can’t possibly wrap my head around this and i dont even want to see him or look him in the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Id really love some advice on how to best process this situation? Did I do something really wrong here?\n",

      "I’m dating someone who is amazing to me on all platforms. Everyone deserves to feel this type of undevoted love and commitment. But there’s something that I can’t get past— his drinking. And it sucks because he is not a mean drunk, abusive, nothing. He just drinks too much and too often. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have approached him about it before as I have childhood trauma from alcohol abuse and it’s also just something that is not attractive. We have that conversation twice. He got sober for about 2 weeks and then went back into drinking. I justified it as it’s not hard alcohol, but I told him he can’t just have one drink. He realized it and did better, but it just never stuck. Now, it’s the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned this and I haven’t been able to separate from him since he wasn’t in the states cause he went on a family vacation. \n",
      "\n",
      "His family told him a while back he drinks too much and they were concerned. He knew they were disappointed but nothing seemed to get through to him. Finally, we start dating and 2 months in was the first time I approached the drinking issue. And then the back n fourth of sobriety or cooling it on drinking. He lost 12 lbs from that only. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward- I met his family and his parents thanked me that I helped him cool down on the alcohol. How are they see the love he has and the work he is putting in. But his mom pulled me aside and something along the lines of “I know you love each other but please always remember yourself if it becomes too much”. And that hit. This was back in March. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went on my vacation for my bday 2 ish weeks ago, let’s just say… I was annoyed. On the second to last night, we all went in another country. I knew he was drinking by himself while doing a chores as I always clock when he has been drinking and not telling me. So that next day, he was SEVERELY hungover to where he was shaking, cold shivers, feeling nauseous, etc. at that point, I didn’t feel an ounce of emotion as I was already fed up. Decided I’ll talk to him once we get back to the states. Mind you, not admitting he drank heavily by himself all day. \n",

      "So I talked to him a week later…. Comes over intoxicated…. And passes out as we’re having an important conversation of me expressing my hurt….. \n",

      "\n",
      "Now today.. he’s on his way home from his family vacation and I know I have to have this hard conversation once again and remind myself I need to respect my boundaries and self work I have created since my childhood, which he is aware about. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just here to vent. To remind myself that I’m doing the right thing. To express I have so much love for him, he does anything and everything for me without a second guess.. I’m just hurt trying to compartmentalize it all. I feel like the bad guy for doing this for myself. I want him to better himself but this was an issue I’ve dealt with him 2 months in. He’s not a bad person, I do want a future with him, I just need to take a step away as the drinking issue is truly hurting me.  \n",

      "Title: Girlfriend (27F) didnt want kids with me due to autism risk - Now says its about fearing I (33M) wont share the parenting load. I ended things but she now wants us to stay together as she works through therapy and needs to see me address her concerns in order to be all in on kids together.\n",
      "Body text: My girlfriend (27F) and I (33M) have been together for 2.5 years and have lived together for 9 months. It’s been the best and healthiest relationship I’ve ever had—lots of love, shared values, emotional connection, and fun. But for over two months now, we’ve been stuck in a state of uncertainty that’s taken a toll on me emotionally. For me, having kids is a life long goal and deal breaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root issue has been her fears around having biological children with me. After learning about my nephew’s autism 2 years ago and telling me for a long time that she thinks I might also be on the spectrum (I’m not diagnosed and don’t believe I am), she became deeply anxious about the risk of having a child with autism. We met with a genetic counselor who gave an updated estimated risk between 10–25%. Prior to this genetic counselor meeting, she said indicated that this risk was outside her comfort zone, and she couldn’t say whether she still wanted to have kids with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 2 months, she has been saying she needs more time to think, to get further testing done, and to start therapy (which hadn’t happened until now—she just scheduled her first session). I tried to be supportive, but she stayed stuck in fear, never able to say she was “all in” on kids even when asked directly. At the same time, she would get defensive or angry when I asked for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I reached my limit and broke up with her. I’ve felt hopeless and emotionally drained for months and didn’t see signs that she was getting unstuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she’s asking to revisit the breakup. She moved up her first therapy session and says she’s had a breakthrough: that the real fear isn’t about genetics but about co-parenting. She says her childhood trauma makes her fearful of ending up in a parenting situation where she’s emotionally and mentally alone—especially if we were to raise a child with more complex needs. She said my lack of consistency in sharing household and emotional labor has triggered that fear. She also now says the genetic risk isn’t too high for her anymore, but that being able to handle it depends on how supported she feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first time she framed things this way. For the past two months, it was primarily about the autism risk and genetic testing. I don’t know whether to see this as a real emotional shift or a last-minute pivot because I finally ended things. Even during the breakup, she couldn’t say she was fully in on having kids with me—just that she needs more time and therapy to get clarity and also to see me step up in the mental load sharing and household chores.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Do I give her time and space to go to therapy, work through her fears, and see if this really is the shift we needed?\n",

I recently ended things, but she now wants to revisit the breakup, saying she’s had a personal breakthrough—that the real issue isn’t genetics but fear of not having a supportive partner. She’s just starting therapy and says she now believes the updated autism risk isn’t too high for her even though it seemed like it was previously. I don’t know if I should give her the time to grow or walk away for good\n",

      "Title: My husband (31M) and I (29F) always fight when I'm on vacation (due to chores).\n",
      "Body text: Hello! I'm not good at choosing titles and the situation is a bit more complicated, but here goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been with my husband for around 7 years, married 2. Initially we were both working, and both HARD workers. I usually came back home late from doing three thousand things (I lived alone so I also managed the rest of the survival stuff, of course) and my husband (who lived with his parents) did regular overtime for no reason but that he liked his job so much.  We both specialize in language work (let me know if you need more details).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of our marriage, my husband lost his job. It came out of nowhere as he was performing well, and it took a toll on him emotionally, but I reassured him that everything would be fine since he's actually good at what he does. We came up with this agreement: he'd pick up the majority of the housework while looking for a new job and I'd focus on work, with the exception of things that I prefer to manage myself because I'm more organized and less forgetful, i.e. keeping track of the bills, scheduling appointments and doing the laundry since my clothes need an amount of care I don't want to dump on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This didn't work out well from the start. My husband cooks, which is great, but aside from that he does the bare minimum not to be outright unsanitary. He washes the dishes, tosses the trash, uses the robot to vacuum the floor and puts his dirty clothes in the dedicated laundry area. But... that's it. He cleans surfaces (like the sink or the furniture) whenever I beg him to do it, like after a month or two, and constantly leaves stuff on tables etc around the house without putting it away. This creates mess and dust. Initially I kept asking him to do things, but I stopped recently because I thought that maybe I was micro-managing....... and this is an example of what happened: he left a bag with a piece of clothing he needed to take to the mender (10 minutes away on foot) on a chair for two months, up to the point that when I asked him if I should take it instead, he didn't even remember where he had put it (though it's literally in plain view in the living room).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had conversations with him about this, and he insists that he can't focus on anything else while he's stressed out looking for a job. I understand his feelings, so I told him to let me know if he wants to change the division of labor, since I'd rather know upfront that I need to do something (so I can schedule it in my day directly) rather than having the false reassurance that it'll get done just to find out that it's still there weeks or months later. To this, he tells me not to worry and to leave it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has all come to a head recently because my job has suddenly become more demanding. I was usually able to do some more things around the house whether he asked me for help or not, but for the past few months I've barely had any time to exist outside of work. My company's most important client has started multiple lengthy, specialized projects at the same time, with barely meetable deadlines even with a full team. What's worse: we're two people short. My company doesn't want to say no to the client, and I don't want to say no to the company since my job is otherwise great (plus better paid than 90% of jobs in my industry) AND the only money that keeps me and my husband afloat, so I've been literally working for three people nonstop. I regularly go to sleep with a headache, wake up with a headache, and feel back pain. My fingers have started twitching like a pre-industrial revolution factory worker. I've still been managing admin tasks at home, but I honestly haven't had the physical or emotional strength to un-mess the tables and whatnot. I don't even have it in me to talk to friends most days anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time, whenever it's been the weekend or a bank holiday, we've fought. I start it: I wake up without being too busy to care what's going on, so I look around and I still see items and bags that were there weeks before. So I get upset and I ask him why he can't fulfill his end of the bargain as I do. Yesterday he told me, in more or less these words: \"If I did what you do, I'd be able to do more and faster. You just have to sit and type. It's not the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it may seem absurd, but I could divorce over this. I've been feeling so aggressively angry all of last night, but while typing this, I realize that if it were anyone else I'd just calmly tell them to leave. Yes, if I turn my brain off and forget adulting, I still love my husband: he knows a lot, he's interesting to talk to, he's VERY beautiful and I enjoy spending time together. But as soon as I look around at our life, I feel like an ATM. This isn't the first time that he has implied that my job is easier, and I'm tired of hearing it when I KNOW that I'm breaking my back much harder than a dude dusting shelves for an hour every month. He claims that he didn't mean it as a comparison, that he just wanted to say that my job is easier in a vacuum, but even then...... What does it even mean? And why should it be relevant to him NOT doing the stuff we agreed he would, anyway?\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize if this turned midway into a rant. I guess what I want to know is... Does this sound like we're both being unreasonable? Is it a miscommunication issue? Would a couples counsellor help? Should I find another job at the expense of being poorer and even worse off? I don't know what to say anymore, I just feel tired and I want things to work without constantly fighting over something.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Me (29F) and my unemployed husband (31M) always fight due to the division of chores. We agreed on something, but it isn't working out, and I feel led on and used while my husband claims he's just too overwhelmed by his own situation. Meanwhile, I'm resentful as I'm forfeiting my own life and health to keep a well paid job.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: Thank you all for your input! There was a lot to unpack, and I can't reply to every comment because of time constraints or because I genuinely don't have anything smart/useful to add without doing some introspection. However, I appreciate all advice given.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR my husband of 11 years says he has no emotional connection to me anymore, that he can’t tell me anything or talk to me and I’m looking for advice to help repair this. We have a 7 month old baby and I currently do 95% of the work with the baby. \n",
      "\n",
      "The long post:\n",
      "I was recently told by my husband that he has absolutely no emotional connection to me anymore. I will note that I have BPD but have gotten it under control for the most part. I am 7 months postpartum now and feel better about myself than ever after finding a newfound love and happiness in motherhood that I didn’t expect to find. In our relationship in the past, my feelings were always bigger and stronger and took up more space and I take responsibility for the implications of that. It caused him to bottle things up and he grew anxious telling me anything and that put distance there. This was 11 years in the making and we have been married for 3 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a father, he’s been less than ideal, acting like he can go do whatever he wants whenever he wants and only makes cameos throughout the day when I work a full time job and care for our 7 month old. He told me this week that he can’t stop thinking about how much better his life would be if he didn’t get married and have a kid. He’s in a dark place for sure but I didn’t expect it to be this dark. He just wants to go do what he wants, when he wants and he doesn’t want me to judge him for anything. I judge him because he’s a father and husband and signed up for this a bit and he doesn’t want the responsibility of it. He can’t stand that he needs to fix something in the house or take the garbage out. He’d rather just not live by any rules of life. Fly by the seat of his pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought up how he has no emotional connection to me anymore. He doesn’t know what to do with it. Because he doesn’t want to lose seeing our baby every day either. He said I don’t ask how he is (I have plenty but he never shares or says fine) and I am not emotionally supportive. I’m wondering how else I can be emotionally supportive for him since I care about him deeply and don’t want this marriage to end. I’m wondering what the male emotional support looks like or what other ways I can be there for someone who really is just completely shut down and bitter over the last 11 years. I also dont want to hear to throw in the towel because I love this man, I just have a complicated past and it has tainted our relationship in a lot of ways but I want to repair. But I also want to share the mental load with someone since I currently do it ALL with the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just looking for some advice, someone to talk to, maybe someone who went through this and got out the other side. I’m losing it and I’m so anxious and I just need some perspective here. I want this to work out.\n",

      "Body text: Growing up, I (24F) thought my parents had a solid relationship. But at 20, my mom told me she was blindsided into marrying my dad, who stopped her from pursuing a job abroad. Over the years, I realized how emotionally manipulative and neglectful he has been. He never bonded with me or my brother (26M), never supported us emotionally, and left all the financial and parental responsibilities to my mom. She worked abroad and even had to come home when my brother went through depression. Meanwhile, my dad did nothing but spend her hard-earned money on his hobbies.\n",

      "After his accident last year, he stopped trying to find work. My mom, already working full time as a nurse, had to handle all his medical needs and bills.

      "Title: My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage\n",
      "Body text: I (22 F) and my fiancé (24 M) just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that. Since the very beginning of our relationship, it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother (62 F). Now, it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my now fiancé and I began dating, I began to tell my mom about him, since I was obviously excited about this new relationship. Some of her biggest gripes were that he’s nothing more (in her mind) than a backwoods redneck, and essentially that I’m too good for him. But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long-time Jehovah’s Witnesses. Ever since I told her this, she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had. \n",
      "\n",
      "Example A: She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up. I told her no, it really wasn’t his thing, and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork/construction that he does now, and never took much of an interest in sports. She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn’t done any sports, since he couldn’t do anything that would put him around being people that weren’t JW (I know this is true within the religion, but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young). I’ve tried to explain this as not true, but she simply won’t accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example B: I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in. After dating for almost a year, I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living. Ever since I’ve moved, and especially after I told her about our engagement, all she does is say that I’ve been “sucked in”. She’s convinced I’m in a cult. She’s also said she hates my ex boyfriend (who cheated on me) to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example C: Since starting working post-college, I’ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into (fundraising), and I haven’t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before. I’ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life, like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home, since I have learned that cleaning, cooking, and decorating, are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall. She says I’m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I’m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years. She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from, even after I had said many times I didn’t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new, and find a nice boy down there to settle down with.\n",

      "Example D: Since announcing our engagement, she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare. When I told her our initial wedding date, she asked why we were rushing it. I told her we just didn’t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married. She grilled me and said I must be pregnant, and what happened to having a long engagement? \n",
      "\n",
      "She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family, even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family. From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating, she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer (we live 4.5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends) and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up, she told me it was already too late (this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating)\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family. When we weren’t speaking a couple months back, she didn’t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because “I didn’t ask how the dog was”. I never got a chance to say goodbye. Before this she had previously called me at 12:30 am after we hadn’t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent $10,000 at the casino. Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should’ve never asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family. This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself/our relationship as he calls it. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I told my mother the date, she said it was too soon and that she didn’t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn’t help me with the wedding. I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would, and she said yes. I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors. While this was true, after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well. My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where, for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding, and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since, we’ve been arguing pretty consistently. The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement. He’s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing, and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I’m in. But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I’m going to be loyal to him, not to my mom. The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some, and he’s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to, since it is a small town here. My in laws are absolutely incredible, and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom. We often go out to lunch together, and just spend a lot of time together overall. Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard. I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing. My mom is my only family, since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn’t close with any of her siblings, and all my grandparents are gone. I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else. How do I prove myself to my fiancé? How do I stick up to my mother, and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her? Can I salvage a relationship with both of them? My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me, like being the parent that stayed when my dad left. But I also love my fiancé more than anything, and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us. He’s said he’s just been in a down mood in general, he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement, because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness. I’ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it’s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings. Thank you in advance for any advice\n",

      "TLDR: My mom has disrespected my fiancé and our relationship from the start, and her constant interference has led him to postpone our wedding. He wants me to prove I can stand up to her and put our relationship first. I’m torn between my only family and the person I want to spend my life with.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "My (29f) boyfriend (32m) and I have been together for 4 years. We have had issues with him cheating and it’s recently gotten worse but he never takes accountability or admits to his wrongdoing because of a situation that happened before we were together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before we got together, I hooked up with a girl that I was friends with at the time and and didn’t tell him. He went through my phone and found out and was livid and said I was a liar because he inferred based on our texts that I hooked up with her boyfriend at the time as well (as a threesome). I didn’t. He has always been convinced that I did and will literally throw it in my face whenever I call him out on anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I found out that he invited a girl to our apartment when I was out of town, took my car to see another girl while his was getting fixed and it was on the SAME DAY he took me to get my birthday present, he drove two hours away to meet up with a girl he’s been talking to for over a year, lied to me about working an extra overnight shift at work and went to some girls house and spent the night. This was all within the last month. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been dating since January 2025. It’s been smooth sailing and we really care about each other — except for one issue: his girl best friend, we’ll call her Emma. They text constantly and he’s always confided in her about our relationship, since we started seeing each other. In my past relationships, female friendships have never been an issue. But this is different- she texts him like he’s her boyfriend (ex: “ok, boarding my flight right now! Ok just landed safely!”) What makes it worse? They have a history - they’ve kissed, and admitted feelings for each other last year. At the time, they didn’t date, because my boyfriend was hooking up with Emma’s friend and they didn’t want to hurt her. Well, it did - Emma’s friend found out and has since cut her off.\n",

He said he can work on boundaries with her, but he’s not super convincing and I still feel uneasy.

      "Body text: My husband was diagnosed with depression few years ago and takes depression medication. He gets angry easily and lashes out on me when he is stressed. We currently have a newborn baby (1 month old). My husband is willing and shares responsibility with the baby. However when anything goes wrong or out of plan with the baby or when he gets too stressed he takes it out on me. He blames me and my mother who is also here helping with the baby. It is causing me so much stress in addition to taking care of the baby. He is usually very rigid in his beliefs and makes the baby cry while he takes care of him. He patches up with me after a day or so and apologises. However the constant stress of having to deal with his tantrums and blaming is taking a serious toll on me at this already stressful time.His medication seems to be making him angry when he does not get enough sleep. All this conflict is making me very emotional and depressed myself. Despite taking care of the baby for most of the day, he keeps blaming me for any inconvenience he faces with the baby. This repeats every few days. I am not able to understand how I can cope with his behaviour. I’ve contemplated divorce before however he keeps letting me know how much he loves me and takes good care of me when he is not in his stressed. I am so lost and looking for some direction in how I can handle this situation and relationship\n",

His friends were very nice, but after I said a comment to him, he told me “shut the fuck up” and “don’t look at me like that” to which I was shocked by. They were both said in a joking tone, not mean. He has said something like that to me one other time a few months ago and i immediately told him to never speak to me like that. He apologized and hasn’t since then. I think it was him being drunk and with his friends and wanting to impress them or whatever.

      "Body text: Update 1  \n",
      "Last night I tried searching for her favorite blue dress in her size but couldn't find it. I'm not sure they make it anymore. I called my sister as she is a seamstress and asked her to modify my wife's favorite dress. When my wife fell asleep I took the dress and one of her newer dresses to her to see what she could do. When I learn how to put a picture here I will. She added more holes, buttons and this asian belt thing I see the japanese women with the white face make up wear. My sister put it in a nice box for me with pink ribbon on top because my wife loves the color pink.  I brought it home and woke my wife up for a surprise. At first I know the dress put her off. When she tried it, I could hear for just a second a squeak. Her high-pitched squeak when she's happy. She came out twirling and asked where I bought it. When I told her it was her old dress, she ran to the drawer and found it missing. She looked anxious and nervous, not sad. Like she didn't know what to do. I told her how much I love her and how I noticed she doesn't seem to be happy. That there's nothing I won't do to see her happy again. That if she needs ANYTHING to TRULY feel herself,  happy, warm and fuzzy that there is nothing I won't do. We can tailor all her old clothes if she wants to, get a brand new wardrobe if she would like. There are even handheld sewing machines on amazon. Her response was to hug me as tight as she could and asked if we could possibly do a little of both. Her voice was soft like it gets when she's embarrassed and uncomfortable. I felt myself break inside. I love this woman with my whole  being and she feels embarrassed about asking for things, from me, her husband. She's a do it all woman. I just held her as tight as I could without hurting her and had to make her look at me so she could see and understand \"yes, I just want to see you happy again.\" We just held each other for awhile. She looked so tired but that little happy smile is coming back. She played with the bow on her belt. \n",

She recently dropped over 100 lbs in a very short time due to illness. She hates it. All her attempts to dress up or down send her into a quiet spiral she won't tell me about but I see it. I see it when she isn't smiling even when she's concentrating. Her smile is practically glued in place. When she isn't smiling I know something isn't going ok. I caught her pulling on her cheeks, glanced and saw her push her tongue to her cheek to push them out. Lifting and pulling on her cheeks when her skin is firm, tight and there's no sag for her to pull. It looks like a parent pinching their child's cheek but hard. A few times I try to make a little noise in another room, so she doesn't know I saw her. I don't want to make her feel bad. I just don't want my wife to be unhappy anymore. She's never wanted or considered surgery. She supports those who do, but she isn't healthy enough currently for a lot of things, including major surgeries.\n",

I just want her to feel comfortable and happy, I tell her everyday how beautiful she is. No photo i've ever held of her was ever \"not beautiful\" to me. I know she believes me, but am I sending her mixed signals? What can i do? I just want her to be happy again. I want her to smile again and feel comfortable again.\n",

      "For context we had a rough patch at the start of our marriage because I was so insecure about his exes because he told me about them too much when we were dating, he told me they broke up because it was a mutual understanding because they did not love each other anymore, so I was paranoid because we had dated only a short while after they broke up and got married 6 months after fast-forward to now he confessed that he had lied to me about the reason why, it turns out he cheated on both his exes and his recent one with the one prior and then cheated on the recent one with someone he met on a business trip. I asked him why he didn't tell me he said it was because he knew I loathed cheaters and I wouldn't marry him if I knew he was one (My dad cheated on my mom, which my mom still doesn't know about and I don't have the heart to tell her). \n",

I don't really know whether to believe that that was it, but now I'm stuck because he took off to his friends house because he said he couldn't face me. I don't know what to do moving forward, I want to try to mend things but I don't know how we can manage if he keeps running away from me and I just end up feeling like I'm chasing after a dead end. I guess I'm insecure of being divorced because it's frowned upon where I grew up. Sorry this is long I guess I just need to vent because he won't come home and doesn't want to talk to me.

      "I \\[28M\\] have been dating my girlfriend \\[23F\\] for 4 years now. She is amazing, beautiful and probably one of the only people who has given me an ear and supported me throughout some of my toughest days, particularly as my mental health is not the best at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when going into the relationship, I did mention to her that my parents would be an obstacle.

Since young, myself and my siblings know that my parents want us to be with someone from our culture and ethnicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier on in the relationship, I did have a chat with my mum saying that I am with an English girl and I would like her support/blessing but she would not give it to me... I asked if she could at least meet her and she said she did not want to.\n",

      "Fast forward to today, I am ready to move to the next level with my girlfriend, and my hope was that time would make my parents more receptive towards it. Yesterday evening, I had a chat with my mum and she said the same, saying I am too young and to wait until the right person from our culture comes along. I explained to her the amount of time we had spent together, the trips we had taken and all I am looking for is just support from them.\n",

I can't help who I have fallen in love with but at the same time, family is very important in my culture and I feel trapped in the sense that I want to go to the next level but my family would not permit that. If I wanted to get married to this girl, they would not want anything to do with it. I despise it and find it archaic. I am not sure if it matters but I am still living at home also so if people do suggest for me to go against it then I cannot really escape them at this point of time. I am saving for a house deposit but that could still take a while. I guess this is my fault and I am trapped in the middle.\n",

This moment, and the appreciation my colleagues had, led me to reflect on some of my life's achievements (both personal and work) and I felt a strong sense of appreciation for the privilege I've been fortunate enough to come across, the people in my life, and of course, what I've put in to make it all come together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I reflected on this with my wife in the evening, where I told her this story, told her that it's moments like this that make me reflect on our successes (i.e. mine, hers, and our joint successes), and that I'm grateful that I've had the good fortune of having achieved all of these great things by age 30, many of which were achieved alongside her (e.g. university degree, my leadership position at work, owning our own house, having a family...etc. amongst other things). I also pointed out some of the great achievements that she's personally had as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her first reaction was to say \"I think in some sense you fell into this path, it's not your plan or choice from the beginning\", which I strongly disagreed with, because it is certainly my choice to pursue things that have led to where we are today. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I expressed this, she said \"I think (insert friends' names) all achieved these things\", and when I pushed her on the specifics (as I felt she was just trying to undermine my point, which was to reflect on our successes, not to compare tit-for-tat with others) she just started to handball them away. For example, when I would point out specific things that we've achieved, she would say \"oh, I didn't count that\", or \"to me, that's similar to XYZ\", or \"not many people choose to do that\". \n",
      "\n",
      "We then looked up some statistics, after which she agreed that some of those achievements were worthy. At this point, I just felt that the conversation had completely derailed, as I'm not trying to \"size up\" ourselves, and I thought the broader point of appreciating our successes had been lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "I expressed this to her - that to me, she is always special, always the best, that when she achieves something, I always celebrate it, encourage it, help push her to achieve more, that I always tell her that she can do great things, that she deserves success. Whereas she always downplays my own success, and tells me it's either nothing special, or other people can also do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "She denied that she did this, and said that she cannot offer what I want, and that she cannot (quote) \"adore you\", to which my response was what I wanted was not adoration, but to have someone in my corner, just like I would for her. I gave her the example of always standing by and supporting your sports team, not blindly, but always being excited for every success. I told her that this is what I've always done for her, for my friends, and for my family - be in their corner, always. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told her that if she doesn't feel that the person she married is \"the best\" and to always support and celebrate them unconditionally, then she is condemning her partner (i.e. me) to a life of always needing to prove that they are worthy of her love (which is how I honestly always feel). \n",
      "\n",
      "Her response was \"it's not in my nature to say you are the best, but I do believe you can achieve whatever you want\", which I felt didn't really address my concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told her that she is the only person who never seems to appreciate the things I do, the successes I want to share, the projects I want to embark on...etc., and that even my parents and my friends show so much appreciation for smaller things. Her response was \"I consider you as a friend, a partner but also a competitor, and I think what you can do I also can\". She asked me what I wanted from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just really lost it at this point, and said the way she's treating me is emotional abuse (which I agree is harsh), because all I want is to be supported, to be appreciated, and to be valued, and that it was completely inappropriate for her to make comparisons between me and other people in the first place. I also said that I have never, ever pointed at someone and told her that what she does or what she has achieved is the same as them and not special, because it's just really insulting to do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "She ended up telling me she's \"sorry that hurts\" (not even sorry for her actions), and that \"I think I'm jealous with you and feel insecure. That's why I downplayed your achievement\", which I understand, but I've always celebrated her achievements, and even in our conversation today, brought up so many of the great things she's done. I just told her that I don't think she's capable of understanding my point of view, so best to just leave it for today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just at my wit's end because this has been happening for years, and I honestly just feel like every moment is me trying to earn some little bit of appreciation or acknowledgement from her. I really, honestly try my very best, and it's not like I expect her to say any grandiose things, just that I'm a good partner, that I make her happy, that she appreciates me, that XYZ is a \"great achievement\". That's all. I'm honestly just tired of having to feel like I need to \"earn\" her appreciation all the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the years, and years this has been going on for, I really feel like I've had enough and I'm just tired of not having someone to be able to share the exciting moments with without it becoming a buzz-kill. This will just come up every few weeks / months. I feel that her behaviour is toxic. I don't know if I should draw a line under this relationship and move on. I don't know what I could say to her to help her understand. \n",

By too long I mean I get worried after 12-16 hours. But every week or so he just disappears for more than 20-24 hours and then says sorry when I bring it up and say he was busy. I made it clear many times that I don't want us to talk for hours everytime we call but just a quick 30 second call or a one lined text are fine. He disappeared again around a week ago and completely ignored the fact that I called him and texted him many times. After that he said sorry and I said that was the last time I was forgiving him for this. The day before yesterday he disappeared again and when I called in the evening at around 19:30 he said his phone was off untill 11:00 and after that he thought I had classes. When he said that I just couldn't hold back my tears and cried for hours. I didn't know how I felt so hurt but I just couldn't stop crying. He sent me a few texts saying sorry and he is calling more often to check on me since then but I just don't want to reciprocate. I don't know how I feel and I just feel broken.

Shortly after this I dropped her off at her house and went home. The next day I asked her if she remembered what happened last night and she said she can’t remember anything (Bear in mind when I picked her up she was almost completely sober and said multiple times how she feels like she sobered up already) is she lying to me and acting like it never happened or being genuine. I’m not sure if I should bring it up or just forget it. I feel so guilty I wished I never kissed her even if she did reciprocate. Do I speak about it with her or leave it alone?\n",

      "Body text: The title is pretty self explanatory but I will provide some more details. I don't know where to start but I guess I can begin by asking my questions. 1) What can I do to feel like my husband actually hears my point of view and understands it? 2) Is the problem with me and I need to either ask for help better or change my expectations? 3) How do we change this dynamic so it works better in the future?\n",
      "\n",
      "Husband (45M) and I (38F) had a discussion (not a fight because it was respectful so more like a disagreement) last night while I was cooking dinner, which started with a comment about when he asked when the last time our (his) dog had a bath. Our dog has chronic skin issues and take multiple daily medicines, medicated baths 3x a week, and a monthly steroid shot to keep everything at bay. I responded with well what do you give your own dog a bath instead of nagging me. This led into a conversation about our division of labor which admittedly is pretty even...he drops of kids in the morning, i pick them up in the afternoon, he cooks dinner, i do the dishes, while he cooks I give kids a bath. You get the idea. The only unevenness comes from the other choices inside and outside the house. The inside of the house I mostly take care of (laundry, bathrooms, general organization and pick up) while he maintains the outside farm animals and make repairs and I take care of the garden. I think he has helped me fold laundry once (unasked) in 15 years. If I ask he will stop and help....but I have to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "So back to the discussion. I told him that if I cant manage to fold the towels (a clean pile has been sitting on the dinning room table) in the last two weeks (added work responsibilities) then when have I had the time to give a dog a bath. He said I just need to ask him to do it. I said if he known it needs to be done then just do it himself, he is capable and has eyeballs and can see what needs to be done. That when he verbalizes the to-do list of what we need to do (which 99.9%) of the time I do on my own, it just feels like nagging and a constant reminder of what I haven't finished yet. That reminders aren't helpful, but what would be helpful would be to just do the task. He then went into a rant about how he isn't a mind reader and he has his other responsibilities and that if he helps me fold the towels then I will just find something else to do instead of relaxing and sitting on the couch with him and the kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like whenever we have these discussions it becomes a circular argument, I don't feel heard, he thinks that I feel like he doesn't contribute and nothing gets resolved. Then our schedules calm down and I get caught up and everything is okay again until I get overwhelmed again. I don't know... when I see him struggling, I will stop what I am doing to help him (unasked) if I can manage it. Which also puts me behind in my task or I give up all my free time. But it feels like it doesn't happen in reverse or it does IF I only ask. And I leave the discussions feeling like it was all me and I need to make adjustments but I never hear from him, your right I can do this or that. So reddit can you answer my 3 questions or give me advice or perspective in how to break this cycle. We need a new dynamics so our house can run more efficiently and both don't feel like we are burning the candle at both ends.\n",

      "Body text: Hi all. So my boyfriend (21m) and I (20f) have flown to a different city this weekend for him to meet my parents for the first time. We’ve been dating for almost a year and are pretty serious- planning to move in together in the fall and talking about other bigger long term plans. \n",
      "\n",
      "My relationship with my parents has always been a bit rocky, the reasons as to why are a lot to get into, but it’s almost like my parents just had kids to fulfil the societal pressures. I think my mom also had a rough childhood and is just starting to go to therapy for it, but aspects of that definitely affected our relationship growing up. The biggest thing tho is that teasing is really common in my family, often to the point where the person being teased gets upset. Especially me in the past as I can be pretty sensitive. My house was also not the one where I could bring friends over at will just to chill- it was an ask ahead, double check, get permission before people come over kind of deal. So bringing my boyfriend to meet my parents was no small thing, not just to me but to my parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was prepared for things to go well- things went great when I met his parents- or maybe for my parents to not be super warm to him at first. When they first met, everything seemed great on the outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when we were alone, he said “I don’t like how your parents talk to you, it’s more than teasing, it’s bullying, they just seem like bad people” etc etc. I cant quite say the right thing on the offence, because I know my parents are a bit hard to get along with, but for me that’s how it’s always been. And it’s been so long since I had someone over to meet them that I really have no clue how to handle this. My mom asked me today if she was doing a good job and I had no clue how to give better feedback. My boyfriend said pretty much the same thing he said yesterday, today. “I dont like how they talk to you at all and that overshadows everything else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He says he’ll just deal with it, and he’ll never say anything bad or go against them to their face. But I want to spend a lifetime with him! And I don’t want to imagine every visit with my family and him together ending with me crying and him saying “I dislike the people who raised you.” But at the same time my parents are like that. \n",

      "\n",
      "Update: thank you everyone for the advice. After my boyfriend and I got ready for bed I told him “hey, you’re right, you don’t have to like my parents, especially since you’re disliking them because you feel like they don’t respect me. But I have to deal with it myself in my own ways.” He said he appreciated hearing that, and it made him feel really relieved. My favourite thing he said though was “I appreciated hearing that, but I didn’t need to hear it. I will support you and stick up for you regardless” which really shows the guy he is. I love him a lot, and of course there’s a reason I live a 14 hour drive away from my parents, so I shouldn’t be totally surprised. I also booked myself a therapy appointment for next Wednesday as per some of the advice here, so that will help too. Overall, thank you everyone for talking me down and respectfully getting me to realize I was in the wrong. \n",

      "I had no problem paying for gas or cigarettes when he needed, it wasn’t everyday and i had a chunk of change saved up from working (I took a break from working to go back to therapy and figure out what career i wanted to do). But after this had happened for a couple months I started to get curious because he hadn’t bought any truck parts for a few weeks but he was still running out of money really quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been through some crappy past relationships and have made a bad habit out of checking phones, so I had decided to go through his phone after not doing so for about 6 months or better. I found he had been sending $50 basically every other day to a friend of his who lives about 5 minutes away from us and i thought it was really strange because he wasn’t doing any work for us and he wasn’t coming home with anything like clothes or tools or such. Well about a week later I had gone through his phone again and found that he had been sending more money and even $100 at a time to this friend. My boyfriend had a past of doing pills and drinking before we got together so my first thought was “maybe he’s back on pills again”. What I didn’t know was that it would turn out to be worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "My curiosity got the better of me one day so when he had gone to work, I went out to his shop that’s behind our house and started looking around for anything that would clue me in on what was going on. What I didn’t intend to find was little straws with white powder in them, a little bowl with this shiny powder in it, and a meth pipe weirdly attached to part of a bong. I couldn’t even begin to grasp that he could be smoking meth, but i had nothing but proof in front of me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I waited until he got home to confront him and at first he denied denied denied. And made up lies saying it was his cousins stuff and that he would never do that or just completely ignoring any question I asked. Well after 10 minutes of complete silence from me he broke down and just started sobbing saying he’s been using meth since before we got together (over 2 years) and that he’s tried to quit but he just can’t. I couldn’t believe that he could hide that for so long behind my back. Almost right under my nose. But finding all this out, it explained so many behaviors he had. Being up all night some nights just working on “projects” that never got finished, going through all of his own stuff just to see what he’s got, feeling all of a sudden sick but blaming it on allergies or the pressure in the air changing. But it all makes sense. Withdrawals, drug usage, constantly thinking any noise outside means someone is outside messing with our stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had a few conversations about it, and he knows I want him to quit, but he doesn’t want to talk about it any. He just wants to sweep it under the rug and I can’t. I feel hurt and betrayed. How can you say you love me but hide this from me since the very beginning. I just want advice on how to handle this all. How do we get through this? How do i help him? At what point should I/do i walk away? How do we begin to rebuild the trust that was broken?\n",

      "TL;DR, I found out my boyfriend has been smoking and snorting meth throughout our entire relationship, and I don’t know how to get through this or if it’s a deal breaker\n",

      "Body text: My (29M) girlfriend (27F) and I have been together for over six years. I love her deeply, and I know she loves me as well - so much so that we fully intended to get married and start a family. I can't say it has always been the smoothest - we've struggled at times with her cleanliness, trust, her ability to follow through with promises/tasks, and her finances in particular. She misjudged how much she could pay for rent when we moved in together four years ago while she was still in school and, combined with a car that I paid for, wound up owing me around $24K. She always told me she intended to pay it back and I fully believe that is true. Recently, she has been lightly pushing for me to get a condo for us. She never pressured, but went out and found places that might be nice and in our budget and she claimed it would be good for our relationship - we would have more space to be less cluttered and could find a place we could grow into with children. I finally found one I liked, that was in budget assuming she could contribute a portion of the mortgage every month, and got it. The deposit is in and we're in escrow. I've had real anxiety the last few weeks about finances - my ability to pay for the condo, her ability to pay the piece of the mortgage, and the fact that almost all my money is going into the down payment. I expressed this to her, and she basically said that her finances are fine and she would be able to pay the mortgage. Yesterday, I learned that wasn't totally true. She has had a spending addiction since the top of the year (she blames it on depression), using over $20K that her aunt gave her to buy all sorts of things, without telling me about any of it. During this time, I had to loan her money occasionally (she always paid it back) for various things when she said her accounts were low. I'm gutted. She took money we could have used to stabilize our lives or to pay me back and threw it away. She's begging me for another chance, to go to therapy and to fix this, but I feel so betrayed - I told her my biggest worry was having our finances in order with this new place and she was spending tens of thousands of dollars behind my back. I still love her and I know she didn't mean to hurt me like this, but I just don't know if this relationship is worth saving at this point. \n",

For example apparently when I put my forks handle up in the dishrack, that was incorrect since the part you eat with touches the bottom, or for example after washing a dish I shouldn’t let it touch the sink again because that was dirty.

I tried to learn all of these rules but ultimately just got so many lectures that I avoid the living room altogether and mostly stay in my room now (we have a 2 bed apartment).

But I’m worried that since we haven’t been able to make home life work, and since we’ve been more distant than ever, this would be a mistake. I’m also worried about her timelines which she’s expressed concern about, and delaying them. I’m also worried talking to her about this wouldn’t be productive… she’ll definitely blame me. I am not sure if it would trouble her to get divorced or live separately after having a child. I’m very worried about this outcome because I’m confident I would be pushed out of my child’s life… like I was out of the living room. I think the cause of this is just that she has a greater capacity for confrontation… she can argue for hours, but I’m exhausted after 30 min of going in circles… she seems entirely unfazed by my complaints.\n",

      "Body text: I (29f) am unsure if I should end things with my (38m) fiancé.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some background, we’ve been together 7 years, and have know each other for 8. We got engaged last April. Our relationship has had been pretty rough from the start with a lot of trust issues sparking from him talking to women to try to have a threesome. I was originally ok with this as we agreed that I would be involved in the conversations so I knew what was happening. That obviously didn’t pan out and he ended up admitting to talking to someone for 6 months behind my back because he didn’t think I would agree to sleep with her. He was right and to put it into context the girl was 18 at the time he was 33. He said they talked only over instagram, from his fake account which I didn’t know existed at the time, and she didn’t know him and they never met up. He also was messaging girls he’s dated previously from his personal instagram behind my back to flirt, not ask for the threesome. Anyways after he admitted this 6 month thing with the 18 year old we agreed to stop trying for a threesome because he taking advantage of the situation. I also want to mention through this time it wasn’t good communication. There was a lot of yelling and him gaslighting me and it took a long time for him to admit anything. He also had a habit of being physical with the space around him in his anger (anger because I was finding things out) and he often times called me crazy and insecure for asking him about these things or to see his phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then hes deleted his fake account but has disrespected me in many other ways whether it was still messaging people he’s been on dates with before (not flirting per say but why is he talking to them still) or has been interested in before. I also found out he had thousands of screenshots of women on his phone ranging from pornographic photos to screenshots of people he knows even if it was just selfies. A lot of these screenshots however were, as I call them, Florida looking girls in their late teens/early 20s that he didn’t know. I’ve talked to him about this and he’s said he’s stopped the behaviour which I can confirm because I’ve seen his photos after this. He did also admit to having a porn addiction and most of the screenshotting was impulsive. He’s been working on that since and I do think it’s gotten better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally jump to this past year we got engaged on a trip and things were really good but there was a huge drop off in our dynamic, I would say over the last 7 months. We started going to therapy because of it and I became very unsure about his ability to be a good partner and eventually father.  Previous feelings of hurt surfaced with respects to all that’s happened in our past because it wasn’t dealt with in a healthy way, again also a reason we started therapy. I kept thinking to myself how can I marry someone who has done these things to me. We decided to postpone the wedding 2 days ago and I found out that he went and message a 22 year old “family friend” asking when she’d be back from school 3 hours after we emailed our venue to postpone. I say family friend loosely because his parent and her parents are friends but he’s only spoken to her 2 occasion in a group setting with the parents there and they weren’t even talking to each other directly (I was there when this happened). He said he reached out to her because his family was going to see her a lot this summer since they’re family friends and because she followed him on instagram. Mind you she’s almost never there when the family’s get together, in the 8 years I’ve known him she’s been there 2 times. I said that a follow isn’t an invitation to talk to her and also she looks exactly like the Florida girls he was screenshotting before so I’m sure there’s more of a sexual interest there. She is really really pretty and he has said he agrees she’s attractive. Either way a 38 year old trying to be friends with a 22year old is weird especially when you’re engaged. He also said he didn’t follow her back because he thought I wouldn’t approve… so he decided to message her behind my back instead. I found out because I noticed he removed some photos of us on his instagram and I asked him why he did that. He didn’t have a reason and so I asked to see his phone. He gave it to me after deleting something which I saw and I had to literally begging him to tell me who he was talking before admitting it. He also said he didn’t want to tell he because I would leave him if I knew… so why do it? He clearly knew it was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the guy and I want to be with him but I feel like he’ll never change. He feels awful for this but I wonder if it’s just cause he was caught and I wonder where their conversation would have gone if I didn’t find out… I’m so hurt, we’re engaged and actively working on mending our relationship and going to therapy and he does this. I’m currently taking a break from him, we’re not talking and I’ve moved in with my dad for space but I don’t know what to do.\n",

      "Body text: My bf (M 25) of 10yrs wanted me to try living with his family. I (F 24) am really hesitant because I grew up independently and I don’t want to be a burden somehow.

      "I have been with my boyfriend for 2+ years. We do not live together because our children from our previous marriages are still at home. We may move in together in a few years after they all leave for college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having met later in life, of course we both come into the relationship with lots of pre-existing friendships. Many of them have melded seamlessly, but there are some obstacles, especially with relationships on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my case, most of my friends were really my friends and not “friends of the marriage” - so he’s pretty much fully integrated into my social life. All of my friends have accepted him warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his case, he has a few friends who are equally good friends with him and his ex-wife and are trying to maintain a relationship with both. There are two women in particular who are slightly closer to his ex-wife than they are to him. They are both still his friends, but have said that they don’t want to hang out with me at all because that feels disloyal to his ex-wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one woman I don’t have so much of a problem with because he only sees her when he is with her entire family, including her husband and kids. I mean, it doesn’t feel great to be excluded, but I understand that it’s about his kids’ relationship with her kids as much as anything else so I can live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other woman really grinds my gears. She wants to hang out with him one on one. They went out for a late dinner at a nice restaurant last year for example, and he said that I couldn’t come because she wouldn’t feel comfortable with it. I told him that was fine, but I don’t feel comfortable with this kind of thing occurring regularly with her unless she is willing to include me at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other nuance to this is that I’ve actually known her for many years because their kids went to grade school in middle school together. She was always very rude and dismissive to me. She is a wealthy, fancy person and really seems to spend a lot of time on her appearance. I am a bit plainer by choice. I always had the impression that she thought I was too frumpy and homely to be in her friend group. Interestingly, I mentioned this to my boyfriend and said that I was maybe mistaken in my impression and reading her signals wrong — and he said probably not; that’s kind of how she is!! \n",
      "\n",
      "When they went out and he told her we were together, she claimed that she had no idea who I was, and had never met me as far as she could remember, that my name didn’t even ring a bell. To me this is either a lie to make me seem unimportant or it’s the truth and she was really so dismissive with me that I made no impression on her despite having met her 30 or 40 times over the course of a decade. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn’t like that when he told her we were dating and showed her a picture of me, she said “oh that doesn’t seem like your type; I thought you would go for someone based on more superficial qualities.” His interpretation was that somehow this was a compliment implying that I was more of a natural beauty and not over processed… given my history with her. I feel like it was more like she wanted to tell him that I’m homely but knew she couldn’t get away with just saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also told him she was disappointed that he was committing himself to a monogamous relationship because in her view, humans aren’t meant to be monogamous and that he would have more fun sleeping around.\n",

      "\n",
      "I will say I don’t think either of them actually have any intention of hooking up. I do believe that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will also say that he has been scrupulously honest. If he wanted to hook up with her, it would be incredibly easy for him to do since we don’t live together or keep tabs on each other. He could have chosen not to mention meeting with her or could have chosen to edit his recap of their dinner in a less incriminating way. I am grateful for the honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what I’m struggling to get him to understand is that even if I 100% trust him not to do anything with her, the whole situation still feels disrespectful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seems to somewhat understand, but we’re kind of an impasse of what to do next. He has agreed that next time she brings up getting together he will try to steer it towards a group situation that includes me. \n",

      "Title: How do I forgive the way our relationship started?\n",
      "Body text: I (25F) met my boyfriend (28M) 4.5 years ago. When we first met, he insisted he didn’t want a relationship, but liked me and wanted to keep seeing me casually. I agreed to this because I wasn’t sure what I wanted, and was happy to take it slow for a while. Increasingly, I found myself wanting a relationship with him, but he stayed firm in not wanting a relationship. Despite not wanting to be official, our ‘relationship’ was progressing as an official relationship would (increasingly we were meeting each others friends and family, and it was clear we both had feelings for each other). Nonetheless, he slept with several other people during this time, and I slept with one other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year, I couldn’t do it any more, and told him I either needed to be in a relationship or needed to break up. He agreed to a relationship, but a short time later said actually he couldn’t do it, and we broke up. We didn’t talk for a couple of months, then slowly started seeing each other again. Our relationship continued to progress, and eventually about four months later, he acknowledged that I was, for all intents and purposes, his girlfriend, and we might as well call a spade a spade. However, I was due to go away for several months that summer, and he asked that we keep it an open relationship, because he thought he’d struggle with me being away. I was okay with this, because I thought it’d be mutual, and I’d sleep with others too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut forward to Summer, once we were apart, and I realised I didn’t want to sleep with anyone else, and the idea of him sleeping with others bothered me. I phoned him and told him. He said he hadn’t yet slept with others but the idea of not being able to was a problem for him and we might need to break up. I said, if the only option was to break up, we’d have to break up. I was sad about that, but genuinely felt that the only options for me were to be exclusive or to break up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed to give each other space and didn’t really talk for a few days, and after a few days he phoned and said he’d like to be exclusive. However, after I arrived home, he told me in person that over those few days he’d slept with someone else. He said sleeping with someone else had made him realise he only wanted me. I was hurt, but felt I could move on if it meant we were going to be in an exclusive relationship moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward 3 years to today, and he’s the most amazing boyfriend. He is gentle, caring, considerate. He goes above and beyond to respond to my needs, as I do his. I can’t fault our relationship as it is now. I’m certain he is who I want to be with forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, I don’t think I’ve ever really gotten over the way our relationship started, and it’s started to really interfere with how I feel about him. I often feel angry at him, and like I’ve never really got a sense of empowerment back after trampling all over my own boundaries by agreeing to proceed with the relationship. I really want to put the past behind me and move on, because I think we have something really good, but I don’t know how to get rid of the anger beneath the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the only way to get past it is if we communicate openly about it, but I don’t really know how to do that, or what I need from him. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for moving on from a past hurt in a relationship, particularly one where you feel like you’ve compromised yourself, and can’t get back a sense of personal power?\n",

      "\n",
      "Long story short, my gf and I have been dating for two and a half years. She is 30 and im 26. We have never had a “good time” in our relationship. In the beginning stages, I was still living with my homophobic family and in nursing school, I let her know it would not be easy and school is a priority, she agreed. However our relationship became so strained she asked me to move in, once I decided to tell my parents and move in, she said she would be scared to cheat on me and wanted to be honest. So we broke up This has happened three times, each time we got back together, i would get incredibly anxious she would do it again I would start fights and need to figure out if she would leave me again. each time we broke up, she would date someone new in a week. I have a huge abandonment wound from this and each time she asked for me back, I would hound her with questions, ask every other second if she loved me, and would accuse her of leaving me again. It caused so many fights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently we have been together and it’s been nothing but fights since December. I feel awful she broke last month and said she feels like a shell of a human, I told her we can still work past this. My brother just recently got diagnosed with cancer, so naturally I feel emotionally vulnerable, yet she has still stayed. It completely wiped away the past of her leaving me when I needed her most. But is now saying I drain her energy, she has no good memories to hold onto, and she wants to break up but has not officially decided yet and waiting to see if the feeling goes away. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the root of the problem was needing to know she would not abandon me again like previous times and she does truly care. I now know she does, how can I reverse it and not drain her energy. I love her more than anything and the pain of the past definitely took a toll on us. \n",

      "Body text: TL;DR: Basically, I have a relationship with a girl that I like a lot; we have a very satisfying romantic life, but sex is almost always a problem. I have to initiate every time, and even when it gets going (once per month or less) the experience we have is kinda passionless and very clunky, for lack of a better word.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s not that we haven’t discussed the problem through the years: the conversation always started from me, and she’s always reluctant to talk about it (she’s not much for difficult psychological and emotional matters and she’s kinds shy). And through the years she gave many different reasons for her apparent disinterest in sex (or in sex with me). Most importantly, that she never was that interested in the thing in the first place (even though in the beginning she was the one pestering me because we weren’t having enough moments of physical intimacy), but also she talked about me not being 100% her type, e.g. she would like for me to have a more athletic, even muscular body, while I’m more of a chubby guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem is (and trust me, I’m not really bragging or anything here, I’m just trying to be as honest as possible) that I’m not at all an ugly dude: I’m very confident, I know how to fascinate a girl and I’ve had many occasions to be flirtatious with others -even unfaithful- but I’ve never been able to act upon them, because I’m just not that kind of person. God knows how hard it has been, with sexual satisfaction coming my way once a month or even less, and always under my solicitation.\n",

      "That is not to say that our feelings for each other aren’t the real deal and that’s what makes me feel so bad about this.

      "\n",
      "It’s just that… having basically no sexual life sometimes really hurts. I’m not at all an hyper-sexual guy, and in my mind it feels at times kinda base and petty to make such a big deal about sex, when everything else works well. But you know, what makes this even more aggravating is the fact that having to always initiate any moment of intimacy, and then seeing her mostly interested in having her needs satisfied, while being kinda not interested, or awkward and detached when it comes to my part of the deal… makes for a very miserable experience.\n",

I cried for hours and feel like my tears upset him, with him saying things like “You cry over the littlest things” or “If you start, I’m leaving.” We've almost broken up one time because he felt torn between me and work, but he later apologised and promised to make both work. I’m struggling because I feel unseen and unsupported, and I’m afraid that my emotions push him away. Has anyone else been in a relationship like this?

And instead of checking in, he replied, \"Please no\" \"Not tonight\" \"Should I call you later?\" At this point my heart broke because I really needed to talk about something we had an argument about earlier this week so I told him I need space instead and I didn't think a call would help me right now. To which he replies: Ok, don't overthink things.\n",
      "* **Hours of tears.** That response crushed me. I cried for almost two hours straight and I’m terrified that if he *does* see me crying, he’ll pull back even further.\n",
      "* **“You cry over the littlest things.”** When I do cry, he tells me I need to stop—“you cry over the smallest stuff.” My own mom has said that I do that, and it leaves me feeling invalidated and ashamed. Not that I don't think I should cry but I know that's how I process my emotions but if two people have said the same thing, I was willing to put in the effort to control my tears if that meant I was hurting him because he said every time I cried, he'd feel like a piece of shit.\n",
      "* **Dinner meltdown.** One evening I started crying at the table, and he literally walked away mid-meal. I sat there crying alone while he left, took a shower, and went to his room. He didn't even have dinner even though he said he was hungry before everything happened.\n",
      "* **Hurtful ultimatums.** Sometimes when I tear up, he says things like, “If you start, I’m leaving,” which makes me feel so horrible.\n",
      "* **The almost-breakup.** He once said he needed to choose between me and his work and suggested a break—*he* initiated it. But an hour later he came back, apologised, and said he’d been wrong to choose. He promised he wants both of me and his work so he'd try to make things work. I *do* see him trying in moments like that, and I appreciate it.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "Hi everyone, I (24F) really need some support or advice on this. I apologize to dump on everyone but I am genuinely concerned about my husband (27M). \n",
      "\n",
      "He has always been drinking, since around 14 years old he started and pretty heavily. \n",
      "I have noticed his eyes have a yellowish hue, he doesn’t want to leave the house anymore and the only reason he does leave the house is to buy a 6 pack of beer. On weekdays after work, he stays 1-2 hours drinking and smoking with coworkers. He has admitted drunkenly to me that he can’t go a shift at the restaurant without a beer, or various for that matter. It also affects him financially, he saves little to no money but is responsible with his bills. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t just want to leave him, I’m honestly afraid he will either die drinking or do it on purpose, he has threatened that before. \n",
      "but my options are becoming ever more slim, and I am seeing a rapid decline in interest to go out and do much of anything. Today was a beautiful day and he decided to sit inside, exhausted and just went out for a pack of beer. \n",
      "I am honestly at a breaking point myself, mentally and physically. Chores, planning schedules etc are done by me, since he is normally exhausted or hungover. We both work the same amount of hours every week but I still am able to pull through and manage the house/bills/errands/appointments and go and play with our children. \n",
      "Please no rude comments, I just need some clarity or advice about what to do in this situation. I feel lost, stuck and upset about it all. I have commented he needs professional help but has denied it. Thanks for reading and your time. \n",

      "\n",
      "Today has been hard, and a bit scary. \n",
      "I am currently on maternity leave and so have pretty much 24/7 caring responsibilities for baby apart from the 3 hours a week that I insist on to going to local gym classes (I need this space/time to myself and I’m actively losing baby weight to feel better about myself). I sort all the baby clothes, general health, food prep/ensuring we have formula in and pretty much everything that comes with parenthood. I also make sure our dog is walked everyday and has everything she needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the household chores have fallen to me, he reluctantly does things if I ask him…however he will say that I’m nagging him to do things. In the entirety of our relationship he has cleaned the bathroom maybe 5 times, hoovered/mopped 10 times and generally cleaned the house pretty much never without prompting. Same with clothes washing, I asked him the other day to bring the washing in from the line and he put it in a bag onto the sofa as if the magic clothes fairy was going to whisk it upstairs and put it away.\n",
      "Now, I love him he is a caring guy and is great with our son. But his input is playing with him for an hour or two after work, sometimes he will get up whilst I have an extra 30 mins in bed in the morning to feed baby when he wakes up…but I have to ask him to dress him for the day. He doesn’t think to give him breakfast an hour or so after the first bottle, he’s ’waiting for him to get hungry’ and doesn’t realise you can pre-empt that, I’m not sure he’s ever visited a parenting website or read any books for background knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess what I’m getting at is he doesn’t appreciate the amount I do and the mental load it is to care for another human, I appreciate I am on maternity leave and so have an extra 40 hours but it’s not like this is chill out time for me, I have an 9 month crawler (nearly walker) to keep safe and happy, and a very active dog to keep happy and settled.\n",

      "A slightly biased background but true all the same.\n",

      "The aspects of the situation at the moment is his Gran sadly died and we are potentially buying her house, although we had a survey done and there is a lot more money that needs to make it safe and modernised- money that is coming from my parents and the sale of my house (he is not on the mortgage) both my parents and I are dubious on affordability and he is adamant he wants this house for us despite being able to contribute very little to the purchase.\n",
      "Also, to get a mortgage he has taken on a job recently where his colleagues are lazy and clueless and he feels he is picking up the slack. \n",
      "He has also had a car insurance claim on an  incident that happened a year or so ago come through, it’s clear he is not liable but as he is on business insurance with his Dad it might increase his payments.\n",
      "All these things are stressing him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today he was sorting out stuff to make the house we are in saleable (he is finishing a project in the garden that he started 3 years ago) and was driving here and there to get supplies. We met at a pub whilst I was walking the dog, and it was somewhat strained - I could tell he was stressed but he didn’t say anything so we were just having a reasonably pleasant drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to this evening when he said he would make our evening meal, but instead cleaned the BBQ whilst I bathed and our baby to bed and didn’t make the meal. I questioned him whether he was going to cook, and also brought up the way he had spoken to me regarding taking out a subscription to Disney, as if it was unacceptable for me to sign up to this out of my own money. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got annoyed with each other and I said ‘fuck this I’m done, I don’t want to talk about it’ and went upstairs. He lost his shit, screaming and shouting, punching the wall and broke 2 TV remotes. I think he was also drinking most of the day, although I wasn’t in some of the day so I don’t know how much he had. Anyways, I was upstairs and took my bedding into baby’s room as well as the dog who he let upstairs whilst shouting - poor thing was shaking and cuddled up to me.\n",
      "After about 15 minutes of hearing him from upstairs I went down to make sure he wasn’t going to hurt himself or anything. He has tears in his eyes but when we spoke he said it was my fault and my actions bringing up how he spoke to me that tipped him over the edge, he has never flipped out like that since I met him. Sure we had had the odd (rare) falling out and arguing, but what relationship hasn’t,\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I was insensitive but he didn’t express to me how stressed he felt or how I could help before he blew his top. I don’t know whether it was my fault, and more importantly whether I should accept this behaviour in our relationship. He has made me feel uncomfortable, so much so that I had to go into our sons room and whilst I type this I kind of want to bring our son into the bed with me. \n",

      "Body text: I (F39) have been with my husband (M44) for nearly 13 years. We met at work, and during a team night out, he mentioned that he would always love his ex, who broke up with him years ago. A few years later, after a drunken night, we ended up hooking up and quickly developed feelings for each other. However, on a date, he stated that he will always have some feelings for his ex and felt it was refreshing that he can openly talk to me about them, which raised some red flags for me, but I pushed them aside because I really liked him.  \n",

      "After many happy years together - we got engaged, bought a house, and had our first child. Initially, I didn’t mind him being connected to his ex on Facebook, but things changed when his cousin found boxes of his ex’s belongings in his mother’s garage and returned them to her. His anger over that surprised me, revealing he had clearly been hoarding those items. Months later, while planning our wedding, he received an invite to his ex’s wedding. I told him it felt uncomfortable for him to attend, so he ultimately declined the invitation.  \n",

      "A few weeks later, while he was showing me something on his phone, I saw her name as a recent contact. I don’t usually check his phone, but I felt had to the next morning.

We’ve since married, and while I know I should talk to him about this, I’m ashamed that I went through his phone and it may break the trust between us. \n",

She of course just sits in bed most of the day, watching YouTube, sleeping, or playing Minecraft, and not much else. When I told her I wanted to see where the possibility of the new girl went, she said she was going to write some notes and end her life.

      "Title: My (35F) husband (56M) struggles with trust issues when he is triggered. This serves to trigger my own personal sensitivities which creates a painful cycle of reactivity. HELP!\n",
      "Body text: I (35F) have been married to my husband (56M) a little under 6 months after dating for 3 years. Our relationship is largely a great one and we love each other deeply. We are both living together, financially stable, highly educated and at the tops of our careers. No kids. However, there have been several moments in the past (and now, the present) where he experiences emotional triggers due to past trauma borne from his neglectful parents and emotionally abusive previous partners. He is particularly sensitive to not being listened to or neglected, not being taken seriously or being laughed at/demeaned. Generally, in an argument, he perceives that I engage in these imagined instances of attack to personally hurt him and then goes on the defense as a response. He reacts very immediately (super quick break-neck micro-second emotional changes from being happy to being upset or hurt), is quite harsh in his emotional defensive strikes and is slow to return to reason and regain control. Unfortunately, my partner's reactive tendencies trigger my own past issues with false accusations/emotional projections from family members, feeling intense pressure to defend myself or perform perfection as a way of protecting myself and experiencing chronic low self esteem and helplessness in the face of a now cold and detached loved one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture of our arguments looks roughly like this (I call it the Belt and Snake Trigger Cycle):\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Says or does something not meant AT ALL to be malicious or done/said by mistake (Like as if he has seen a Belt on the road in his path).\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Perceives this as something intentionally and personally done to hurt him to bring him down or belittle him. Goes on the attack and accuses me of being neglectful, distrustful, manipulative and/or hostile (Based on the fact that he has had many negative experiences with Snakes in the past that have bitten him, he erroneously believes the Belt is a Snake and reacts with strong defensive violence).\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Spends hours or even days explaining how my behavior was not at all meant in a way to hurt him. He is often very resistant to my pleas so it takes so long to make him see reason and fact. My defense always hinges on how after 3 years, he MUST know by now that I am not the person he paints me to be and how my very good track record as a girlfriend and wife (which he agrees is very good) should be proof that I have never engaged in that behavior and would never DREAM of not taking him seriously or whatever he has accused me of. In my defense, I do my very best to reason with him with logic by emphasizing the facts surrounding the argument but by the end, I always end up in a torrent of tears, frustration and pain because the process of defending myself is so energy-consuming and reminds me of the many MANY years my family misunderstood and mistreated me for really no reason other than being a punching bag for their projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Eventually, he relents and understands where he misunderstood, sincerely apologizes and vows to work on his emotional triggers. He is very thankful for \"showing him how much I care about him\" and for fighting so hard for our relationship. But the damage is done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: After the argument is resolved, I'm a broken, emotionally exhausted, deeply distressed and triggered mess who feels aggrieved at being accused at all, given how hard I try to support him towards his goal of being more open and trusting of others. I withdraw completely, twice having seismic panic attacks, reliving memories (and sometimes vivid nightmares) of past traumatic incidences where everyone tells me, \"It's all your fault. You were never good enough...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Him: Tries his best to comfort me but honestly, fails at reassuring me that this won't happen again. As far as he is concerned, the matter is resolved and we should move on. To him, this is a totally normal way of dealing with relationship issues (apparently he's had it worse with past partners) and the fact that he is improving over the last two years means things are actually moving in a positive direction overall! \\*thumbs up\\* He has no plans to leave the relationship and I am the love of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I don't think I have it in me to normalize and continue down this painful cycle of reactivity. I have done a lot of emotional shadow work to address my own personal sensitivities (been in therapy since I was 19) so I am able to extend a lot of empathy, patience and understanding when he acts like this. It's the only way I have been able to be rational and not join him while he is spinning off his axis during a triggered episode. I completely concede and celebrate with him on how he has genuinely made big strides of progress in the last 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a recent argument has left me absolutely broken. Yet another miscommunication led him to level the worst accusation against me yet-- he regrets ever trusting me and that I have been lying to him about who I truly am since the day I met him. To me, this is beyond the pale. I cannot accept that, even in his most irrational state, he can believe in that I am truly The Enemy and that I am a grand manipulator here to destroy him. While he regrets saying it now and says I am actually the only one he trusts, I am still devastated. I don't think I can continue with someone who thinks a mistake or misunderstanding should open a trap door to Hell under someone they love. How do I get out of this vicious cycle?\n",

She was emotionally abusive and at one point physically abusive to the point she got arrested during our separation and divorce.

We live together in the house that I lived in for less than a year with my ex wife before I found out about the affair and the divorce process started and she keeps referring to it as \"the house you two bought\".  I wanted the house.  I went had to convince my ex to get it and go out on a limb to get it.  I wanted it.  She never did.

      "The way his employer treated him was, in our view (and our lawyers' view) clearly disability discrimination -- that's a whole other story. But he has engaged lawyers to act on his behalf to sue his employers and hasn't worked since, meaning he hasn't been paid since his breakdown. He also hasn't sought out any other work (which I understand is in his best interests both from a legal and health perspective).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the problems I'm currently facing:\n",
      "1) I hate to say it, but my husband doesn't contribute much around the house. He might tidy the kitchen in the mornings and feeds our cats, but that's about it. So not only am I the only one working, and therefore paying for everything, but I'm also doing most of the chores as well. I also have a physical disability, so this extra workload is wreaking havoc on my body. I already had the majority of the mental load, as I'm the \"household manager\". My husband says he is unable to contribute more due to his mental health issues, and neither is he able to discuss chores or chores allocation for the same reason. He has basically spent the last 6 months playing video games, and doing little else (except the odd meeting with lawyers).\n",
      "2) We can just about scrape by on my salary alone (which I'm extremely grateful for), if we were to budget carefully. I have extreme money anxiety due to previous trauma, but have made steps to organise our finances better. Again, my husband refuses to have a serious talk about money because it's triggering for him. This unfortunately also means that he puts off telling me about the latest legal bill until they've made a final demand for payment. He also withdraws money from our bank account used for handling bills, and often buys cigarettes and snacks, and doesn't tell me, leading to more than one occasion where our mortgage provider has sent threatening messages because there's not enough money in the account for that month's mortgage payment. I've asked my husband to tell me when he makes such withdrawals, and/or to keep an itemised list of when he makes such withdrawals, but he says he doesn't want to stress me out. He also says he feels shame and anxiety at the thought of keeping a list. I offered to give him \"pocket money\", but such idea disgusts him.\n",
      "3) We've previously been excellent at communicating with each other, but any attempts to communicate about serious topics now results in him getting depressed and hiding away, refusing to talk. I'm trying to be as compassionate and supportive as possible, but it often feels like nothing is working, and there is no improvement on his end. Whilst he has just started therapy (yay), he seeks me out for immediate support when he's feeling low or having a panic attack, including when I'm supposed to be working.\n",
      "4) Whenever he comes across any issues in his day-to-day, he will delegate it to me. At one point he tried to \"sign away\" all responsibility to handle his legal matters to me, but I simply could not feasibly do this and handle my day job at the same time. Otherwise, I am responsible for his medical appointments, filling out paperwork, etc. I'm exhausted, but if I don't do these things, he accuses me of not being supportive.\n",
      "5) Things just aren't fun anymore. I think I've laughed 5 times in the last 6 months. My husband gets panic attacks or gets irritable if I suggest we do something together, so I've stopped making plans for the weekend or beyond. Quite frankly, I'm too exhausted to do anything anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do. I can feel myself slipping, mentally. Outside my husband and the limited roles of my therapist, doctor, and social services, I don't have a support network. Whilst I completely sympathise with my husband's mental health issues, it often feels like his mental health is taking absolute priority over mine, but he's also not doing anything to help improve his mental health. I kinda feel like that \"This is fine\" cartoon dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do? How do we address these issues without him running away, having an autistic meltdown, or other unpleasant reaction? How do I stand my ground on the fact that I simply cannot do everything alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My husband has been in a pit of despair for the last 6 months and is sapping our finances. He assigns almost all responsibility (regarding financial and household maintenance, his emotional and physical needs, etc) to solely me. This is unsustainable and we desperately need to discuss, but any attempts to have a serious conversation are shut down because they're too difficult for him.\n",

      "Title: I overshared about my relationship and now I deeply regret it — how do I fix this?\n",
      "Body text: So I (19F) started seeing this guy (21M) a little over a year ago. For both of us, it was the first time something felt this deep and meaningful. In the beginning, I had a habit of talking to my close friends and family about almost everything that was happening in the relationship — good, bad, and in-between. I didn't really see anything wrong with it at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, on the other hand, was much more private. He only talked about us with people he deeply trusted — mostly just his close friends and relatives. He used to say things like, “I’ve realized from past experiences that if you have something beautiful, people are bound to ruin it, so I’d rather keep it to myself.” Back then, I didn’t really understand where he was coming from.\n",

      "But now, after everything we've been through, I do. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, and recently I’ve started to feel like way too many people know things that I wish I had kept between just us. Some of the intimacy feels lost. And what makes it worse is that now people have a bad image of him in their heads — based on moments I vented about, not the full picture. I’ve realized I subconsciously overshared — maybe out of needing support or validation — but now I really regret it.\n",

      "Title: Feel like my (31M) girlfriend (28F) has given up on her appearance\n",
      "Body text: I feel bad even posting this, but I'm nearing my wits end, and I worry about the possible repercussions of asking friends for advice - I don't want what I'm saying to change anyone's perception of my girlfriend or me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been going out for 4 years now, living together for 2. Shortly after moving in together, I started to notice a slow, steady change in our relationship. We used to get dressed up and go out together once or twice a week, we used to go to the gym together 2 or 3 times a week, and we used to have great sex a couple times a week. My girlfriend was also in a running club, did pole fitness, and was into doing big weird expressive makeup looks as a hobby, all of which I loved about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then my girlfriend has given up on the gym completely, mostly can't be bothered going out, and usually makes minimal effort when we do. She also rarely wants to have sex (maybe a couple times a month at most) and doesn't seem all that present or enthusiastic when we do - I don't think she's been the one to initiate in over a year now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's also really given up on wearing makeup, dressing nice, or even really looking after her appearance generally. It's sweatpants and cargos with a hoodie every day, and she's gained a noticeable amount of weight over the last two years. I still think she's beautiful, but I miss seeing her all dressed up - once or twice a year we're invited to a wedding or a posh meal and she really makes a go of it, and I'm completely blown away by how gorgeous she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, I still go to the gym at least four times a week (it was her that really got me into going), I've really developed my sense of style, gotten pretty consistent with my diet and grooming, and without wanting to sound conceited, right now I'm easily the best-looking I've ever been. I'm getting attention and flirtatious comments from strangers in a way that has really never happened to me before, and family and friends have remarked on how much I've \"glowed up\", but if anything it makes me feel even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love her so much, and there are so many things about our relationship that I cherish, but the longer this goes on the more I worry it will never change. The lack of effort she makes with herself makes me feel rejected and taken for granted, and her lack of enthusiasm around sex makes me worry if she's still physically attracted to me at all. I've tried to gently broach the topic, and I really try to encourage her when she does make an effort, but it hasn't made any difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "To preempt some obvious comments: I don't think this is a mental health thing - by all accounts she's doing better now than she was when we first started going out. She has a less stressful and better paid job, we have a better circle of friends, and we have a beautiful home together. I remember having to regularly support her emotionally around work and friendship/flatmate drama in the first year or so of dating, and I still happily would, of course, but it seems like things are just a lot better in that respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hoping this doesn't all sound shallow and superficial. She deserves someone who makes the effort for her, and so do I. We're coming up on our 5 year anniversary in a few month's time, and I'm honestly starting to get really scared. I don't want to break up with her, but truthfully it makes me feel so unappreciated, and it hurts.\n",

      "How do I get her to understand that this is damaging our relationship without hurting her feelings?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tldr; I love my girlfriend but I feel like she's given up on her appearance, and stopped appreciating mine too.\n",

      "Body text: Thank you for reading if you’re here 🥲\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background: I’m 26F, living with my fiancé (28M) about an hour north of my mom. We recently bought a 3-bedroom house we’ve been remodeling ourselves. It’s still a work in progress—one room doesn’t even have drywall or flooring yet and is currently being used to store our tools and paint. Our bedroom is finished, but the guest room doesn’t even have a door yet (we still need to buy them) and is also doubling as a storage space. We live with our three cats. My little sister is 14F, and is about to graduate from 8th grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto my mom. She’s a pathological liar. It’s something I’ve tolerated for years because most of her lies are small and don’t cause major harm. But it still bothers everyone who knows her—she lies constantly, doubles down when questioned, and ends conversations instead of owning up to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, her lying became a serious issue. She was kicked out of the house where my sisters and I grew up, but she told everyone she had sold it voluntarily. She assured us she had somewhere to go. She didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I called her to check in during her “move,” she was panicked and said she needed help moving a U-Haul and her car. I rushed over after work and found the house in a terrible state—completely unprepared, dirty, and filled with trash bags. There was grime all over the floor, a fridge that looked like it hadn’t worked in years, and everything that couldn’t be moved alone was simply left behind: her bedroom set, my childhood room, my sister’s belongings—years of memories just abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She admitted she had nowhere to go. I did the only thing I could think of: I got her into one of the apartments owned by the company I worked for. I signed the lease myself, put it under my name, and paid the full deposit and rent out of pocket, knowing I wouldn’t see that money again. I even risked my job to get her off the street. She had just $40K coming in from the sale of the house but wouldn’t receive it for a few more days. She was in her car with my 12-year-old sister and their two dogs (a 5 lb chihuahua and a 200 lb mastiff), with nowhere to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister didn’t even know they were moving. When I picked her up, she was confused and asked if they were just going to check out a new place. My mom lied directly to her face and said they had just bought a new house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, my mom repaid me for the apartment, but she then moved into a rental house for $2,600/month—completely unaffordable. I begged her not to. I hated watching her spend what little money she had furnishing the entire place from scratch, but she ignored me. She bought everything new—beds, couches, TVs, pillows, blankets—all to replace the things she left behind. I hoped she could stabilize in 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to yesterday: I get a call from my mom. She has to be out of her rental by midnight. She claims she’s been paying rent but her landlord wasn’t paying the mortgage and the house is being reclaimed. She’s scrambling to move everything into a U-Haul. Once again, my sister knows nothing. My mom told my sister (WHILE SHE WAS MOVING HER SHIT INTO A UHAUL) that she would  leave the apartment unlocked so my sister and I could grab clothes for her dad’s house over the weekend. I ended up having to be the one to break the news: “Mom got kicked out. Everything is in a storage unit now.” My sister was devastated, unsure why my mom couldn’t be honest with her. My sister asked me if my mom had bothered to pack her bed. It makes me cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have the resources to help this time. I can’t house her, especially with the mastiff. We’re financially stretched thin from the remodel. My fiancé and I both work full-time and aren’t home during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister is heartbroken. She’s supposed to go on a weeklong school trip to DC on Tuesday. My mom promised to drive her and her friend to the school that day. Now we’re not even sure if her things were packed or left behind again. Had we known what was happening, we could’ve at least made sure she brought her essentials to her dad’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m just at a complete loss. My mom lies so much I never know what’s real. I know the obvious answer is “don’t believe anything,” but how am I supposed to help someone like that? I have nothing left to give, but I hate watching my sister go through this. I’m heartbroken and disappointed beyond words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to be honest, refuses to take accountability, and seems to believe that if she ignores her problems long enough, a miracle will fix them. But no miracle comes. And now my little sister, once again, is the one suffering the consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR my mom has lied about her situation until she’s literally in dire need of help, losing all of her possessions and living in her car. My little sister is losing everything she owns, and my mom will not have a rational conversation or come to terms with her situation. Can I do anything to help? \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT TO ADD: my sister stays with me every other weekend, just to hang out and spend time together. She’s sleeping in my guest room right now, and I’m meeting her dad tonight so she can spend the rest of the week at his house. \n",

Then I jokingly asked “Did you do something funny with that girl?” And man…in that moment I’ve seen the life getting out of her and I knew it. She then confessed everything..that they were just friends and at the start of march she started to have feelings for her and they were intimate from the first days (this started before our 5th anniversary) and it kept going until she came back home. On the last night there she got herself drunk just because she was leaving that place. Also, she told me that when I proposed to her that she was scared and she started to think if she has attachment issues because she feels she couldn’t be with anyone forever because maybe that’s how she is as a person. \n",

      "At this moment I’m a complete mess..she suggesed to go to therapy together and we did our first session and she said that she forgot half of what it was discussed there and even if we are scheduled for the 2nd I don’t know what to say. After I found out she started to be cold in my presence. We are talking, maybe even laughing a little but not touching, kissing, anything. She started a little bit to get touchy like holding hands outside or a little hug, but a kiss maybe a veery very small one. \n",
      "\n",
      "The breakdown? Yesterday evening before bed I heard her phone pop up and it was that girl. She said they were not talking anymore but here we are. The most f’up part? She told me that she misses her and she’s thinking daily about her and what she’s doing. How can you tell your fiancee and bf of 5 years that you miss the person you cheated with? Because she cheated also emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to sleep but I couldn’t. I went to the kitchen to smoke (4months without ciggarettes until she told me) and I started to feel my heart pounding out of my chest like I was going to have a heart attack. It hurt so much and I don’t know if it also hurt physically but I don’t know if I ever felt that pain. In the end I managed to fall asleep trying to calm myself to understand that the pain is not real and it’s just mentally. \n",

I loved and love this girl with all my heart and she made me feel something that no one else could and I want to make things fine, but I’m not so sure about her. She looks like at a point she would try with baby-steps and in another that ca’t get past what happened. \n",

      "\n",
      "He's 30s M, I'm 30s F. Together over 10 years. One teenager. Dogs/cats in home. He's an on call worker. He is supposed to be on call Sunday night to Friday night, unless coverage is needed on weekends. Sometimes he gets multiple calls a day, rarely none in a week. Sometimes he is out of the house all day, sometimes just an hour. I do a regular 40 hour work week, plus do his job with him casually on the evenings and weekends if coverage is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week he was gone for a work retreat all week. Lots of fun and dicking around and lots of planning/paperwork stuff. I held the fort. He'd been on call before this for about 10 days straight. He came back, and I went on call with him for the weekend. We spent a lot of time together that weekend both working and at home. He is on call until this Friday. He has basically been on call for 3 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he is home, he spends a lot of time on the computer. When he is off call, he does not really want to do anything other than get groceries. He does not really want to leave the house to go for walks. He likes doing his in-house hobbies, which are mostly either solitary or are things that don't rock my world. To be vague, he likes playing music, gaming, watching TV. I don't like watching TV but I do it to be with him. I watched sports with him all weekend to hang out. Our gaming interests are pretty opposite. I really like walking and being outside. I am the primary person who works with our dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like going and playing board games in a group too. I go maybe every 3 weeks, or less. This is pretty much the only outside-the-house \"my friend\" stuff that I'm doing currently. I wanted to go tomorrow. He got pretty upset today when I told him I was going. He wanted to spend time together now that he is off work for the first time in forever. I feel like we have spent the whole week together and it's been mostly me sitting around and feeling burned out while he games. I went to work with him last weekend specifically because I missed him when he was gone. I tried to express that to him but he says I'm ignoring and invalidating his feelings basically, and maybe I am. He is very upset with me and says I should just go to the game night, but also that he is hurt, disappointed, angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so burned out from my stressful job and doing the same old 65% of the around the house duties that I always do and that he tells me doesn't have to be done. I do 3miles a day walking AT LEAST with all these dogs, who I love, but who were his choice, then I hit the gym because it's one of the only things I know -I- like doing. The kid, his choice. The things we do together, his choice/his hobbies. I don't know who \"me\" is sometimes. I don't know how to express this in a way that isn't hurtful to him. I don't know if I'm rational, I don't know if I'm right or wrong. I'm burned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot to our relationship, I love him, it's been many years. I'm just expressing the bad stuff now. I guess - feelings aren't wrong - I'm not looking for everyone to say he's wrong. I don't think he's wrong for feeling this way. But it doesn't feel fair to hold it against me. I just wanted to have fun. The guy hates board games, lol. I want to have fun and do something I like... \n",

      "Body text: **TL;DR (33M) with (35F) girlfriend of 4 years. Gave up PhD for our relationship. Still jobless 8 months later. She’s emotionally drained and gave me an ultimatum: get a job offer this week or move out. Unsure if this relationship is still salvageable. We share the same long-term goals, but I’m currently unable to give her the short-term stability she needs. Looking for advice on whether to stay or go when love is there but timing feels off.**\n",
      "\n",
      "My (33M) girlfriend (35F) and I have reached a critical point after 4 years together. We met when I was a Master's student and continued as I began a PhD in statistics. During my second year, she gave me an ultimatum—either her or the PhD. She was tired of being a successful healthcare provider earning a good income while I was a 30-year-old grad student surviving on $30k a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I truly believed in our relationship and had doubts about pursuing an academic career, given today’s job market. So, I left with a Master's degree. I felt confident about transitioning to industry after speaking with friends in tech, who convinced me I'd easily secure an entry-level data role. Unfortunately, that turned out to be incorrect, and after eight months of job searching, I'm still unemployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time, my partner has expressed dissatisfaction watching her friends marry, buy houses, and have children while we couldn't move forward. Our love has sustained us through these struggles, but her unhappiness gradually intensified. Over the past months, it became clear she was deeply depressed. I encouraged her to seek professional help, and although she initially seemed open, she ultimately declined due to the cost, despite being able to afford it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month, things worsened significantly. She struggled to sleep and frequently burst into tears. Neither of us fully understood if our relationship was causing her depression or if the relationship issues were symptoms of it. Our good times became less frequent as her depressive episodes grew closer and more intense.\n",
      "\n",

      "I genuinely understand her perspective and don't judge her, but maybe reaching this point means a fresh start is best. However, we rarely fought aside from issues surrounding my inability to contribute financially toward our future.\n",

      "Currently, I tutor part-time, making about $1500-2000/month. I have a friend looking for an apartment, but two-bedroom rentals here start at $2000/month, which might be unaffordable. Alternatively, I could move back with my parents several hours away, but I'd lose my tutoring income, which requires me to be local.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have an interview for a promising government job in early June, but it could be months before that materializes, if at all.

      "Body text: I ‘35M’ find myself in a tough spot. I’ve been seeing this woman ‘33F’ for about 7 months. We had both had come out of long term relationships and we both agreed to take things slow and not to label anything. Inevitably we both caught feelings and while I’ve asked her to make things official she’s told me on several occasions that while she enjoys spending time with me she does not want to commit because of my communication skills. To her credit I did have some problematic behaviors that I have since addressed and made major improvements. I’ve been in therapy, have learned how to communicate, such as not making assumptions, asking clarifying questions, not raising my voice, giving each other space when things get heated. I’ve also learned how to regulate my emotions and so on. While my behavior isn’t perfect, I’ve come a very long way. She on the other had had a difficult time accepting that she has resorted to some problematic behaviors such as defensiveness, deflection, resorting to sarcasm and teasing when I’m trying to have serious conversions. I’ve tried to address this with her and it hasn’t been very easy. She also lacks accountability a lot of the time. So when she puts it on me as for the reason being my lack of communication skills that she doesn’t want to commit it feels like a slap in the face. I told her I was heart broken but that I accepted it and thanked her for the honesty and told her I can no longer continue things and wished her the best. The next day she texts me trying to explain herself that she didn’t appreciate that I’ve called her avoidant and cruel (although I stop doing so months ago after she voiced that out). She also said that she always felt like she could never meet the level of affection that I wanted. I responded by letting her know that her level of affection was never an issue, I validated her feeling and the position I put her in while navigating my previous toxic behaviors but that I could not longer stay in this and keep hiding our relationship. She kept saying that I wanted to go from 0 to 100, it honestly felt like I was being gaslit. She was bothered that I wasn’t telling ppl that I was seeing someone but I explained to her that I didn’t want to because she was always very hot and cold with me and that I didn’t want to ruin her image before we even commit to each other. She then tells me she’s sick and like a dumbass I offer to come over and take care of her which she agreed to. And now it’s back to how things were before. The reality is that I cannot do this anymore. I feel like a placeholder and just plain being used. I just don’t know what to do. Can someone please give me some advice on how to leave this toxic situation. Thank you.\n",

      "Body text: I guess I am one of the new fencers and would love to get your thoughts, maybe a help to think in some direction. To give you a context: Me, F(32) and my BF (33) have been together for 2 years, in a very committed relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A bit about my bf:** He is an amazing person, very kind, calm and caring, especially to me. He is an introvert and never was into parties/crazy lifestyle. I'm also introvert, but more active and social. Since he moved in with me, he has become even more thoughtful and considerate. Sometimes I think that every day he learns something new, observes me so he can make me happier in what he does. He is a very chill person though and he wants to continue having this kind of lifestyle: work, his hobby (investments, learning) and traveling with me. BTW, he has become a bit more active after meeting me: started going to gym, doing more outdoors activities or cultural events. Things that he said about. that he would never do, he actually he quite enjoys now with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember on our first date, he mentioned that he would discuss having a kind even adopting with his partner - this quite stuck in my mind as I thought he was happy to have kids. On our first year, I brought the topic of having kids and he said he didn't know, at that moment he wasn't ready and maybe in the future this would change. We spoke about it again after some time, the answer was the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons he mentions are: I never thought about it, I had never had a pressure from my family to have kids. I want to have flexibility and time to do things whenever we want to - eg simple things (Walking, brunch, traveling etc). He would come a bit defensive if I'd push - I've noticed that he is defensive or gets a bit emotional, when he discusses the topics about religion, or the things that in his society people would prescribe to everyone as a written rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked him what is the purpose of your life, he said that it's me. That felt good, but on the other side, I felt extremely anxious when he said that he doesn't want to give me a fake hope and he wants me to be happy. So, I should do whatever I feel it right to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, I am torn because up until 2 years ago, I was living with the mindset - work, family and having kids. Never in my 20s any woman said to me that they didn't want to have kids. Maybe only oce I heard it and I was shocked - \"how a woman would not want to have kids?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was never considering this to be an option, and now when I see that as a possibility it confuses even more. I do have a social pressure from my culture, friends there but also, if you'd give me a kid now, I would obviously do anything for them, but I think I have become too lazy or always tired even to take care of myself.. Although I have a fear that in 40s I would lose interest in things, resent my partner and regret not having kids as I would not have this experience of being a mum.\n",

      "**TL;DR:** My boyfriend wants chill life, doesn't want to complicate it with having kids. He wants to keep enjoying it with me. I am baffled and not sure what to do - breaking up with him is the worst nightmare I could have. I sometimes think, maybe it's not a bad idea to have the life for yourself, but the social pressure and the way I was raised impacts my thought process a lot. Also, sometimes I am stuck of not having a purpose in life (I don't want to have kids just for that sake though). Anyone to share anything to help me with this dilemma?

      "Body text: Hi, I 19f, and my bf 20m have been dating for three years, we moved in together around a year ago. Before that we were mostly long distance. About a year into the relationship he told me that he didn't love me anymore, he said \"you get in my way of living the life I want to have\" so we broke up for a few months. Eventually we got back together and talked it out. He claims that he was being emotional and he didn't mean what he said, and things went back to normal for the most part. But ever since then I've had this nagging feeling in my gut that he really doesn't love, and this year I feel really proved my point. \n",
      "\n",
      "we argue almost daily now, I'm usually the one starting them because he would go against my wishes constantly, for example he loves hanging out with his friend, perfectly normal, I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is the way that he'll say \"I'll be back in an hour\" then drive across the city, for hours. No texts, no calls, nothing. Then he'll get back home, ignore me for at least a couple more hours to play video games, then finally get into bed and ignore me once again to turn into the corner and just watch Instagram till he falls asleep. Mind you this is almost every single night, and every single day he would ignore me at least once.\n",
      "\n",
      "his from of ignoring me is, 1. No reply when I say something or ask a question. I can ask over and over and there won't be a response, I can get closer or louder and it's the same thing. i know he hears me because this man can hear a spoon drop from the other side of the apartment, so I don't know why he won't respond to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. We will constantly go over my boundaries, I'm talking, multiple times a day where I have to remind him to be nice to me, it's like I have to re teach him that I'm a human with human emotions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know a little more about me and him I'll tell you about what made me write here. We had an argument a day or 2 ago, in this argument after he left for his family's place for a few days. I told him I was upset because he would play games with this family member, he would make jokes with him, he would cry on his shoulder, he would constantly talk to him for hours when he can only talk to me for 20 minutes before he just starts to ignore me again. I told him this and after a few minutes of me trying to tell him how much it hurt to see him act the way I've been begging him to act for the past year, and see him do it so easily too, I laughed and said something along the lines of \"I beg you to talk to me and you act like it's impossible for you\" I laughed a little and he mocked my laugh (something I have repeatedly told him not to do, I had an abusive father that would do that to taunt me the majority of my life, he's heard me cry over it so he knows how It would make me feel)\n",
      "\n",

      "Body text: I’m 29M.. my girlfriend is 38F. We’ve been together for two and a half years and honestly, it’s been amazing. Peaceful, grounded, mature. I’ve never felt more comfortable in a relationship. We don’t live together.. we have our own spaces, our own lives, and when we’re together, we’re fully present. I’m focused on growing my business, she’s independent, and there’s a really healthy balance. No drama… just genuinely a lot of love and a great time.\n",

      "But here’s the thing: she doesn’t want kids. She made that clear early on, but at the time, I didn’t take it too seriously.

So tonight my boyfriend (of two years) got really sad out of nowhere and after I asked some questions, he admitted that he doesn’t feel like we’re as connected as he wants us to be.

      "Title: Wife choosing hobbies over family\n",
      "Body text: My wife(36 woman) and I(37 male) started running 3 nights a week for like 15 minutes. We would run together so it was a fun, healthy hobby to do together. She then got real good and started running 30 minutes. She would leave me in the dust. I tried to keep up, but can only go for about 20 minutes because of my knee and back problems. Then she joined a running club and now she runs every night, an hour or more after work. She runs way faster then me, so it isn't really together. We work opposite schedules, so the only time we really get together is after one of us gets off work. She spends an hour to 2 of that running. She then runs \"long runs\" while I am at work, like 7 miles. We have a 3 yr old and a 10 year old that I take care of 4 days a week. I feel like she is kinda neglecting the kids because of this hobbie. I don't want to leave the kids to run every night, as I feel there is more important things we could be doing with them. Running gets super boring and I'd like to do more fun things as a family. Anytime I ask her to try to limit her runs, when we are together, to 30 minutes, she pretty much screams in my face about how I'm trying to control her. Brutal fights where I feel beat down and pathetic for asking for her attention. This happens in front of the kids. I try to explain that she has 2 kids and a husband that need her. She also crochets when she isn't running, so that takes up a lot of her time. She does that for an hour every night too. I'm so fed up and upset that she doesn't care about my emotions. We have been together for 18 years and I feel so alone in life. I am growing resentful and depressed. I am afraid it is going to hurt our children. What the heck do I do? \n",

      "Body text: I wouldn't know for sure if I should label my girlfriend (22F) as \"emotionally dependent,\" but I don’t have a better term, so I apologize. She’s a very jealous person, and her constant phrases like “I couldn’t live without you” have me genuinely worried. She’s gone through very difficult situations in her life, and I partly understand why she is the way she is.

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been together for a while (4 years), and we usually spend weekends together. He’s the go-to handyman in his family, so it’s common for them to ask him to do things on weekends. Normally, he tells them he’ll check with me first, then calls to see if we have any plans. I almost always say it’s fine unless we’ve got something already set. I do the same with him when things come up on my side (things just don’t come up as often).

      "2.\t⁠Since moving in together, it almost feels like the relationship has declined. We have a generally productive routine together but we feel disconnected. We both take care of her dog together and generally share the load on home duties and financial needs. We share some hobbies but not all.\n",
      "3.\t⁠We almost called it quits a few times in the past 8 months. We decided to start couples counselling and as of 3 months ago. It’s been going well for the most part and helping us to unpack some of our bigger issues. However I think we both still feel disconnected. Doing things together now almost feels strained and less enjoyable than it used to be. I’m hopeful things will improve.\n",
      "4.\t⁠There has been considerable emotional stress and strain in the relationship. Of both of us not having their needs met and a lot of heavy life transitions.\n",
      "5.\t⁠We’re both now at great spots in our lives in terms of financial freedom. Either of us could live on our own and be fine. You would think this would be a recipe for success.\n",
      "6.\t⁠We know each others families well, and generally are accepted by each others families.\n",
      "7.\t⁠I am a white man and she is a black Caribbean woman so there are definitely cultural differences.\n",
      "8.\t⁠I proposed to her 6 months ago to which she explained she didn’t feel we were ready. I respected her decision and here we are. We both come from divorced parents so marriage does not come lightly to us. \n",
      "9.\t⁠At age 31, I do feel a time pressure here. I’d like to have a family in the next 2-5 years and so I’m stressed about whether this relationship will work or not or if I’m wasting time.\n",
      "10.\t⁠I’m hopeful this rough patch with only bring us closer together. Alas, only time will tell.\n",
      "11. The sex life has been non existent for about 6 months now. I raise it as a concern and try to initiate but she continues to refrain saying she’s not feeling it. To me this is a big red flag. \n",

      "Title: My [26F] relationship with my boyfriend [26M] is not getting anywhere. It’s been 6 years. How do I move forward either with or without him?\n",
      "Body text: TDLR: I’ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years. I wrote a list of pros and cons but I’m just so scared of failing this relationship. I need advice on how to move forward or how to better encourage him to change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, longtime lurker. Just reaching out because I need advice. I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost 6 years now. We both work in the same field, which is demanding of our bodies, time, and effort. We met in college and started dating sophomore year. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re at the stage now where everyone asks us every five minutes when we are getting engaged. Since I’m the girl, I get asked often why he’s not committing and “where’s your ring?” etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I want it. I want the whole life with him. But I’m not ready for it. I’m trying to protect myself. I think I’m rambling, but here is a list: \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: He’s a good guy. He has strong values. We like similar things like working out, trying new foods, etc. He has a nice family. They seem to like me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "- Im significantly more outgoing than he is. I’m always trying to accomplish something. He could spend his entire life at home after work doing nothing and be satisfied with the way things are. I want to achieve. \n",
      "- He does not defend me against other people. I have 4 separate examples where 4 different people disrespected me, and he did not have my back. We talked about each instance and he acknowledged it and said it wouldn’t happen again, but it seems like each instance was like a completely new experience for him. Like, just have my back man. \n",
      "- He always farts on or around me. I know farting is natural and all, but he thinks it’s funny to just keep letting them out around me even though I have very clearly told him that it is not for me. \n",
      "- He has anger issues. He gets road rage easier than anyone else I know. It’s scary because it makes me feel like he will rage and then get us into a car accident. If he stubs his toe, he shouts really loud and swears a lot and it’s scary. \n",
      "- He doesn’t plan anything. We started dating in October, and even before then 6 years ago, I planned to get him a watch that he wanted for awhile. For my Christmas present, he got me some chocolate and forgot to buy the “main thing” (a bobble head), and placed the order on Christmas Eve. He’s never planned a date. Or anything. \n",
      "- He wants to get married but does LITERALLY NOTHING to get there?\n",
      "- He only does things when prompted. We get into an argument every 2 weeks because I’m just begging him to plan something. He plans a date that’s almost exactly the same as anything I’ve ever planned before, so really there’s no planning involved. So he doesn’t plan anything for our relationship. He doesn’t plan out the future for us either. He says that he only sees it with me, which I believe he does, but that’s because I’m a go-getter and he can sit back and have a good life. \n",
      "- I don’t trust him. His word means nothing to him and I tell him this often. He just becomes mute, nods, or says he understands why I don’t. He lies to me a lot. We were at a baseball game and he went to go grab a beer. I asked him to ask the bartender for a glass of water if it was free. He came back without water and I asked if they had it and he said no, they didn’t. I had a gut feeling, so I asked him if he even asked. He admitted that he didn’t. I know this is a small lie, but one of the big issues for us right now is that I can’t trust him. Another previous example was when he was in a class, and a girl who is really mean to me was actually sitting pretty much right next to him. I knew she was in his class. Every thing he said about the class, he just omitted that key detail. I finally figured it out and asked him, and he admitted to purposefully leaving her out of his class stories. \n",
      "- His older brother just got married at a really expensive resort overseas. I was so excited to go. His parents offered to pay for the room, so I only had to pay for the plane ticket (that was still $800 which to me is still a lot). I decided I didn’t want to go based on principal that I didn’t trust him, but I wanted to go so badly. We fought a lot and he said he really didn’t want to go alone. I ended up going and I had a great time, but I keep regretting going. \n",
      "- He’s inconsistent. We have an argument pretty much every 2 weeks where I tell him exactly what I need: more effort in planning for us, meetings each month to discuss US and our budget, time, plans, whatever. He does not ever follow through. \n",
      "- He has no goals. I have to push him so hard to branch out. He just says broad things like “yeah I want to go into project management” like what have you done to get there? What does that even mean to you? He has no hobbies. \n",
      "- He and I graduated from a pretty good college. I know he’s smart. But he spends all his free time brain rotting on instagram. \n",
      "- He doesn’t take care of me on his own. He only does that when I ask him to or when he knows he’s done something wrong. And then he makes these large declarations about how he doesn’t deserve me and how I’m so great, and it’s like ?? Why can’t you treat me that way though?\n",
      "- He gives me absolute BS all the time. He can’t critically think for himself even though his job requires it and he thinks he can. He likes to brute force his way through things. I tell him not to BS me. And he just continues to do so.\n",
      "- We’re in the same profession, but I do my best not to make it my life. I have a ton of other hobbies, but all he does is talk about his job. And from the sound of it (we get paid the exact same), he’s not very good at it. It’s male dominated, so I feel like he wants to be better, but I would not want to work with him based on his description of how he works. \n",
      "- I’ve asked him to go to therapy. Again, he’s not consistent. He just said he would talk to a pastor from home too which is fine, but I’m 100% sure that never happened. \n",
      "- He has really bad stomach problems, likely due to IBS, but he doesn’t do anything about it. We are in a job profession that requires us to be physically fit and he’s not unfit, but he eats unhealthy. He’s not consistent with a diet. He uses so many condiments on his food that (from his words, growing up as a fat kid) are crushing his cholesterol and making his stomach problems worse. But his stomach problems always seem to be exacerbated when we’re about to do something together that he doesn’t want to do but I do, like going to garage sales together. \n",
      "- He keeps claiming that our problems only arise because we have different love languages. his only love language is physical touch. Maybe words of affirmation. But I feel disgusted when he touches me and why would I affirm his actions if he’s always lying to me and being inconsistent? \n",
      "- He has a bad attitude all the time. And when I point it out, he says “no, I don’t!”. Like ok, what do I do with that? He’s a Debbie downer on everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, it’s almost been 6 years. I feel like I’ve suffered through heartbreak for 4/6 of these years. But I feel like I can’t leave because my whole family (and his) would be so disappointed/mad at me and also I would feel like such a failure. I take really good care of him. I’m always thinking about him, and us, and our future. I feel let down all the time. I don’t even know what I’m asking for, but I just need help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other details:\n",
      "- we live together with another roommate\n",
      "- I own the house and bought it a few years ago by myself. He pays me rent and has his own room \n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months now, but we’ve been essentially\n",
      "living together for a good portion of that so i’d say we’re a lot closer than most people at this timeframe. About a month ago, i talked to her about how I was uncomfortable with her conversations with one of her guy friends, since they always primarily revolved around sex. Things like how he wanted to hookup with her friends, talking about girls he had had sex with, and how horny he was. Even as far as sharing details like that he just shaved down there. I thought this was crossing a line, and she got a bit defensive about it saying that that’s just what they talked about, but did agree to talk to him to tone it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week ago, i discover that nothing changed, at all. We have a fight about it, and she basically said that she didn’t want to ‘start a thing’ by bringing it up to him again or shutting it down. She did agree with me that it was crossing a line and was disrespectful, she talked to him again, and that was that. Today, she had a dinner planned with him and her two best friends (girls). Before this, me and her had plans to hangout or go study or just do something together. Instead of this, she decides to take a nap in my room and sets an alarm, not to spend time with me, but to wake up for the dinner. When her alarm goes off, she doesn’t respond so I wake her up and tell her, she turns it off and goes back to sleep. I wake her up again after 20 minutes, and she seems visibly upset on the way there. She says that she’s a bit upset she’s late, but I can tell that’s not all of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why, when she’s feeling this upset about something and won’t talk to me, she instead wants to go have dinner with a guy who she knows i’m uncomfortable with and is an active point of argument in our relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t even want to bring up that this made me upset because I don’t want to start a fight, and i’m not sure if there’s a good way to talk about it without starting one.\n",

      "Body text: I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 5 years — we started dating in high school. I’ve stayed because I really loved him and kept hoping things would get better. But honestly, he’s never been caring, supportive, or thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I got a great internship that I worked really hard for. It starts in a week, and when I brought it up again, he said, “Doesn’t it start next month?” and didn’t even remember the name of the company. That was a big moment for me, and he treated it like it was nothing. It really hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just one example. He rarely shows any genuine interest in my life or emotions. When he’s in a good mood, he can be nice — but that version of him only shows up about 15–20% of the time. The rest of the time, I feel emotionally alone in the relationship.\n",

      "Title: Father doesn't financially support me, yet wants my time and attention\n",
      "Body text: I (20F) am going into my senior year of college next semester and haven't really talked to my father(M58) in about a year. Because last summer, I found out he gave my cat to the neighbors, who proceeded to neglect him, but it was really just the final nail in the coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wasn't around much when I was very young since he was in the military, but I at least looked forward to seeing him. We've been growing apart since he remarried when I was around 10 when we kind of just stopped doing things together, DnD was no longer fun if we even did it because my step mother(F38) went to bed earlier or was a sore player and he insisted on her playing, we never went to the creek anymore, lots of broken promises abut doing stuff together, he started making fun of me for how I walk, being a no it all (what kid doesn't like sharing fun facts they learned) sided with my step mother when she asked if the reason my nose had a bump was because it was broken and I got mad at her, even their roommate sided with me when he accused me of faking being sick (she worked in health care I forget as what), made fun of me for not shaving my legs, let his friends kid destroy my legos when I wasn't there, you get it, he wasn't there for me emotionally or physically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other finishing move, which I wonder if I'm wrong for, occurred last summer before the cat. My mother lost her job, and I asked him to pay for just my food, and asked for $200 a week. If that seems like a lot for a college student, I am 5'9\", do manual labour at work, where I volunteer, and on my off days, go to the gym. I am also trying to gain weight to join the military, as I am underweight. He said no. I was not eligible for food stamps where I live, as you need to work 20 hours a week, and I have a substantial amount of savings for medical school, $100,000. I was working off the books as a dog walker, on the books in the school greenhouse, and as a lice technician. I was also taking organic chem and two other easier classes, along with volunteering in hospice, errand services, the ER, and a cat cafe by my school over the summer. I am pre-med, and NEED to get good grades in my classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, at this point I thought back on if my father had financially supported me at all and realized he hadn't, my mother pays all my bills currently, and he didn't even like feeding me when I visited him and said we would have to discuss rent if I lived with him or in my grandmothers, empty house. He doesn't pay my tuition, but he did help me get a no-interest loan, cosigned my other loan with interest, and helped me get a scholarship. However, I consider the scholarship a wash since he took so long to get me his taxes, and I missed out on other scholarships. He makes $300,000 a year. We are in family therapy now, and he wants me to talk with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I am no longer speaking to my father for a variety of reasons; he wasn't there for me emotionally, physically, or financially. The final nail in the coffin was him saying no to feeding me and giving away my cat. How do I get him to financially support me? Or if not possible, leave me alone? \n",

      "However over the past 3 years, I think the stress of kids and also geo political issues which are hard to see in the news constantly have had a real effect on my wife. It's like the light in her life is gone. She'll openly admit that she sees the world differently and just isn't the same anymore. I find this really sad. The worst thing about it though is that I really feel she's taking it out on me. As I said before, i'm no angel- but i'm a good husband and a good dad, but I just feel like I can't do anything right.

The problem is I have been open from fairly early in our relationship about my insecurities about my physical appearance. Growing up a chubby kid in public school in Arkansas had its challenges.

      "TLDR: My partner (28F) and I (28M) have been together for eight years, lived together for seven years. I am having serious doubts about the relationship but am very avoidant and don't know how to bring this up with her. She seems content despite our ongoing issues and would be completely blindsided.\n",

      "I love my partner so much but have recently been having serious doubts about the future of our relationship, I feel so guilty for feeling this way and don't know what to do. Most of the things I'm feeling doubt over have been issues for a while but recently it feels like a switch has been flipped and I'm suddenly very aware of them all and worried:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We still get along but feel more like roommates than lovers. I have never been the most romantic person but lately it feels like we act more like roommates than partners in a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I have been chronically depressed for about three years, I have no real drive or ambition and feeling pretty checked out of life most of the time. I have been in treatment for my mental health but things aren't improving. I know that my low mood and lack of motivation bothers my partner (she has always been much more driven and ambitious than me, even before my mental health took a hit). \n",
      "\n",
      "3. When I think about the future I feel uncertain and anxious. Throughout my 20s I have been really unsure about whether I'd eventually want children. Now that im approaching 30 I still feel really uncertain (in part because I feel like my mental health struggles would make an unstable parent). I guess I assumed I wouod eventually find clarity on this but it hasn't happened yet. My partner is not in a rush to start a family soon, but I know that she is much more confident that this is something she wants, and I keep thinking that she deserves a partner definitely on the same page about that. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. We have had a dead bedroom for over a year. This is definitely my fault. I have always had a low libido and throughout our relationship we've probably on average had sex about once a month. Again, maybe due to depression but for the last year or so my sex drive has been completely non-existent. I know this is another thing which bothers my partner and makes her feel ugly and undesirable. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. I worry about my partner a lot in ways which feel unhealthy. I sometimes feel like I have an overly protective or patronizing attitude towards her. She has struggled a lot with her health both mental and physically over the years, her family are not great and did a lot traumatize her as she was growing up. She can be very anxious and gets overwhelmed easily. I have spent a lot of time over the years taking on the role of protector or caretaker for her when she has been struggling. I worry that this has led me to treat her like she can't take care of herself at all and I'm holding her back from growth by always jumping in to take care of things for her. When I think about the relationship ending I am very sad but also I get really anxious at the thought of her having to fend for herself. I know this is a really patronizing way to feel but I can't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess overall I am realizing that my relationship has a lot of flaws which have gone unaddressed for a long time. I think about the future and I feel really uncertain and worry that we've stayed together more due to inertia than anything else. I don't know how to even begin to bring any of this up with my partner. I don't want to break up with her but I worry that some of these issues may not be fixable.\n",

      "Body text: We are college students and have been in a relationship for about 14 months now. about 6 months ago, my girlfriend made a new friend and they grew pretty close decently fast. they used to hang out a lot together, and do multiple projects together etc etc. I figured out the dude had a crush on her, but i trusted my girl 100% i brought this up to her in the past twice or thrice, but more or less she sort of disregarded it usually and gave her own reasons for it which sort of made sense, but to me things were clear that the dude was down bad.\n",

      "Title: My Girlfriend (F/22) cant seem to forgive me (M/22) for abandonment.\n",
      "Body text: Hey all, Having some deep issues within my relationship with my girlfriend of over 3 years. Our relationship had begun spiraling down within the second-year mark. Both of us noticed a slight shift in how we interacted, with me pulling back instinctively because I felt a shift. We didn't end up talking about it; she didn't bring it up, and I didn't either. I have a tendency to avoid conflict and sweep things under the rug when it comes to conflicts in all my relationships. I get an internship opportunity in a different state on the opposite side of the country. I ended up saying I would bring her out to see me while I was out there, but I was strapped for cash due to being lied to about pay for the internship. I never fulfilled what I said I was going to do, and during those 3 months that I left, she felt abandoned. She specifically let me know that she felt like she never had my attention and that she's always trying to catch me. We never started having these conversations until I came back home after the summer. I've been able to get back into my regular routine with my job and school while keeping my word and have more time for things. Since then, she's let me know that she no longer feels like she has to hunt me down, and things are looking better. However, she says she still has not forgiven me and is not sure if she can forgive me for the abandonment she felt. Due to that, she herself has kind of stepped back, but she is open to solutions and seeking professional help. Booked a session to see a therapist via Zoom next week.\n",

Besides him being borderline delusional that every dude who looks at me is someone I've dated, which is irritating and ruins the mood. He'll always make jokes that feel more serious than a joke until I call it out about me having a side dude and he'll even have me screenshare my messages on everything and screen record it to read back on them and see everything I say, which I have just completely given up talking to most people besides him due to this breach of privacy. Yes, I've talked to him about it and he limits doing it now, but still does it. He's very insecure from his past relationships. To top it off, he almost constantly asks me to buy him food or lyfts. In which he barley reciprocates doing the same for me as he spends all of his money typically on silly stuff. Not to mention, I've been through bad stuff sexually in the past and sometimes due to being triggered, he will be salty if I say I'm not in the mood for sexual stuff. He'll typically guilt trip me saying I don't find him attractive anymore, etc. I don't even look forward to calls anymore because it feels like a booty call or him wanting me to spend money on him. I love him a lot, but I'm becoming unsure of that. He wants me to wait 2 years until we live together too. It feels like too long.\n",

      "The problem is my father always need a billion explanations whenever we turn down one of his invitations. 2 years ago my brother turned him down and was buried with questions asking why he didn't want to come.

      "A few days ago, I hit my head on the pavement after taking a fall. This is right in the middle of finals, whereas I am supposed to be graduating this semester. I finally decide to go to the doctor today because I have a headache and my vision is a little blurry. I go to the school doctor, which then tells me to go to the ER because symptoms are worrisome. The school doctor doesn’t let me leave the building without somebody coming to get me. Obviously, I call my boyfriend who lives with me, to come and get me. The only problem with that is that he was blacked out drunk so I had to call my other friend. This friend gets my boyfriend in his car and takes us to the hospital. All three of us are waiting in the waiting room and my boyfriend leaves. Apparently he went in the parking lot and threw up a bunch. I’m waiting to get a CT scan and cannot deal with him. After I get my CT scan done and everything he gets back inside my other friend at this point has to leave, leaving me alone with my boyfriend. While we’re waiting, he starts getting aggressive calling me a beach, saying that this is a waste of his time, and generally just being rude to me. At this point I’m frustrated because he’s asking me the same questions over and over and my headache is not going away. I tell him to leave if he’s going to do that, but he says “no frick you I’m not gonna do that.” We finally get discharged, and on the way back he’s asking me the same questions again. When we get out of the Uber, I walk across the street to our apartment, and he just stays there. He leaves to go drink with his fraternity friends. And now I’m here alone at home with a huge headache and a concussion. \n",
      "The thing about this is that things like this I have happened before. I hit my head because I was trying to pick him off of the floor after he was blacked out and he left the apartment. He’s called me weak when I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression because he doesn’t believe in it. I’m just starting to hate him. I don’t want to. But it’s hard when somebody treats you like this, especially if you love them, and especially when they say they love you. \n",
      "I’m just tired and my head hurts. I don’t know what to do. He’s just hurt me so much and it’s obvious he doesn’t care about me. I guess I can’t beg him to love me, but I do still love him. When he’s sober, he treats me like a queen but when he’s drunk, his behavior is inexcusable. \n",

She wants to visit from her country with her new boyfriend, before our baby comes and everyone can meet each other before we're busy with a newborn. Partner considers it the right and kind thing to do to host them. I feel uncomfortable with it and suggest staying at hotel. He says that's rude and unacceptable for them to do that and instead would visit them in their country if that's the case. Visiting them in their country would be unfair for me seeing as we had to cancel a trip because of money \n",

      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'm (47 F) and am dating a new person (57 M). I've been alcohol free for 2yrs after a painful and contentious separation from my kid's dad that I tried to escape with alcohol  (I never had a good relationship with alcohol to begin with). I started dating someone 4 months ago who's in the process of a divorce and has been separated for 2 years. He's great. In therapy, really mindful, caring etc.. We've spent all of our free time together since our first date. He knows I don't drink and hasn't really ever asked me about it, but I did offer that I have a family history of addiction and don't want to pass it on to my son and he didn't have a ton of questions about that. When we hang out he'll have 1-2 beers at dinner which is not a big deal for me. He seems to be able to stop which is something I couldn't do.   \n",

Since then I've talked to him at night a few times where it sounds like he's had too much to drink. \n",

      "Even though I don't think he is remotely where I was when I drank, it's a trigger for me and I worry about someone numbing or avoiding real issues in the beginning of a relationship. Not sure if I should keep observing or say something and if I say something how do I approach it. \n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "TL;DR - feel like my bf (25M) is becoming too immature for me (20F) due to his lack of healthy habits, frivolous spending, lack of ambition and energy to do anything. He is a nice guy and can be generous, but is this enough when I’m becoming frustrated by his actions overall?\n",
      "\n",
      "My 25M bf and I 20F have been together for 2 years. He works full time and I am a full time law student who works part time (25-30 hours a week) and interns 8 hours a week at a firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for about two years, and whilst I do care about him, a number of ongoing issues have been weighing heavily on me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are justified.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start with, I have asthma, and he vapes — even after I’ve shared how concerned I am, both for my own health and his. Early on I expressed my concerns and he really limited it, and would go outside instead of sitting with me and vaping constantly. However, he doesn’t seem to be understanding how much it affects me, even at one point earlier in the relationship, my boyfriend actually joined in with my friends, encouraging me to try it, despite knowing my health issues. That moment stuck with me and has made me question how seriously he takes my health in general ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hygiene and attitude towards health also really frustrate me. I’m someone who goes to the dentist every six months, brushes twice a day, and sees a doctor when needed. He avoids the doctor entirely because he can’t be bothered, doesn’t brush his teeth regularly (which grosses me out), and laughs off my concerns when I bring it up. Since being with him, I’ve had recurring yeast infections that have made me dread intimacy, but he just thinks I’m being dramatic or overly anxious about health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, the relationship feels very one-sided. He lives 20 minutes away, but we rarely actually do anything together unless I initiate it. I invite him to family dinners every week, which he attends, but he never invites me to his, and we don’t do much socially. When we went on holiday with my family last year, I hoped he’d at least help with cooking or cleaning as my parents said he didn’t have to pay his share for the cabin we booked— but he didn’t, instead opting to spend 30 minutes in the car vaping before dinner was ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I buy gifts for his parents, yet he’s never done the same for mine, and last Christmas he asked me to buy my parents gifts on his behalf because he \"always forgets.\" This really annoys me because I feel guilty that my parents always make sure to invite him out and cook for him, but he can’t simply make effort in buying them a gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a well-paid job but poor financial habits — buying new, more expensive cars every year because he gets bored, and not handling his own bills or responsibilities. He still lives at home (which is fine as I do too) but has been quite sheltered; his parents do everything for him (cooking, cleaning, appointments, food shop) so it’s clear he hasn’t developed much independence. Meanwhile, I’m balancing my own adult responsibilities, exams, work, and life. I’m five years younger than him, yet I constantly feel like I’m lecturing someone who should be more mature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, even the small things he does just irritate me. He used to make a lot of empty promises and I addressed this with him, saying we couldn’t continue this way, which he listened to, but it’s hard to ignore how imbalanced things feel now with all these other things piling up. I feel like I’m really starting to check out of this relationship the more I see these behaviours.\n",

      "Body text: I (22F) have been dating my 1st yr med student bf (23M) for like 7 months and I am graduating soon and applying to medical school. I know I am not nearly as smart as he is and didn’t score as high on my MCAT but I am still applying and he has been aware of that since we met: he has been aware that I am graduating, applying to med school and have dreams of being a primary care physician and none of that has changed since we’ve been dating no matter how much he tries to convince me to give up or become an NP. Now that I’m graduating this has become a serious point of contention: where am I gonna be next year? For my gap year I can either live in the same city as him where I have no friends and no family except my younger sister who will be in university. I will probably have to work a job that pays less and find a new apartment unless I live with him. Or I can live at home (5 hr away by car) with my parents, work a job that pays much more and be with my family.\n",

He is here for his md for 4 years so he doesn’t have to give up anything but I do. I hesitate to live with him during my application cycle because he is not supportive of my application. He thinks I am too optimistic of medicine, that I am applying too early with a poor MCAT and weak application and because I want to do primary care I should “just become a PA or an NP” and because I don’t want to do that I am “brainwashed.” \n",

      "Help! What should I do? Is there a way to compromise if he doesn’t want to do long distance?

He’s the only man who has ever treated me with respect and kindness. The problem is there is no more spark. It feels like I’m living with my best friend. To be completely honest I don’t find him attractive anymore and I’m left very unsatisfied in the bedroom. So much so that it’s become a routine thing I do just to get it over with and please him.

      "Body text: I (31M) really like this woman (27F) I've been dating for a little over two months - she's incredibly blunt and funny and creative and I always enjoy our time together, we share values on religion and politics and even future family plans, and I'm unbelievably attracted to her. When we first started dating, our first kiss or two was a little awkward and I think we both wrote it off due to nerves, and it felt like our kisses/makeout sessions in the dates that followed improved and we were really feeling each other. Around our fourth or fifth date, we had a great night out with drinks and dinner and a show and we ended up back at her place, and things progressed to the bedroom not too long afterwards. It had been around a year since the last time I slept with anyone, and while we tipsily fooled around I couldn't keep my erection because I was too in my head about performance anxiety and the spontaneity of the moment and not using protection, and we ended up cuddling for a long time before I went home.\n",

In the past two weeks or so, I've noticed that our kissing just hasn't included tongue (despite me trying to get it involved like it had been in the past), and she hasn't reciprocated as much like straddling me or putting her hands on my chest or around my neck; last week she nervously mentioned something she didn't like about how we were kissing and I took it to note and tried to address it, but it kind of killed the mood and I went home not too long afterwards. I haven't had complaints about kissing or anything else bedroom-related in the past, and it really seemed like we were both enjoying ourselves earlier on in the first month or so we were dating, so I'm struggling to figure out how or where things went wrong and how to fix it. I'm not so egotistical to discard the idea that maybe I'm still just rusty as far as making out or physical escalation, but outside of that one moment she hasn't made any adjustments on her end or mentioned anything that's bugging her as far as us connecting physically and I obviously can't address any issues that I don't know exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't been particularly outspoken about these issues or made many overt moves to escalate things physically because our first time in the bedroom she shared that she has a medical condition(s) that would make intimacy difficult and even potentially one-sided, and even though I'm a little sexually frustrated and would love to really explore that aspect of our relationship a lot more, I don't want to put additional pressure on her for that specifically for something that's basically outside of her control. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think there's anything really significantly off about our relationship outside of the physical aspects - we text all the time sharing little details about our daily lives, the creative projects she's working on, my hobbies and the food I'm cooking, and anime we're watching; our conversations in person are lively and don't really have many dull moments and we've continued having fun on dates. Even though she's said she's not really a \"romantic\" person and tends to operate more on logic than emotions, I think the feeling is pretty mutual from her end because even if things are far as our relationship are kind of in a holding pattern (from my perspective) we keep scheduling time for each other in her limited time off from work and we've both talked about how we're dating with the intention of finding our life partner and having kids and stuff. I really like her and think we could have a great future if we can move past this issue with physical intimacy/chemistry, and that's partially why I've been so patient about the situation. One thing that does concern me is when I first broached a kind of \"defining the relationship\" talk about a week after we attempted to have sex, she kind of freaked out that we \"barely knew each other\", and since then I decided to put a pin in that conversation until there's a little bit more clarity about where we stand with each other in terms of physical chemistry and not just the companionship/emotional compatibility aspects of seeing each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "I see her in a few days and if things are still \"off\" as far as us kissing or making out or any kind of physical escalation past that, I definitely plan on bringing it up because even though I hate confrontation and kind of dread the idea that things could be off for a reason I/we can't really address, I really want to figure out what's going on and how we can get back on track because I think there's a ton of potential in our relationship and I don't want to date anyone else in the near future because I think they'd pale in comparison to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S.: To head off any comments, I don't believe she's seeing anyone else because of her previously mentioned busy work schedule, and the fact that she said she wasn't seeing anyone else when I tried to bring up defining the relationship for that exact reason. If she is, I obviously wouldn't be thrilled and would honestly be a little gutted, but because we haven't talked about exclusivity or labels there wouldn't be anything morally wrong in my eyes about it so much as just emotionally painful for me.\n",

I’ve always been emotionally self-sufficient but bad at supporting other people through their emotions— especially when it comes to grief. Growing up, funerals were messy.

      "I (33F) have a friend, let’s call her Lisa (33F). I’ve known her since I was 15 years old, now in our 30s. Lisa is a specimen. She is sweet and always there to help, but there’s a lot to deal with. She’s pretty insecure and not super confident so she overcompensates with very annoying stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she lies. She lies about dumb stuff to make herself interesting. It can be from « having royal blood » to telling something that happened in the past that I know is not true, either because I was there or because people who where there told me what really happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, she is a « know-it-all ». She will argue about the most unimportant things, alllll the time. She’s confidently incorrect a bunch, and she doesn’t let it go. It’s especially frustrating when it’s about a subject you know more about and she won’t admit she’s wrong. She’s like that with everyone, even people she just met. I have introduced a LOT of people to her over the years, and I cannot count how many times my friends, acquaintances, family etc said they didn’t have a good impression of her because of that. \n",

      "\n",
      "On top of that, when I was younger, I had my « wild days ». Going out, dating, drinking, having fun. She was always kind on the sides, following us, a little shy. When our friends and I started to settle down, to go on with our lives, partners, careers, she kind of started a « rebellious » phase where she drinks a lot and does blow with her aunt. She keeps bragging about that, which I honestly think is kind of lame? I don’t mind her being a party girl, it’s really the bragging part that annoys me. It doesn’t impress me or whatever so I don’t know why she keeps bringing that up. \n",

      "\n",
      "Last part - she borrowed money from me last year and never gave it back, never mentioned it again. 150$ while I was on mat leave so not nothing. She also borrowed a pair of white shoes and gave them back messed up, never offered to compensate me in any way. It it was me, I would have offered to pay for them, or take her out to dinner in exchange. Little things like that, that adds up to the list of annoyances. \n",

The thing is, we have a bunch of mutual friends and next week, we’re invited to the same event. Knowing her, she will see that I’m pregnant (I haven’t tell her, oops), and I know that when she’ll be a little drunk, she will try to confront me or talk to me about how her feelings are hurt and blablabla. \n",

      "Where maybe I messed up is: I haven’t seen her since last summer, always finding an excuse hoping she would get the message and then I was truly busy with work, school, baby, life, so I never addressed the situation really. Now, I don’t know how to navigate that. I don’t want to hurt her, and I feel like saying « we’re just not at the same place anymore » is kind of cliché? \n",

      "So here’s the deal, I attended a friend’s baby shower (we’ll call her Sarah) and my other friend (we’ll call her Julia) seems to be mad at me about it. We’re all in our 30s. I was invited to the shower and Julia wasn’t, but she said she didn’t care that she wasn’t invited because she didn’t want to go anyways. I was there for Sarah when she went through a tough time a few years ago and we’ve stayed in touch so I assume that’s why I got an invite. I had a really nice time seeing people I hadn’t seen in a while. People that are mutual friends/acquaintances with Julia. I’ve been dealing with health issues for over a year and it’s honestly been horrible, so anytime I can get out to socialize and enjoy myself it’s a good thing for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Julia texted me bringing up someone at the shower and negatively commenting on their appearance (I assume she saw a photo someone posted). I told Julia that it was nice to see everyone at the shower, and that a couple of our mutual friends/acquaintances had said how much they miss Julia. That’s all I said and rather than being gracious and glad that I had a nice time she responded by saying repeatedly that all those people are fake. I changed the subject and really didn’t think much of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Until the next day when she sent me a text apologizing for being rude and saying she was just mad because all those people are fake and she’s known Sarah longer but wasn’t invited, but made sure to emphasize she does not care that she was invited. And came up with a bunch of other excuses for being mad (she was tired etc.) I was confused because I didn’t realize there was an issue or that this was a huge deal and I texted back saying oh I didn’t think you were being rude at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been thinking about it though and the whole thing just really rubbed me the wrong way. I had a nice time at a baby shower and somehow it became all about her and her feelings. When it’s quite literally an event that had absolutely nothing to do with her and was about celebrating Sarah. I think she’s actually just angry she wasn’t invited but doesn’t want to admit it. And somehow I’m guilty by association for attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more context Julia seems to have an issue anytime I hang out with other friends, to the point where I do not mention it when I have plans with other friends and almost never post on social media about it. Anytime I have plans with other friends it somehow becomes about how I hurt her feelings. Meanwhile she posts everything and anytime she’s with another friend she makes sure to post a selfie with them. Which is fine because I’m an adult and know that people are allowed to have other friends besides just me! But despite all this posting she then will complain to me that she has no friends. I think it’s because she’s insecure and wants to make sure everyone knows how many friends she has. That’s just not really my thing, I prefer to spend time with friends when I’m with them rather than worrying about posting pictures. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just don’t know why she has an issue anytime I hang out with other friends, when she has other friends as well. It also feels weird that I have to hide my plans with other friends because I don’t want her to get mad at me. It just really left a bad taste in my mouth that she somehow made me attending a baby shower about her and her feelings. I don’t even know why she would need to make me aware of those feelings, I’m not the one who didn’t invite her! \n",
      "\n",
      "I think she’s obviously just mad she wasn’t invited but I was. I think it’s kind of immature and petty, and I feel like her going on about the people being fake is just something she could have kept to herself instead of going on about it when all I said was I had a nice time. And now I’m mad but don’t want to just fire off an angry text without thinking. What do I say in the text to get my point across and stand up for myself without completely ruining the friendship?\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "\n",
      "Im feeling exhausted and a bit lost in my 4 year relationship with my girlfriend, and would appreciate advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some context: \n",
      "For the first three years of our relationship, she struggled with a severe eating disorder that nearly killed her. She was physically healthy in the first year but quickly declined and ended up in hospital for some months. In addition she suffers with a general anxiety disorder. This put our relationship under consideral pressure, with me considering leaving multiple times, but feeling too guilty or scared to actually leave. However, we stayed together and I helped her through her recovery. We now live together and do most normal things in a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have been steady for a little over a year, im starting to find things difficult again. It feels like she is very dependent on me, she wont push herself, or do any hobbies or try to make friends without strong encouragement from me. She doesnt have any friends at the moment, which makes me feel like im her sole supporter. Because she doesnt have interests or friends of her own, it feels like she is very strongly reliant on me to occupy her free time. She wants to do everything with me and when I tell her I need some free time she will find reasons to interrupt it. When I am spending time with her, im constantly having to reassure her anxieties, and to keep telling her I love her. She clings to me and this can make me feel claustrophobic.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dont really share any interests but we get on despite that. All she wants to do is talk about things she is anxious about or to talk about food, as the eating disorder is still pretty strong. She has gotten better with this with time, but I dont have much energy to talk as much anymore, we dont have deep conversations much at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the above points, im feeling smothered keep losing my patience with her, im short with her and it feels like I am distancing myself from her. I find that I cant deal with her constant anxiety and questions. I just feel exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have explained this to her before, and she tries really hard to make an effort to try and give me space but I never feel it is enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have started counselling due to loss in my immediate family, and she gets anxious when I ask for privacy when I speak to my therapist. She thinks that I am talking about her and it makes her anxiety worse.\n",

      "She is a lovely person and so thoughtful and kind, she tries so hard to make me happy and I love her for it. I really dont want to hurt her, but I dont feel like I have much else to give. \n",

      "My friends and family have shown concern and I pushed it down because I believed I was fine. I think that they are good with it now. \n",

      "Body text: My (27f) boyfriend (33m) of 6 years has within the last year developed very serious depression and more recently has started very heavy drinking habits. This culminated a few months ago with an involuntary stay in a psychiatric facility after a frightening withdrawal episode. After that, we moved states to a less stressful job for him and I thought everything would be okay from then on. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the depression and drinking has started up with a vengeance and he is drinking more than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "He will not move except to pace around nervously and go to buy more alcohol. He refuses to come into the living room or leave the house unless he is going to the liquor store. And believe me, he has plenty of reasons to be depressed- he never fully grieved the loss of his brother a few years ago and has undiagnosed PTSD from a deployment. He also has sustained multiple head injuries, which he doesn't care to go to the doctor for. The issue is that he absolutely refuses to seek out any treatment; rehab, counseling, therapy, psychiatry, nothing. Even my suggestions of having me drive him to appointments is like me talking to a brick wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship that he has been neglecting and I've been desperately trying to shield her from the reality, but the few times he manages to come to the dinner table he is visibly drunk and will start being a dickhead to both of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reading I've done on this subject suggests that unless the affected person is willing to take their treatment into their own hands, the relationship is almost certainly doomed. He doesn't even seem to fully understand that I won't put up with this for much longer. Every thing I say to him goes in one ear out the other. And then when I try to leave the room to work or to grieve quietly by myself, he follows me because he refuses to be alone while also not wanting help. He blames me for his drinking and depression (I have had issues myself, but I was always functional and was never that severe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Is my instinct right that this relationship is doomed? This is my worst nightmare come true, I have been with him for so long and he used to be so wonderful. But now I can't see a future in this relationship if he legitimately has no interest in bettering myself.\n",

      "Body text: A bit of context. I met my girlfriend while we were both backpackers in Australia about 5 years ago. I'm from Canada, she and her sister are from taiwan. We lived together in Australia for 4 years with the sister living with us off and on. A little over a year ago, our Australian visas were going to expire so we decided to move back to my hometown and her sister joined us. They were on the same sort of youth backpacker visa we both had in Australia, but they're only valid for one year. My gf got approved for a permanent visa, while her sister got a sketchy, slightly fraudulent visa that expires in 3 years. With this sketchy visa, she needs to work at the same grocery store in my hometown for the entire 3 years. \n",

She told me her parents didn't want to get her formally diagnosed, but teachers suspected it growing up. She also got spoiled a lot and her maturity got stunted. In the entire 5 year relationship, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with her sister despite efforts on my part. She only started saying hello to me when I complained to my gf. She's very entitled, not thanking me for cooking, or including her as the constant 3rd wheel in any activities I have with my gf. She doesnt even appreciate my GF subsidizing her. The only relationship she's ever had was with a married guy in Australia and continued it even after the guy's family arrived in Australia.\n",

My GF's sister says she will figure something out if we leave, but we both know for damn sure she can't afford a place to live on her own. She's holding on to hope she can get a permanent visa, but with her education and changes in the immigration system she doesn't have a hope. I just feel stuck. My GF is frustrated but won't leave her sister, and her sister won't make up her mind.

      "he has jealousy issues around other men in my life. before we met, i had a neighbor (40m) a few doors down that i would sleep with on occassion over a span of maybe 6 months. we never hung out, we didn't talk much, it was purely physical. i am not attracted to this man, and i honestly think he's kind of a joke of a person. we were both basically using each other for a night of brief sex (he rarely even ever spent the night).\n",

(this is not due to any truth or credence to my sexual history or character, he just believes that about any female, as i don't have the sordid sexual past that he assumes/believes i've had, no matter how many times i tell him). i know this is part of his emotional baggage, and we both admit it is something he is working on fixing for him/us.\n",

      "Body text: Some background:  \n",
      "My (31M) girlfriend (25F) and I have been together for about a year and a half. It's been one of the easiest relationships of my life — basically no stress, we get on really well, have the same interests, and she really makes an effort to find ways to connect with me. She even went as far as asking me to help her build a PC and desk so we could be together while I'm gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll highlight that I think I was reaching anyway — she’s kind, generous, good-looking, and really thoughtful. I thought we got on great and assumed we had the same plans in life: a couple of dogs, a house, marriage, and we were both very excited about our future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family doesn’t like me. They are polite and always very friendly to me, but I have heard that they kind of badmouth me behind my back, saying I’m not good enough for their daughter, etc. Her family is important to her, so I never made a big deal about it. When she gets upset about it, I tell her, \"No one likes everyone, and they are entitled to their opinion. At the end of the day, they’re simply looking out for their daughter, but what she does in life is up to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We were recently looking into getting a house together. Unfortunately, the sale of one she was set on fell through, and it left her very upset. I consoled her and did what I could to calm her, but it understandably left her stressed. She currently lives with me in my rented house about an hour from her family, and I know she wants to live closer (the place we looked at was much closer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, along with a slight change at work making her job harder, she’s been having panic attacks and, in her words, \"doubts\" and some anxiety.  \n",
      "I've always comforted her and told her I’m not mad if she wants to cry or vent to me about what's stressing her out in life, but she’s always been adamant that no matter her thoughts, her \"one constant is that she loves me and wants to be with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, today at work she had an anxiety attack and was again talking about doubts. I told her to take some time, maybe call her parents and talk with them — that talking would help — and that I’m always here if she wants to talk to me.  \n",
      "She did just that and came home today to say she wants to break up. She said she was unable to give a good reason — she loves me, she can’t stand the thought of losing me — but feels the doubts won't go away, and she’d hate to buy a house, have dogs or kids, and still have these lingering doubts.\n",

Recently, after a house purchase fell through and her job became more stressful, she's been experiencing anxiety and doubts.

      "Body text: Hello, I’m posting this on here to get some advice because I’m lost on what I should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been dating my gf for 5 months now and we’ve had a great relationship. We have had no issues apart from a reoccurring problem which is her behaviour while drunk. Whenever she would go out with her friends she would get too drunk and I’d have to carry her home. We don’t live together but when she drinks she insists she comes back to mine which I don’t mind because I can easily take care of her and don’t have to worry about if her friends can look after her and get her home safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "However the problem starts with her behaviour whilst drunk. Firstly, she can’t stand so I literally have to drag her to the bus and some times uber us home because I can’t make it to the nearest bus stop. Secondly, she becomes a bit physical when she’s drunk. For example she would hit me while I’m trying to drag her or hit me if I get annoyed at her behaviour. Although when she’s sober she would never do anything like that. Also she gets also a bit verbally abusive, calling me names and insults when I do things like tell her she can’t go back to the club or that she should limit her drinking. Lastly she constantly asks me if I’m cheating on her and says that “I’m probably messaging other girls”. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve always found it weird that she does this as I’d never cheat on her or given her a reason to suspect that I’m cheating. She never remembers what happened the next day and apologises for her behaviour when I mention it. I didn’t rly have an issue with it as I’ve looked online and it does seem like girls do get a bit emotional when they drink. The next day she tells me that she’ll do better next time but the same thing just happens again. \n",
      "\n",
      "However after what happened a few days ago I’m not sure what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was at a party and decided to come back to mine (drunk) afterwards. While together I got her some water to sober up and I got into bed to fall asleep because the time was around 2am but she insisted that we should have sex. When I said no because she was drunk, she tried to force herself on me but I was able to push her away. When I did this she hit me. After that I got angry at her and called her unbearable and a pain to deal with when drunk and she got upset that I said that and went to bed. The next day I spoke about what happened and she was very apologetic and she didn’t remember what happened. I suggested that we should take a break for a couple days just for her to reflect on what happened hoping that it would lead to a change in her behaviour. \n",
      "\n",
      "However the same day she went out drinking again with her friends. She had messaged me at the club and I pointed out how I don’t think her drinking again the very next day was a good idea and she just stated that “I don’t want her to have fun”. I just said that maybe we should take a longer break and haven’t spoke to her since \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure what to do as I love her so much and she’s completely different when she’s sober but i don’t know if I can handle her behaviour when she’s like that anymore and it doesn’t seem like she’s going to change. Any advice on what I should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; Gf acts very bad while drunk and doesn’t change her behaviour even though she said she will. \n",

Our honeymoon phase ended about 6 months ago and we've been learning how to speak through differences that we have. It's been really challenging and my biggest concerns have been the topics of cats, dancing, and children. \n",

When he first used to come over, my cat would be doing his thing: cuddling in bed at night and such. That made my boyfriend break out on a rash that was so itchy that he scratched until he bled. Now my cat isn't allowed on the bed, or even in the bedroom when he comes over. \n",

My boyfriend says that he feels angry and jealous at the idea of me dancing with anybody else other than him. But we've not danced with each other and he would only want to take private lessons (which I cannot afford right now). Since he can afford lessons, he did propose that we do 2 private lessons a month. However, this has not come to fruition for two reasons: both of our cars have needed major repairs, and I also think that dancing is an extremely low priority for him. It's been 3 months since the lessons were brought up the first time. I am now forcing myself to go out dancing alone this month regardless of how he feels because I felt depressed not dancing. My boyfriend has said that he will not impose his feelings of anger and jealously on me and I must do what is right for me, but he will not work on those feelings.

      "His stance on having children has changed. I am passionate about having a child in my future. I want to be a parent. When we started dating, he wanted children too. Now he says he will take responsibility for a child of he has too, but he is unsure because the right things need to be in place: financial stability; a stable home; and emotional stability. He's elaborated that he worries that I'm not emotionally stable (I have been actively working through my own childhood trauma and seen results). I believe working through trauma is a lifelong process, but that I'll make the strides necessary to heal before I have a child. However, this change in his stance has me concerned. \n",

      "I realize that everybody's boundaries regarding what they tolerate in their life versus where they draw the line and move on from a relationship is different. How can I address this? I keep wondering if I should break up with him. But we both are putting in a kind and concerted effort into the relationship and we have huge respect for each other, so I'm caught between wanting to have my cat near me, and having to imagine a life without him ever being in my bed again. Always having to tread gently around my passion for dancing around him. And wondering if he's going to embrace fatherhood, or just accept responsibility for it and not jump into it with me. Is it worthwhile to pursue a relationship with this man, who is worthwhile, at the risk of parts of myself not being able to express themselves fully and comfortably? \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I've been dating my boyfriend for a year, and while we respect and care deeply for each other, key differences are creating tension. He's highly allergic to my cat, which now isn't allowed in my bedroom. He feels angry and jealous about me dancing with others but isn't prioritizing dancing with me, which has affected my mental health. Most significantly, his views on having children have shifted from wanting them to being unsure and questioning my emotional readiness due to my trauma work. I'm feeling anxious and torn between honoring my passions and future goals or staying in a relationship where I'm unsure if my core desires will be met.\n",

      "Body text: I’m 25F and I’ve been engaged to my 25M fiancé for the past 6 months. We were in a relationship in our early 20s, broke up, and then got reconnected through our families a few years later. We decided to give it another chance and eventually got engaged. While there’s been an emotional connection, there’s also been a recurring imbalance in how we show up for each other.\n",

      "Over the past year, I’ve been managing fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and recently got diagnosed with depression.

That said, the emotional distance and avoidance were present even before his job loss.\n",

      "When I shared my depression diagnosis and said I’d appreciate him checking in around my doctor appointments, he said I was “acting like a kid.” I stepped back briefly to process things, and in that time, his parents called me to say they wanted to end the engagement. He didn’t contact me directly—not even to check on my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I later called him out on how emotionally unavailable he’d been, he lashed out, called me “stupid,” said I made everything about myself, and that I was emotionally too much. He also said he wanted a “soft and peaceful” partner and that I made him feel unsettled.\n",

It’s not that we don’t see each other often and that he’s jealous that I’m spending time with my friends instead of him but he says he can’t help but feel bad because he doesn’t have that connection with others.

He saved 1000s of bikini pictures or even normal pictures of hot girls. And what shocked me the most was the comments he made on those girls posts especially one influencer where he would commennt about marrying her, dating her, dreaming of banging her, loving her!!! There were so many comments like \"she always leaves me horny\" \"fine ass\" \"would you go on date with me\" \"comeeeonnmn letss get married\" \"bow to me\" \"damnn I need her\" \"I can't stop 🥵\" \"kya thighs hai yaar\" \"kya maal hai\" hot, pretty, beautiful, cutie, sexy and  what not!! And all this while being in a serious long term committed relationship with me! Even I never received so many compliments from him as much as I found on this account! He also used to never say love you to because he thought it was a special thing to say on special occasions only but here I found him commenting I love you on random girls pictures! \n",

He would make small gestures to keep me happy. Give me time and attention. He also said he wanted to marry me and that I am his bride. But recently very suddenly he brokeup with me saying he wants to explore, have casual relationships with women, hookup and post that phase we can maybe get back together to get married, or not - God's wish. Also, he was virgin before dating me but I was not. I was in a long term relationship before (3 years old) where I lost my virginity. But he always knew this since day 1 and still he begged me to date him. \n",

      "Body text: So we're dating for 1.5 months and every time we're away she's being negative constantly and i want to cheer her up but not only does it not affect at all she says that nobody will understand her and that she's better off alone and that people and everything is temporary. We've made quite an argument about this and when i say anything critical about her she returns it with how it made her feel instead of actually listening and trying to be emphatic about me. She's super self-centered and I'm literally yearning for her to understand me but when i mention this she says sorry for being toxic, negative, bad and stuff but doesn't wanna understand that venting isn't this this is just puking poison into the other person. I want to be there for her i can be her rock bottom when shit is rough but like she just doesn't wanna change her attitude about this and I don't know how to deal with it. I'm listening to her 7/24 and be there for her but the shit she's putting me through with her negativity is just really something else I'm not responsible for her own negativity but still cause I'm caring about her her negative outlet towards life affects me immensely as well. What should i do i already said to her to go see a therapist she said she already seeing one but can't go there cause of time/money problems. The therapist lives outside of the city and she insisted that she trusts only this therapist and no one else is also troubling.

      "Body text: I (26F) and my boyfriend(27M) have been together for the past two years. We’ve known each other since we were kids and even dated briefly in high school, but it didn’t work out back then. A few years ago, we reconnected and started dating again, and since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before him, I did go on dates but most of the guys I met were either disrespectful, only interested in sex, or emotionally unavailable. My boyfriend is genuinely the sweetest, most affectionate, and loyal person I’ve ever met. He’s supported me through tough times like when I was jobless or sick and I’m deeply grateful for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s a side to him that’s becoming harder and harder to handle. He has always been a bit jealous and possessive and I knew that when we got back together. But in the past few months, it’s gotten worse. He tries to control almost every aspect of my life from my social media activity to my job choices. He gets upset over small things and often becomes emotional or cries over trivial issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to forget, whenever he gets mad, he screams at me very loudly. This is extremely triggering for me because I grew up in an abusive household where my mom used to yell at me the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that maybe he’s afraid of losing me, but his behavior is becoming very frustrating. I'm not allowed to have male friends or even speak casually with male colleagues. He doesn’t talk to girls or follow any women on social media, so he expects me to be the same. But I’m a naturally social person, and meeting his demands is exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few days ago, we had a big fight because a male colleague added me on social media and I accepted the request. This turned into a huge argument and as always, he started crying and said he’ll never change, and that if I can’t deal with it, I should leave. In a fit of anger, I told him I wanted to end the relationship. We haven’t spoken since, but I know either he’ll come back or I’ll go to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, I love him so much. I can’t imagine my life without him. We’re currently in a long distance relationship and had even planned to get married in six months. The thought of leaving him or being with someone else breaks my heart. He’s the first and only person I’ve ever been intimate with. I don’t want to lose him but I also can’t keep living like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him all the time. When I get job offers that require me to move, he straight up tells me not to take them and gets mad. His need to control everything is suffocating me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And honestly, one of my biggest fears is that if I leave, I’ll never find someone who loves me this deeply again. He truly is devoted and loyal to me, and that makes it even harder to let go.\n",

Lately I’ve been so selfish and focused on fixing myself and changing things that don’t need changed. We openly discussed this. I’m aware of the problem I’ve caused and I want to fix it. During this period of selfishness I’ve stopped showing my love to her. I stopped kissing, never say I love you until it’s said to me first, never come up with date ideas, I just wasn’t there. But I love this woman so much, she has saved my life and loves me unconditionally. I can never see that look of sadness again when I said that I haven’t been loving her. She said she won’t leave though, because she has to enough love for the both of us. So fuck me and my endeavors, I need to live for this woman again. I need to uncover my love that I buried underneath everything. I know it’s still there, how do I dig it out? How do I re-wire my brain?

      "Title: I 22M found out that my gf 22F was still in contact with a weird online situationship\n",
      "Body text: So, I come from a family of cheaters unfortunately, never got instilled in me that perception of true love when growing up, especially when I found out my dad and mom were constantly cheating to each other - and found out that when I was 11. I'd say that left on me an intangible scar that would follow me to adulthood. So I'm 22 now, and I'm on an ongoing relationship with this girl, which I adore and treasure a lot. I sacrificed so much for her, and celebrated her birthday when I came back (I had to leave temporarily) - and this is mostly a me thing, but I don't have many girl friends that I speak, literally zero, my group of friends is mostly guys. And my girlfriend in that aspect is more open, she has a handful of guy friends, and I never impose to her some restrictions or limits to who she can talk to. Sure there was one time I saw a message that put me on edge back then, because I had no idea of the context nor what kind of friendship they hold - and that was none of my business during that time. She saw my reaction and tried to ease the situation which I deeply appreciate it, so all good back then. But still in me, i had unresolved feelings, so we met and had a chat just to explain my background and where I was coming from, I just wanted transparency on this, and apparently; a guy who she was talking to was an online situationship she had (before me) that lasted a month because the guy blocked her or ghost her, I don't remember the details anymore. And she was really sad and had panic attacks about it until I came, I don't know, made me feel like a rebound or placeholder for her emotions. I appreciate her showing the chat they were having but I don't know there was a message I didn’t like, and it was from her. The guy reconnected with her, and she scolded him because of how he treated her and then she had her closure with him, she asked if he still had feelings for her and he said no. Then the guy asked her if I should know about them which she replied no. When I saw that I was shaking, I don't know. Part of me saw it like a betrayal, because I sacrificed so much to get back, sacrificed time with my family, friends, money and my own time. I was completely devoted to her for 8 months. Part of me was trying to calm down, but the other part of me the paranoic of being cheated was edging more in my mind, seeing all this very very bad. And I know it's funny because they never met physically but still, emotionally speaking I don't know what is going on her mind. Speaking of that, there was this game she played with me called Xp maker, where you can create your own character, and now that I remember she created just 1 character for me and 2 for that guy. She did proceeded to block him, but only because I found out and was not having it all. She knows me all, she knows who I follow on ig and it's mostly sport pages, and that I only chat with guys. I don't know perhaps I'm over thinking because of my problematic family but I was not having it at all\n",

      "Body text: I (22M) recently (4 months) got into a relationship with a girl (23F) and I ran into some issues, in which I don't know if I'm the one who is at fault or if the relationship is toxic. I find my girlfriend a bit controlling and that's bothering me bit, she made me break off a friendship with a friend that I gamed with, because she thinks he hits on me, he is gay but I disagree with her about him hitting on me, regardless I trusted her judgement so no questions asked, I had to cut my hair a certain way to not look \"flamboyant\", I also disagree but did so anyway, I had to go to the gym less because I didn't give her enough attention while I was working out, I also disagree but conceded, maybe she's right, I do zone out when I work out. I have to play videogames less because I now have to work more to provide for her needs, she didn't like our old house and we had to move to higher rent, but I said all right because the house was indeed too small, she also said we needed to change our car, I didn't think necessary but my car was quite old, she was right about that. The last part is she talked to her ex on instagram and said I didn't trust her when I complained about it saying I had to break off my friendships but she keeps her ex around.

      "I (28M) am experiencing relationship issues with my partner (28F). We have been together for three years. I’m looking for advice and/or an objective opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were colleagues for several years first (minimal interaction - different departments). As mentioned above, we’ve now been in a relationship for three years - first year living separately and second & third year living together. We are not married or engaged. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning we had issues with her texting/interacting with several male colleagues who were clearly hitting on her. This stuff happens, no big deal. I was more upset with her reaction to it - i.e. not putting a stop to it. No cheating (that I’m aware of). This upset me because I’m fiercely loyal and refuse to maintain any inappropriate relationships with females that may upset my partner. My trust in her was impacted, but I’ve since forgiven her and we worked/moved past it. There have been no further instances of this that I’m aware of. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, our main issue has been this - I contribute heavily to the relationship and our future, yet feel as if her efforts and contributions are subpar. Let me be clear, she’s very pleasant to be around. Super chill, low maintenance, rarely gets upset or angry, and texts me frequently, etc. This is all great, and I appreciate these qualities; however, I feel as if relationships require work. To provide context:\n",
      "\n",
      "- I’d say I perform 70% of the household chores, to her 30%. \n",

      "- I have now booked and planned two seperate overseas holidays, with absolutely no assistance from her whatsoever. All she was required to do was transfer me half her share ($). \n",
      "\n",
      "- I have worked my ass off to purchase two investment properties in the last two years. This was done to secure/provide a better future for us. In terms of funding, I’d say I’ve contributed 60% to her 40%. That doesn’t matter to me though, the properties are both of ours and split equally. As I’m sure you’re aware, a lot of time, effort, and planning goes into a property purchase and ongoing management, etc. I have done this by myself with absolutely no assistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "- I’d say that I plan 90% of our dates/time together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both work full-time and often have conflicting work schedules, so we have very little time off together - usually only in the evenings for a couple of hours. It’s quite rare for us to have a full day off together. I noticed that during the small amount of time we did spend together, it would be spent on the lounge on our phones watching TV ‘together’. I was just as guilty of this and I initiated a chat about removing/being off our phones whilst spending time together. Whilst I maintained my end of the bargain, her phone usage began to creep back in - we had an argument about this and she later apologised, etc. and we moved on. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for our sex-life, it’s verging on being non-existent at this point. At the moment, we’d sleep together maybe once every three-four weeks. Whilst I understand some married couples go months - we’re still in our twenties, not married, and don’t have kids. I initiated a very polite and respectful sit-down chat about this. To simplify, I explained my needs and wants and she explained hers, which were practically nothing. We agreed once or twice a week was reasonable. However, it’s still every three-four weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months back we had a big argument, about her lack of effort (that’s usually the only thing we argue about). She had also been in a mood for several weeks by that point. Over the coming days it came out that she had been experiencing doubts about our relationship, wasn’t sure if she wanted to be with me anymore, and generally felt lost and confused about everything - work, friendships, relationships etc. After much probing from my end, she explained that there were parts of my personality that she no longer found attractive. She felt that my line of work had made me somewhat cold, unapproachable, cranky at times, and most importantly - lacking/rejecting affection. I acknowledged this and took responsibility for it. Without boring you with all the details, I put a huge amount of effort into myself and resolved all of these issues. To be fair, I can’t blame work for all of these issues, a lot of them were probably due to pent up resentment I had towards my partner because of her past behaviour and lack of effort. We had a respectful chat about this and moved forward. However, whilst I’m now on my best behaviour, deep down I’m becoming more frustrated. The reason being, not only am I working just as hard/contributing to the relationship as I was before, I’ve also addressed all of her concerns and worked on myself, yet her effort has not improved. \n",
      "\n",
      "During and shortly after our chat - the one in which she voiced that she was having doubts - she explained that she had been feeling depressed. I empathised with her and explained that all she does is work and study. I’m quite an introvert and enjoy time to myself, only catching up with mates once or twice a week (because I’m lucky enough to work with people I love everyday at work). My concerns were that she had adapted to my introverted lifestyle, which isn’t suited to her, so no wonder she was a little depressed and isolated. For years I had been encouraging her to play sport and catch-up with her friends/family more, etc. During out chat, I told her that I would pay for her to see a psychologist, which she has - two or three times so far. I also told her to see her friends and family more, which she has - she’s already been on a couple of weekends away with her girlfriends and organised a couple of holidays with them coming up. I gave her spending money for this so she can enjoy her time away. I also practically forced her into returning to netball, paid for registration, and bought her netball shoes. Would you believe it - she now loves playing netball again. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is great; however, I still feel as if she isn’t contributing to our relationship enough. We have had so many chats where I have clearly and politely explained my needs and wants. She previously mentioned that she lacked effort in the past because she was having doubts, but is now 100% committed. This is how every argument ends - she apologises, takes responsibility, say’s what she will do to improve, and says she’s committed. But, over the coming weeks I experience no change in behaviour or effort. I’m still doing most of the housework, book all the holidays, manage our properties, organise dates/time together, etc. Another ongoing issue, which we’ve spoken about, is how I feel incredibly unappreciated and unrecognised. There has never been any appreciation, genuine thanks, or recognition from her for all the effort I have put in, and continue to put into, our relationship and future, including holidays, housing, finances, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had another chat about our sex-life, during which time she once again explained that it’s not me, that she simply doesn’t have a sex drive or any sexual fantasies. For context, it’s still only every three-four weeks. Sometimes she’ll initiate, but it feels forced to me. We had a discussion about her coming off the pill and she’s going to the GP to discuss other contraceptive options - I offered, but she doesn’t want me to come. She’s still open to discussing it with me though. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we first got together, our sex-life was much better. It was once or twice a week and she’d frequently send me photos/texts, but now it’s nothing. I always had a slightly higher sex-drive, nothing crazy, but hers has seemed to have vanished. We’re both in great shape and really take care of our health and appearance. \n",

      "To be honest, it feels as if I’m in a parent-child relationship, or a relationship of a couple that have been married for twenty years. I’m tired of having to take the lead in everything. I’ve suggested seeing a couples-therapist, and she’s open to it, but it won’t get done unless I do it. She tells me that I over analyse everything and need to chill. It can be hard to get a grasp on what’s reasonable and what isn’t - I haven’t spoken with anyone about this and embarrassingly have only used the super agreeable ChatGPT. Apologies for the lengthy post, I tried to keep it as short as possible, believe it or not. \n",

      "\n",
      "We moved in together 3 months ago, after doing long distance throughout college. About 2 years ago, he started dealing with extreme anxiety. I encouraged him to see a therapist (I also deal with awful anxiety and therapy has helped me tremendously) and I expressed to him how much it can help. One of the first instances of an anxiety attack occurred when I was with him. He fell to the floor and was screaming, he scared me and I didn’t know what to do and broke down crying. I’ve never seen him like that and didn’t know how to help. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he is feeling anxious, he says he feels like he needs to “get out” and will go and drive aimlessly. I used to go with him because I feared his safety but he drives recklessly and speeds, even when I am screaming out and begging for him to stop and pull over. The last time this happened he grabbed my finger so tightly that it bruised. I told him he was making me feel very unsafe and that I was scared of him in that moment. He was very apologetic and does not let me ride with him on his drives now (and I don’t let myself go either). \n",
      "\n",
      "He would struggle with anxiety every once in a while (like a bad day once or twice every other week) but recently it’s been very consistent and he is constantly struggling. I told him I need him to go get help and I cannot see him struggle like this so often. He agrees but then doesn’t reach out to anyone, even after I told him i’d help him find a therapist and help with all of the paperwork if needed, drive him to the appointment, etc. He doesn’t act on it and then will have a period of time where he feels stable and then will say “I think I’m fine”. But then it’s just a matter of time until he has an anxiety spell again and the cycle repeats. I get frustrated with him. I can only deal with so much when he is not reaching out for help and seems to just wallow in his feelings. \n",

      "Body text: Okay so the backstory here is that we are both college students who work at the same summer camp. We started dating early last summer (9+ months ago) and everything was great. During the school year we go to colleges in different parts of the country which means long distance for those times. Despite this, the first semester was great! We had very good communication (calling 4-5 times a week, sometimes for 10 mins, sometimes 3 hours), but nothing suffocating and both support each other's ventures. We have also flown to see each other throughout school to shorten the time apart in addition to winter and spring break when we were at home and close distance. \n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, starting second semester and ramping up to now, she has begun to communicate less and less when we are apart. I will usually tell her times in the day I am free and suggest calling 3-4 times per week, and she routinely responds that she has a lot going on, or answers calls but seems disinterested. She claims that she is independent which is something that I know and love about her, but it has gotten to the point where she only wants to call maybe once or twice a week and the disinterested demeanor on these calls often leaves me feeling down. Despite this, she texts me and sends reels normally and our time together in person is relatively normal (except when she feels bad about the problems discussed in the rest of the text), and she both shows and insists that she loves me very dearly and has no interest in breaking up. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our conversations she has expressed having more mental health struggles recently, and to her credit, has begun therapy for this reason. The other day she told me about a conversation with her therapist about me, where she and her therapist agreed that she has a tendency to push away even if partners are not acting codependent. She expressed that she knows this is true and is regretful that I have to experience the effects. She also said that this is something she wants to work on because she wants our relationship to work for both of us. We talked about this and agreed that we should try a setup where she initiates calls so that we can talk when she is feeling up to it, since I am almost always engaged regardless of when we call. \n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this was a good solution, but since the day that we agreed on this (8 days ago), she has only initiated one call which lasted 7 minutes. \n",

      "I don't want to break up either, and starting in a few weeks we will be short distance for the whole summer so maybe things will change, but over these past 8 days I have been feeling very lonely. I understand her feelings are real, and unrelated to me but I need a bit more from her to make it through this until she can feel normal again.

We have never had any emotional intimacy and I cannot get myself to be physically intimate with him either. We want to separate but we can't till we have our green card process completed as well as the medical needs of our child are extensive enough that single parenting will impact that. This will settle down in near future but at the moment it's taking our complete involvement. \n",

To her, not having sex meant feeling undesirable and unwanted.\n",

We like holding hands, kissing, and hugging although at times she cringes from getting an ick? On one hand, I feel like circumstances like having a busy day, opting for a different fun activity, or just being tired at the end of the day were contributors. I consider myself decently attractive - I have dated around before this relationship. I have gone to the gym everyday for years. She told me what bothers her might be my style including hair and clothing. However, I feel that I put a lot of time into fixing my hair and received compliments growing up. Clothing-wise, I enjoy wearing gym clothing and relaxed fit. Why? Because at professional setting for work, I have to wear business casual, white coat, or whatever. She tried to change me, to consider certain barbers by sending some barber haircut videos. Men influencers who try on trendy clothes. I was told that I am attractive even in those gym and relaxed clothings by others. She argues that she doesn't see me in work clothes most times on the other hand.\n",

I guess I still found her to be perfect in her own way and thought this is just a part of growing old together. It was about being understanding that only sex is not what defines the relationship but other small things in it. Other than this sex thing, I've been fairly happy in the relationship. This is my longest relationship while it is the first serious relationship for her. Perhaps I thought she is her whole self with raw emotions and feelings with honesty as she tells me things like \"I don't find you sexually attractive.\" I still feel butterflies when I see her.

But my boyfriend says that he thinks it’s starting to affect me and I don’t agree. I’ve talked to friends and my siblings about this and they don’t think I do either. One of my siblings (29F) I’ve spoken to is sober and I tell her everything, so she would be the first person to tell me if I had a drinking problem. \n",
      "Every time we speak about this (which is often) I feel like he doesn’t listen to me when I disagree with him and it makes me feel so bad about myself. I’m already very stressed out with exams coming up and these conversations make it worse. I really struggle with academic anxiety so being able to spend time with my friends is like an escape for me. He’s admitted before that he can be too critical, but I don’t know how to get him to stop talking about it all the time. Some other things he mentions is that I skip class too much and that I’m too messy. How do I tell him that him criticizing me so much is making me feel bad?\n",

      "Title: Best friend always drops me for her partner\n",
      "Body text: A. was my best friend from 2010 to 2023. Every day, she came to my house (couldn't go to hers because of her family). We did EVERYTHING together. We told each other everything. We were like siblings. The only exception was when she was in a relationship. Then, she would disappear. She would replace me with her partner, and the only time she would reach out to me was when they had an argument or when she got dumped. This could go on for months without me hearing from her at all. I’ll admit, I only realized this pattern in recent years. I should add that I always took her back without hesitation, no questions asked. I was always happy whenever she came back into my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had always been single until 2021-2022. When she was single, and I had a relationship for the first time, she becamevery toxic and hostile. I still saw her twice a week during that period, but when I couldn’t meet a third day because I had plans with another friend OR partner, she would get angry and manipulate me. She’d make me feel guilty, as if I was neglecting her. To be fair, I think meeting twice a week is still a lot for best friends when in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she’s been in a stable relationship for two years, and it feels like she doesn’t even know me. She can’t make plans with me because \"she’s bad at planning.\" When I ask her to hang out, I hear she has something planned with her partner. She would only be available last minute when her partner is busy. And when I tried to make plans, it was always, \"It can only be between this time and this time, because before and after, I’m with my partner.\" Eventually, the schedule would be rearranged five times, all to accommodate her partner. I’ve also noticed that she doesn't share anything with me, but shares everything with him. It’s like I don’t even know her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This whole situation has hurt me. I feel discarded, replaced, like all those years of friendship we shared don't matter. I've tried to talk to her about it, but when I express how I feel, she always blames external factors—work stress, financial problems, etc. To me, that feels like an excuse. It’s obvious her priorities have shifted, She can’t seem to divide her attention between people. She either gives everything to her partner or to her best friend, and now it’s all about him. I miss her so much, but I don’t think of her as a friend anymore. I grieve the friendship we once had. It feels like she’s completely adapting to her partner and losing her own identity in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment of anger, I told her that I didn’t want to see her anymore. She responded in a sweet way, but her excuses still don’t sit right with me, and I just didn’t respond. So now, I’m left wondering: *What should I do? I honestly don't think this will ever change, and I don't want to be a \"half friend\" only when her partner is unavailable.*\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr My best friend for over a decade now only gives attention to her partner and doesn’t have time for me. I'm left wondering what to do, as I don’t want to be a “half friend” when her partner’s not available.\n",

      "Body text: I (22F) have been in an on-and-off relationship with a guy (23M) since October 2023. We’re not officially together, so I call him my “lover.” We took a two-month break and started seeing each other again in October 2024. I told him I’d need time before considering an official relationship to ensure we’re in a good place, so his not asking me to be his girlfriend hasn’t been an issue.\n",

In the past month, he’s been taking days to respond to simple messages and often ignores my questions or statements, shifting to unrelated topics. This wasn’t always the case—things were better before. We’ve discussed this multiple times, and while he seems to understand and briefly improves, he reverts to the same pattern within a week. Three weeks ago, I brought it up again and he listened and took action, but looking back, his responses feel like he’s just trying to appease me. He struggles to express his emotions and often needs prompting to share how he feels.\n",

      "\n",
      "I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for around 2 years now. Just after the 1 year mark (mid year 2024) we moved in together. It was hard to adjust to but we really wanted this so we tried really hard to make it work. It was really hard and some weeks we fought every day and nearly called it quits multiple times. I felt very sad and very lonely. At the worst of it he decided we needed to break up (end of 2024) we decided we wouldn’t end the lease and just stay until it was finished. we had different rooms and our scheduled didn’t align so we didn’t really see each other that much. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time I was obviously devastated and depressed and extremely lonely. He treated me like he didn’t know me and like I was trash when we were out in public or with friends but at home he would try to be nice and friendly with me. It really messed with my head ALOT. I was so up and down not knowing what was going on. He started going out a lot and I felt even more lonely because he didn’t invite me to anything or want me around his friends really, I also tried to make plans with him but he was always “busy”. It was heartbreaking to feel rejected like that. Eventually I started going out with my friends more and having fun and I felt so alive again. Obviously I yearned for that comfortability and safeness that he gave me but I was having fun. I started talking to someone I used to talk to again and a guy I had randomly met had started talking to me. It was all going fine until one nice he came across the messages and was really really upset. In my head I believed he shouldn’t have been upset because he broke up with me but he felt as though it was wrong and I was leading him on? We had a big fight and I messaged those two guys saying sorry I can’t do this I’m just not in the right headspace at the moment which they both understood and respected. I tried really hard to win my ex boyfriend back over so he didn’t hate me. After a while of just putting my feelings last and just prioritising stability between us he finally stopped hating me. He felt that we were better and asked me if we could give things another go which I agreed to because I felt that we were better and I felt loved and appreciated. I felt that we could make things work and I felt safe and comfortable with him. But I’ve been thinking about some of the people I talked to and how free I felt therefore questioning if we should take a break or breakup or do I just stay with him and just keep having these thoughts forever? But I’m also worried that the grass isn’t green on the other side and that I’m going to loose such a lovely person in my life who I love dearly. My family also loves him and he is so lovely to my friends and is just a great guy. Because I know if we end he probably wouldn’t want to be friends with me again. \n",

I don’t know what to do. I’m dying to go on holidays or move to another country and meet new people but I just can’t afford it. And I feel like I’m missing out on being in my 20s I feel like I need to do silly things and meet new people have flings etc. I feel like I don’t even know who I am at all and the days are just flying past me. \n",

You’re craving freedom, self-discovery, and new experiences, but you’re scared of losing someone you still love. You’re feeling stuck between comfort and growth.\n",

That led to losing my job and racking up credit card debt while I tried to stay afloat. Eventually, I worked 60-hour weeks at Amazon to pay off that debt. I did it—but now I’m completely burnt out.

      "I want us to grow together, but our priorities don’t align. At the beginning of the month, he swapped a work shift to drive an hour to a friend’s birthday party (it was BYOB, so he budgeted for that), and I just assumed he had already paid rent. I didn’t even want to ask. Then on the 9th, he tells me he doesn’t really have money for rent and might need help. I haven’t told him about my savings because I’m afraid he’ll think, “Oh, she’s got it.” I wanted to share it with him out of pride, not obligation.\n",

Our first Christmas together, I got him a PS5 and a full setup—headset, extra controller, a gaming chair, everything. He let his little brother play with the headset, and it got broken. The PS5 is all scuffed now. I gave him an expensive extended storage device I used to use, and he treats it like it’s disposable.\n",

      "Body text: I need opinions about my dilemma. Me and my girlfriend love playing games as a hobby together, but honestly it's her more. And last year she found this open world game where you can fight people which you can also have chat or voice on. I knew my girlfriend has anger issues before (it's the way she grew up with) and seeing her play that game just makes it worse (game's really filled with toxic people). So I talked to her about it, making her realize her actions and she eventually stopped playing the game. But here's the thing, she really loved that game and been dropping hints to me that she wanted to go back and play. Part of me wanted to say no but at the same time, I don't want to be controlling because I just want what's best for her, especially her mental health. So now, I told her that you can play it again, but I did express how much I hate seeing her out of the mood just because of a petty argument in a game (she once have projected that anger towards me after playing the game). She said she'll prove it to me that she has changed but I don't know. I'm just hurt because I feel like she's not considering my concern here but again at the same time I don't want to force her out from playing because it feels like I'm taking a part out from her. Can anyone help me? Thank you. \n",

I recently had ACL surgery (3 weeks ago), at the same time due to poor timing of the injury we got a flock of baby chicks that have been living in a brooding box inside until they get big enough to go outside (plan was to have them in the basement while they’re babies - i now can’t use the stairs easily). I’m able to work from home during my recovery, he works long days usually 7-6. I also have a dog that’s since become our dog i guess. we have a large yard to up keep, a garden to tend, and just general household chores of course. I need his support a lot right now. physically, mentally as i’m usually an active person who always has something planned and being home all the time has been an adjustment, and emotionally which has been an ongoing struggle for us previous to the injury as he’s a very push it under the rug type of guy and getting him to talk about emotions is like pulling teeth..\n",

I want him to contribute to the process of planning and buying groceries for dinner. It’s literally always something that gets me worked up lately and I feel like i constantly beat him down about what he’s not doing right or what he can do better. but honestly I have a lot more time than him, my job is not very demanding right now and hes told me he works so hard FOR me and our future. he does so much for the house and yard that takes significant time after work. he has a lot more responsibilities as a partner to me than any of his friends as they’re all single just hanging out doing whatever they want living with roommates. he’s never said that he’s envious i think he loves me and our life we’ve started to build but i know he’s tired. he just wants to chill like we used to, without me having some problem that i ruin the evening talking about. anyway, its gotten worse since my helplessness with an injured leg, but it was still a problem before.\n",

On Valentine’s Day, we planned a special trip and got an AirBnB, when we wanted to have some sexy time he couldn’t perform and he admitted it was because of porn. This hurt me so badly. We talked about it more in depth maybe a week or so after and had a good, healthy conversation about our feelings.

      "I don’t know if this is just more of a me issue, or if this is simply just someone I’m not meant to be with. I know our intimate relationship hasn’t been long, but he’s been my friend for many years. We’ve become so close, I don’t know what it would be like if we were only friends again.

He raises his voice sometimes and there have been instances where he clenches his fist, murmurs to himself and abuses or says stuff like 'fuck this',he sometimes points his finger at me aggressively, and last night he threw a blanket on the bed next to me angrily while we just cooling off after an argument that wasn't even that serious. \n",

He used to cheat once on his ex and he admitted that he's already changed and is currently managing to be a better person. He used to make me as his second choice, even though we're already dating at the time, as in when he asks his friend to hangout and they can't attend, he ask me instead (hence why i said I'm the second choice). Whenever we cuddle or have intimacy he rarely does aftercare and that makes me feel hurt and used. My first ever kiss were with him, and It happened because he asks me a lot of time even though i said no, he still asks over and over so i agree with him. On our 10th month of the relationship, i bring up how i felt in the first few month of dating and he said that he feels betrayed that I'm not true to my feelings. Now whenever some things that he does triggers me, i cant help but think about how i feel trampled all over in the past by him and how i feel guilty about letting myself be treated that way. I cant help that my mind keeps replaying things that he does that hurts me in the past whenever we argue, even though it's evident that he's changing into a better person.

I know that his family situation has been very draining to him, and ever since his family has had these issues we don’t spend that much time together. I know he has so much on his plate right now and he barely has the energy to do things for himself, but it has also been hard on me, and not being able to spend time with me and fulfill my emotional needs. I try to keep it to myself, but it can make me feel lonely at times. I don’t want to add more stress into his life as he is already going through so much, and I’m trying to give him grace and be patient about everything. He is a good guy and everything but I feel a bit stuck. Do you think I should bring it up (as I said I am worried because I don’t want him to have another things to worry about) or should I just let this pass? Please let me know how I should go about this. \n",

      "Body text: Tldr:  My boyfriend & I are having issues after 5 years because I want to travel more before kids, but he's all about saving money and building his career. Hes not comfortable when I suggest going alone, and thinks we're on different pages about the future. I love him, but exploring the world is my passion and I thought our recent issues might be because of his mom passing away a few months ago. How can we fix this and both have what we want while being together?\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend (26M) and I (26F) have been together for almost 5 years. I have always had a passion for traveling and traveled a lot before we met. We have been on a few really good trips together to different places around the world over the years usually one big trip a year and he seemed to love it. I recently brought up how I wanted to go on a trip and he said he wanted to stay home and save money and grow in his career and make as much money as he can to grow his income. I told him it was fine if he didn't want to go and that I would go alone. He said he didn't feel comfortable with that. It lead to a lot bigger of a conversation about our futures. He said he wants to grow his career to be able to have a family and settle down. Although I want to have a family I also don't think ill ever give up traveling its a big love of mine. I want to get a lot of traveling out of my system before we have kids but he sees it as me caring more about traveling than the future of being a parent and not wanting the same things as him. He feels that we aren't at the same page in life. I don't feel this is the case but I respect him wanting to grind early on to be able to have what he wants in life and I want to have fun and see the world before we have others depending on us and traveling becomes harder. I do feel our relationship has been drifting but I also thought that was due to his mom passing a few months ago and the grief and thought we would get back to being good soon. I want to be with him and love him but traveling and seeing the world is important to me. I don't want to break up over this.\n",

      "Title: My BF (22M) likes to gamble and it is starting issues\n",
      "Body text: So my bf (22M) and me (22F) have been dating for 1 year. We met in college but I am a senior and he is a junior since he took a gap semester. I come from a family of gamblers (my mom would always go to the casino and my dad bets on horse racing every week). Their gambling led to problems where my dad lost our house since he stopped paying rent to gamble. This led to me hating gambling and seeing it as a deal breaker in relationships. Now, I like to think I’m in a very happy relationship. My boyfriend is very caring and I really do love him and see a future with him, but he unfortunately gambles. He comes from a wealthy family unlike me. His dad taught him how to play poker and his family likes to play. We have had multiple arguments where he goes to the casino for a very long time and loses money. He has currently stopped going since he got into a car accident and now has no car to drive to the casino. However, he plays poker with some friends every week. He really prioritizes his poker sessions and it’s one of the only things he does in terms of extracurriculars. I have expressed my discontent with him going to play poker until very late (3am and later) every week, but he just brushes it off and says he doesn’t really lose or make much money, it’s just for fun.  This week, we are both going on trips so we won’t get to spend much time together. I expressed to him that I would appreciate if we could sleep together for 3 nights since we both leave tomorrow. I was really looking forward to going to his place after a meeting I had, but he ended up texting me that he really wants to go play poker. This made me upset since he had previously said that he wouldn’t go play since he already went on Sunday and he was down to spend more time together. We got into an argument and he ended up going to Poker. I am really upset and I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if I’m being too needy. I also don’t know if it’s my past trauma kicking in since I grew up in a family of gamblers. I am also concerned that we will have worse gambling issues in the future. I have excused his gambling by thinking that since he comes from an affluent family who is very good at their finances, it won’t be as big a deal in the future. Also, our relationship thrives in every other aspect. What should I do / what do you guys think? Do you guys have any advice for me?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Extra info: I am graduating this semester and he’s staying so I’m worried about what will happen to us in the future. I have a job offer and have worked very hard to make it out since I am first gen and low income. He doesn’t work as hard (he has never had a job except for being an intern at his parents’ company). I rationalize that when he gets his own job and sees the hard work it takes to earn money he will stop gambling.\n",

      "Title: Bf is/is becoming alcoholic\n",
      "Body text: I 29F am looking for advice regarding what to do about my relationship. I met my BF 35M about 5 years ago and he barely ever drank alcohol because he didn’t care for the taste, but regularly smoked pot to help him eat, sleep and for recreation. He is so generous and kind and wants to make everyone feel welcomed in all situations. I love him for this and because he treats me really well generally. However I’m afraid his view on reality and his personality is becoming warped over time, as his habitual drinking worsens. It seems like minor disagreements that could be handled maturely and by giving eachother space, agreeing to disagree and understanding each others subjective perception, turn into big blowouts that last a full day or more. It all started about a year into our relationship when his ex-gf deceived him to steal their shared dog and moved across the country. This broke him to the point where he began having panic attacks that made him to scared to leave the house. He finally established care with a psychiatrist that just prescribed him Effexor and a Benzodiazepine. He adamantly refused to go to therapy and believes it is a waste of time for him. He has a degree in psychology so claims he knows all about it and that counseling is not for him. Slowly he began drinking a beer here and there after work and now he drinks 2-4 tall cans of beer per day and before doing anything even if it’s in the morning. Overtime he has began premedicating social events with the benzodiazepine and proceeding to drink several tall beers. He gets extremely obnoxious this way and makes those around him uncomfortable. It’s gotten to the point where his friends want to stage an intervention bc of his inappropriate behavior and angry outburts w his friends/family. I don’t want to abandon him as I’m fully committed to him but I’m worried bc there’s a line in the sand for everything. I don’t know how to handle this; I really don’t want to breakup with him but don’t want to do this for my whole life. Do you think we are past the point of no return? What should I do? What would indicate that there is no use waiting for him to change.\n",

      "Title: I'm fed up trying to communicate with my bf and don't know what to do next\n",
      "Body text: My lord I have tried typing this so many times. I feel like I'm completely over reacting and being so dumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me(29) and my bf (31m) have been dating over a year. I'm really frustrated and annoyed with my emotions. I have trouble regulating them due to abuse and mental health struggles but communicating has always been very important to me. I am rather straight forward and he bottles emotions and isn't as good with communicating things. He blames it on not being good with words and not wanting to upset me but he has no problem inserting issues of his own when I'm trying too communicate with him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm messy and unorganized on the best of days. I struggle a lot to work full time, raise my son with next to no support, deal with the unbelievable amount of chaos that's always coming up. Constantly run thin but always trying again. My house does not stay spotless and me and my son do have some messy habits. I didn't have structure growing up so I'm winging it trying to give him the most I can but it's hard. This will be relevant for later because me being messy has always been something my bf hones in on and always nit picks at. It's not like gross but I don't mind the dirty cloths on the bathroom floor till I get to them and I'm a bit of a gremlin when it comes to my room. My son leaves stuff around, which is also annoying to me and I'll have him clean up his mess. He(my son) does help me clean. My bf is the opposite and is very tidy. There's other things but that's the main one. The other main thing is is absolute lack of communication. He will not say shit till I am trying to express something and then he brings up things that aren't even related to what I'm trying to say. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we were fighting last night, which I'll get into later, and as I was trying to express how I was feeling he brought up him wanting me to change because he likes to keep his house presentable (understandable but he also always says he understands I have a lot on my plate and can't do everything and clean everything perfectly and doesn't want too make me feel bad about it but then constantly nit picks it to death and acts like I'm so filthy and says he doesn't want to move in together because he doesn't want to get angry about it and lose his temper with me or my son. Like first of all, if you know I don't have time or energy to keep my house spotless and you don't want to make me feel bad about it why are you constantly nit picking it, habits can change and get better over time and my son can be taught to be better but I can only do so much with what I have right now and why the hell would me being messy be enough to send you over the edge and get so pissed?? I can keep up with the house better if I wasn't doing it all myself and had some support but I'm never gunna be as tidy as he is. Our nature is just different) \n",
      "\n",
      "My goodness that wasn't even what I was gunna say. That's just a huge thing we always bicker about. What he brought up was how he didn't feel like a family when we eat together because me and my son are usually watching TV or something on my phone. Which hes never once said anything about. I didn't grow up eating as a family and it's been just me and my son for so long we always sat to eat together watching something. I was like you could have brought this up at any time, and he said he thought I would just figure it out because we are both adults. I was like I'm not a mind reader, and again hes bringing up things that aren't even related to what I was trying to talk about. I can't know something hes not verbally telling me. That's not how it works but he does that like I'm just supposed to know and change all my little habits he hates without actually telling me anything. It always feels so nit picky. Like just tell me you want to put screens away while we eat. That's fine with me but he doesn't and then hes pissed about it and doesn't say anything till I'm forcing communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "So finally to thing that just sent me over was I was trying to tell him last night I did not feel emotionally taken care of by him. A while ago I sat him down and asked if despite fears and the rest if was willing to just work things out and do it together with me and just get some reassurance about what he wants. He basically told me he didn't know and hesitated. And my confidence has just been a bit crushed since then. So I ruminated on how I was feeling for a while because I didn't want to over react, I wanted to be sure about how I was feeling and do my best to tell him in a clear manner. We didn't really talk for a few weeks because I was defaulting to isolating with my feelings and he doesn't tend to reach out even if he needs me so we just weren't talking and I wasn't pretending like I was okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other day I was like okay can we sit down and talk. I rambled out how I was feeling. Insecure, not emotionally secure, confused about what he really wants (because he talks about getting me pregnant, having a family, and getting married some day. Stuff like that but actually moving in together is too scary and me being messy is so bad to him that it's enough to possibly make him get pissed and lose his shit), that I'm not feeling good enough because hes always nit picking at flaws. Which maybe it's not nit picking, his preferences are valid but I'm just stuck like where do we compromise, or do I just need to be a different person to meet your standards? He offered no reassurance whatsoever. I felt completely ignored. Few days go by and I decide to go visit but I text him and tell like I'm still not feeling okay. But he doesn't respond to my text offering support and when I get there hes just acting like everything's all okay because hes not mad anymore and wanting to hug and kiss on me. Now I really don't like physical anything when I'm not emotionally OK because I don't wanna be affectionate that way because it doesn't feel genuine when I'm not okay and I just don't like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I go home trying to calm down and be like okay whatever don't over react. I texted him later like hey I'm really frustrated, I don't feel like you're emotionally supporting me. He replies, what do you want me to do? Brings up wanting me to change being messy and stuff, saying stuff about how I'm defensive about my son so he can't say anything (which he can but hes rude about it so I asked him to just think about how hes going to say it) and I'm like again this is what I mean. You don't listen and bring up stuff that isn't related to what I'm trying to say. Then he brings up the thing about eating as a family. When I said again he could have brought that up at any other moment. Like why do they always come up when I'm trying to communicate something to you. That he doesn't listen. Then he says something like, usually I can take care of your emotions but I'm going through a lot right now and you're not taking care of me and that I've been making everything about myself lately. Which just felt like such a blow. His brother died a few years around this time but my nephew just died February and my step dad died January. So yes we are both going though so much around this time but it's not just him struggling. And I feel like he always turns it back to him some how. Or isn't even addressing what I'm saying. I don't need him to be the keeper of my emotions and I told him that. I feel everything very intensely and sometimes I need extra time because my temper is shorter than a match stick but I'm the one dealing with them at the end of the day and controlling them so I'm not lashing out on the people around me unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of it I was just like I don't even care if you think I'm being selfish. Because all I needed from him was to reassure and to at least listen to how I was feeling. I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to be asking for. He wants this perfectly calm and peacful life and I told him when I first talked to him I don't know if I can offer him that because of my struggles and how there's alwsys something crazy popping up and kids definitely don't equal quiet and peace all the time. And I told him again last night it's fine if I'm not exactly what hes looking for in a partner if my flaws are too much, we dont have to force a relationship. But of course he didn't reply to that either time either. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was like look I'm not mad, I'm just sad blah blah blah and I should take some time to cool down. I am always annoyed all the time but it takes a lot go get that angry because I am aware of my temper and keep such a tight hold on it. So I was like no I'm sick of feeling like I'm not good enough and you not listening so I'll be selfish and angry. Maybe being a little more petty than necessary but it's just been the same thing so many times with him being dismissive of how I feel, never bringing anything up till I'm forcing communication and acting like it's somehow my fault or making excuses, saying hes just a broken person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hes not bad to us. He treats us well and takes care of us in other ways. But this stuff is so important to me and it feels like hes always dismissing it, not taking it seriously and not willing to face uncomfortable emotions. I don't know if I'm seriously just being so dramatic and I'm sorry for how long this is. I've tried to type it like 7 times in a polite structured manner but I just couldn't. I'm so frustrated and it feels so dumb. But I don't know to navigate healthy relationships because I'm not used to them so I'm not sure what to do in this situation anymore. I've tried to communicate the same things and I just feel like drawing a line between us now. I'm tired of repeating myself a million times and being dismissed. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR my (29) bf (31) and I have been dating over a year. Every time I try to communicate how I'm feeling hes dismissive. He only bring up issues hes been feeling and thinking about when I'm forcing communication. It's getting old and I don't know what to do next.\n",

      "Body text: My friend (27F) has been in a relationship with a guy she met in October last year. From day one, he has been mentally abusive and manipulative, constantly humiliating her. He is extremely toxic and sexist. He believes women should stay at home, serve their husbands, and not work. He tells her she needs to ask for his permission to go out with her friends or even to have a beer. If she wears something short, he tells her she's a woman without values. He wants full control over her life.\n",

      "But he demands constant availability. If she doesn’t reply to his WhatsApp messages within 20 minutes, he gets angry. He sends her voice notes telling her she’ll never find a man like him, and that her friends are the reason she’ll be alone forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s tried to leave him multiple times, but always goes back. He manipulates her emotionally, plays the victim, begs her not to leave. He’s clearly a narcissist. He never apologizes — everything is always *her* fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things worse, she recently confirmed he has at least three other women. She had already suspected it because these women would call and message him constantly when they were together — and he never tried to hide it. He would leave his phone on the table, showing everything. He told her openly that a “real man” has several women, and that men who stay with just one woman are “gay” (in a derogatory way).\n",

      "Body text: My younger sister(24 F) and I(28 F) have such an effed relationship. Growing up, we actually were pretty close and got along well. We grew up in a verbally and physically abusive household with a mother with a personality disorder, so we've always stuck together and had each other's back. When our parents finally split, we became closer, and she was very emotionally dependent on me. In many ways, I have been a parentified child to her as my parents and other family were not safe people for her to ask for help. \n",

We lived in the same area, and I would only see her maybe once every 3-4 months. When she went to college, she went a little crazy as kids do when they are raised very strict. Dated a few abusive assholes, drank heavily, and most importantly started smoking weed heavily. To this day, she smokes weed heavily and I believe she has a problem with it. As of a week ago, i notified my family(minus my mom) about it, and we're currently figuring out how to talk to her about it. \n",

      "It's like there was this personality shift. She to this day is always extremely moody, has horrible delivery,  often lashes out at me when i want to have any conversation about our relationship. She is extremely critical of me, calling me overly emotional, a victim, and annoying. When we get into arguments, nothing is off limits; she has said some of the most hurtful things to me in moments of anger and later will (sometimes) apologize. It feels like she just simply doesn't like me as a person; but when she finds herself in moments of trouble, or needs emotional support I am the singular person she confides in. \n",

Im not saying it just cause, her uni is here (she takes online classes), there are way more opportunities in general (she doesnt even have food delivery to say one). Turns out she doesnt wanna move, she has a full time job rn and doesnt want to leave it and her family. We basically have no future I guess... but we love each other so much, what should I do?

      "\n",
      "I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for a few months. Our relationship started not long after she broke up with her ex, whom she was with for 3 years. At first, things seemed great — we connected deeply and fast. She had and still has some problems With \"lndependence\" In the relatlionship. We also had some discutions about traumas from her past and I've been trying my best to comfort her and be there for her. l did an unintentional mistake regarding consent 2 weeks ago (nothing fully sexual) and this triggered a heavy emotional response in her. This is why this whole thing happening at the moment. Until now i think she repressed her feelings regarding the ex since things were going wonderful between the two of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she opened up to me and told me the full truth:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She still has feelings for her ex, but she doesn’t want to go back to him. (not actual love\" but attachent because of things he helped her with)\n",
      "* She says it’s incredibly hard to detach emotionally, because he was someone who helped her build self-confidence and supported her deeply through a lot.\n",
      "* He still messages her and tells her he loves her — and even though she *wants* to stop talking to him, she feels unable to stop replying and so does he even if he knows that this is toxic for both of them. He sugested that she should try to stop texting since he is unable to.\n",
      "* At the same time, she says she has feelings for *me* but she i is still fighting with the trust that she lost in me after the incident that I mentioned earlier. \n",
      "\n",
      "She is seeing a psychiatrist for quite some time and is now looking for a psychologist as well, because she feels she can’t carry this emotional burden alone anymore.\n",

      "Meanwhile, I feel caught in a limbo. I am waiting to see if she can forgive my mistake. We go through beautiful, intimate moments in these months. We found how similar We are and We are both in awe regarding what a match we are for each other on multiple plans (love, money, hobbies/activities, family, etc.). She also presented me to her parents recently and i also presented her to mine. They said that for the first time in forever she truly seems happy. Now she emotionally pulls away, and I feel her slipping. I'm doing my best to be there for her, to not pressure her, to give her space when she needs it just as she asked of me. I've stopped initiating most of our conversations, and lately she's been the one to reach out .\n",

      "But I’m also afraid that being in a relationship with me might be *adding* to her emotional pressure and confusion. Still, the idea of breaking up terrifies me.

I know this may sound selfish, but I want to remain in her life *as her partner*, not just as someone who helped her in a rough chapter.\n",

      "* What would a therapist likely advise in a situation like this — to pause the relationship, or to continue with boundaries?\n",
      "* Should I distance myself? Stay close but with limits?\n",
      "* How can I support her without emotionally draining myself?\n",

      "* What other advice do you have for me? Has anyone been in a similar situation?\n",

As we get deeper into our relationship we’ve obviously gotten more comfortable, anyways, I like him too much. Hes a top priority in my life, I message him daily, and as soon as I wake up, I let him know what I’m doing all the time, we call every night before bed, I make him stuff all the time (letters, paintings, diy) all kinds of stuff, I try to go all out for holidays and bdays, like I really love him. Anyways we both got new jobs about two months ago and we work the same hours but different jobs, anyways so we don’t msg as much anymore or talk too much throughout the day due to both of us working, and it’s about a 45 min drive from his house to mine and he’s the only one with a vehicle, so we only see eachother on weekends, throughout the week I start to miss him and get upset because he’s so busy all the time and we barely get to talk, I usually express this Wednesday nights I’ll make a comment, Thursday goes the same so I’ll bring it up again, but Thursday night we get into a disagreement and then friday sucks and I finally see him Friday night or Saturday morning, anyways he works 8-4 and then he goes home he calls his friend while he smokes and then he uses the bathroom and does chores that’s about 2-2.5 hours and then he’ll go eat with his dad which a 1-1.5 and then he gets home and he showers which is another hour and it’s usually 930-10pm when he is done and he’ll call me and I’ll try to talk and then he falls asleep and it upsets me because we don’t talk or spend as much time together and I just miss him and want to talk to him and I feel like I make time for him and I’m a full time working single mother to my 1.5 year old daughter and I have no help from her bio dad so I do it on my own and I understand he’s busy but I want to not be so codependent on him, I want to be able to let the man breath because I know I’m clingy but it’s not in a bad way I just literally love and miss him and it causes arguments and I hate that and I want to stop fighting so please anything helps how do I fix this?  I also feel like I put a lot of time into him and our relationship and he doesn’t, and it’s not that he doesn’t do anything he does a normal amount. I do a lot tho, I go all out for bdays and holidays, constantly make him things, buy him stuff I think he’ll like, and I feel like I’m overly obsessed with him and I don’t wanna push him away from being too clingy. \n",

      "Body text: I am going through a divorce and started seeing a partner. We see each other about 2x a week and I usually go to his place which is in a nice area, his apartment building backs up to a Whole Foods and is walkable to trendy area restaurants and bars, 1 bedroom apartment with nice amenities. I love being there. My STBX has recently moved out officially and I invited my new interest over. It was the 1st time he had been to my place in 5 years. I live downtown also around trendy restaurants and bars, close to the sports arena, 2 bedroom, nice city view and back balcony as well. Immediately he started commenting on my stuff. My couch, my tv, my bed, all my stuff. As we were eating dinner money was brought up and he asked how much I make and I told him, and he said “shit!”. And so I asked the question back and he did not give me an answer, but he said I definitely make more than him, and I said “that’s okay, I make more than a lot of people”. It’s not so much about how much someone makes, but how can they manage it and to me he is responsible. He buys his cars cash, we don’t go out a lot and he’s a chef so we still eat well. The conversation got really awkward. That next morning he asked about my toothbrush, “that’s a $200 toothbrush?” I said yeah then he asked about my headphones and he asked how much those were and I told him. Jokingly I said “are you about to rob me?” And he said “no you’re just fancier than I thought”. I wanted to hear more about that and he said that he couldn’t see where he would fit into my life because as a man he’d like to support me but he didn’t know if he could provide more than what I have now. Fair. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I address this to him in a respectful way and tell him I don’t really care about the amount of money, it’s really how much debt/income, your spending habits, etc? He’s stuck on salary and he’s an old fashioned guy. For context we dated when we were 21/19 and he broke with me by playing Drake ft. Rihanna “Too Good” because he felt like he couldn’t support me then. We were kids. So I know this is a soft spot. \n",

      "\n",
      "I (M24) have been dating my boyfriend (M22) for almost two years. We live together and it is the happiest relationship I have ever been in. He is loving, attentive, communicative, and truly incredible. He has both OCD and OCPD, which are both quite well managed and rarely affect our relationship. Something has come up recently though that has caused a road block.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have two online friends who live on the other side of the country (we're in the US). In a few months they are coming to a city nearby us for some family obligations, and messaged me asking if me and my boyfriend (who they've not yet met in person) wanted to get together while they were in town. I haven't seen them since 2023, so I eagerly agreed and we chose to wait until it was closer to the date to figure out specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I brought it up to my boyfriend, he was visibly upset and dismissive. He has spoken to my friends a few times over facetime and via instagram dms, and he has decided that they are people he wouldn't get along with in real life. I pointed out that this was a shallow judgement to make when he hasn't met them in person, and he responded that he is a very good judge of character when it comes to people he will mesh with. He is very polite and cordial with everyone he meets, but he is picky about the people he is friends with, and clashes with intense personalities very easily. He also said that it irked him that my friends hadn't invited him directly, and instead only invited me. He told me that it makes him feel like an accessory to me. I said that they probably didn't reach out to him/both of us because they don't know him as well and didn't want to come off as pushy or overly personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, he mentioned that he didn't want to take the time off work to go and hang out with people that he doesn't know, and that he would rather save money and days off for his birthday, which is later during the month that my friends are coming. We are far from being rich so this part did make sense to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, I told him that I still really wanted to go. He said that if I really wanted to, he would go with me, but that he'd be miserable the entire time. His issue is that if he decides that he's going to have a bad time doing something, he absolutely will. He has quite a negative general outlook on things like this. His OCD is purely obsessive, which for him means that he latches on to negative experiences and is unable to stop thinking about them, to the point of extreme distress.

He cried as he was trying to explain his feelings to me, and I felt awful. I know this post may read as if he is mean and controlling, but he does not want to be this way. Because of his personality disorder, it is not something that he can control. He is in therapy but is quite early in the healing process. \n",

      "Body text: I met my girlfriend over 2 years ago now. Our relationship has been perfect so far. However, my girlfriend is not over her past relationship trauma and it’s affecting us. When we first met, all she did was talk about that relationship and the stuff that hurt her. It was clear she wasn’t over the pain, but I gave it a shot anyway. She overshared a lot of details and there’s a lot of stuff I did not need to know about. Most of it is negative stuff about the relationship, but a lot was also very private stuff I would have been better off not knowing. I feel like this built a very weak foundation of our relationship. \n",

I’m not usually a jealous person and she has been in other relationships and flings before that do not bother me, so it’s not a purity thing. I don’t know what to do. I love her alot and our relationship is perfect apart from this. However, it still hurts me a lot that my partner dragged their previous relationship baggage into this without trying to heal first.

I have always supported her through her journey of growth, but at times I worry a lot about the future and how that could spill into a potential marriage or having kids together. Am I being selfish?

I can’t walk or do anything but the few things I can do, I really really enjoy doing especially when it comes to being able to do them unassisted. He’ll stay over sometimes but when I say that I’m tired and really need a break from everyone he says he gets “hurt” and then flips the conversation like “oh you don’t want me sleeping here at all?” Or “you already have enough alone time from being stuck here”. \n",

He is over every single moment he isn’t working. Even to where he isn’t doing his stuff he claims “isn’t working out” but he just comes over and cancels all his other plans. Even if they are things he should be doing. Like taking care of his own house or whatever. Am I not understanding this? I try to bring it up but I get shut down immediately and he makes me feel guilty. Like I’m abandoning him or something. It’s intense. I need help understanding this please. \n",

      "Body text: I want to preface this by saying that I’m not trying to centre myself in my boyfriend’s pain, and I’m very aware that it’s worse for him than it is for me. I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years. The first year was amazing, he really felt like my soulmate and we would talk about our future all the time. Last fall, some really shitty things that were out of his control started happening. I think he felt really beat down by life, and fell into depression. He told me in February that he hasn't felt happy in months, and he feels depressed and like his future isn't in his control. It breaks my heart to hear this, and I can see it in his personality. He's no longer the outgoing, fun, loving man I fell in love with.\n",

      "I've tried to be supportive, but he keeps pushing me away. He's broken up with me twice so far in 2025, saying he needs to be alone and can't give me what I need. Each time he ends up coming back, the first time after a week, the most recent time after a month. He says he misses me and we basically pick up where we left off, but he never apologizes and I can tell he won't let me fully back in. It feels like our emotionally intimacy has reverted back to the beginning of our relationship, when you’re afraid to talk about anything real. We rarely see each other now, maybe once a week for a few hours as he wants to be alone all the time. We haven’t had sex since February. He never talks about our future, never tells me he loves me unless I say it first, doesn't plan any dates or ever want to go out and do anything, and really just keeps me at an arms length. I'm trying to be supportive, I don't ever give him a hard time about any of what I just said, I give him lots of time apart, I remind him I love him and am here to support him, but it seems like as time goes on he just gets further and further from me.\n",

      "Body text: My (24F) Bf (25M) have been together for 7 years. Lately I’ve been depressed because I don’t know what to do with my situation. It’s hard comparing myself to others but with social media it’s really hard we’ve never traveled even tho I tell him time and time that that’s all I’ve ever wanted. He is currently focusing on making a business and working for himself. In the beginning of the relationship he was consistent with working and did what he needed to do to sustain himself not even me cause I lived with my parents. For the past 2 years he has been very negative about working, I guess working for a boss has made him realize he wants to work for himself which I totally get it I think everyone wants to be there own boss which I told him I totally support. However he quit his job 6 months ago and now I’m basically sustaining both of us and it’s kind of exhausting I wanted to help him, however I see no progress at all. I honestly don’t make that much but it’s enough to survive. I’ve been really stressed because I want to travel and buy myself nice things but because I want to be a supportive gf i want to give him a chance. He talks so nice to me and tells me he’s going to give me the world when his business picks up etc. I don’t know if I’m being impatient or being an asshole .I think I already know what people are gonna say about this situation I still want to know what advice do you guys have should I give him more time or should I think about myself and youth and do things myself btw I don’t have kids so I really can just up and leave but is that being selfish.\n",

      "I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for just under a year now. This is my first relationship where I've ever really felt jealousy, and it’s been confusing and honestly painful. He, on the other hand, is a jealous person and has always been open about that - particularly when it comes to my sexual past. He gets upset if I mention anything about it, and completely shuts down or changes the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weird part is, I’ve always been open, secure, and understanding- never one to feel threatened by a partner's past. But recently I found out something that’s really shaken me.

He only became exclusive once all of those other options fizzled out.\n",

We have great communication, we never fight (except about this), and we’re very compatible emotionally and physically. But this jealousy and feeling of betrayal lingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s making it harder is that he gets angry when I bring up how I feel - he says he hates that I’m jealous now. But then he’ll casually mention or show old photos with girls he used to see, and it just stings. It feels like a double standard: I can’t talk about my past, but he gets to talk about his, and I’m not allowed to be upset about it.\n",

      "The problem began when she started needing to spend a lot of time together. At first, I stayed longer without any issue.

      "Now I know this already sounds bad, but the problem isn’t that he’s grieving, it’s that he’s practically letting everything go. To me it feels like he’s using any problem that comes his way as an excuse to be “lazy”( I don’t know any other way to say it lightly). Prior to this incident, he’s had a series of unfortunate events. For example, His (29F) sister had been arrested and this was a shock to him. That entire week he was down but the thing is, his sister was fine. She had only been in jail for a night but this affected him so much he dropped out of classes. Shortly after, a friend of his sister died in an accident. He had the same response. He shut down and let go of his education yet again when this isn’t technically his problem. He didn’t even know his sister’s friend. And now that his dog is dead, it’s the same thing. Through each incident I have tried my best to be there for him and encourage him to not let go, but he eventually just gives up. He even says that he doesn’t care about these classes, but yet he wants to travel? How do you expect to travel when you don’t have a stable job, and to even get there you need these classes. Maybe it was the way I was raised, but I grew up always being told that people aren’t going to care about your problems. People aren’t going to wait for you, the world is going to keep spinning. So, for him to just let go of his education like nothing? It’s got to a point where I started getting worried about my relationship with him because I’ve dated a person like this before. They had nothing going for them and ended up being an addict. It makes me wonder do I really want to live my life with a man who cares so little about his future? Perhaps I’m being inconsiderate and he truly is grieving . But if that’s the case, how can I understand his grief if it’s effecting his future? I plan on getting married and having kids once I graduate from college. I fear I’m going to live a miserable life if I don’t settle with the right person.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend’s grieving process is concerning. When met with problems, he responds in negative ways that can possibly affect his future, like dropping out of college classes and overall not caring for his education. I need help understanding his grief and worry I’ll settle with the wrong person after graduating. \n",

      "My husband (39m) and I (34f) have been together for 11 years and married 10. I have a son from a previous relationship and he was about 2 years old when we got together. Our marriage, like any, has had some issues over the last decade but nothing that I would consider too damaging. Mostly lack of financial responsibility on his part but we made it work because I believe outside cheating there is nothing we can't overcome as long as there is still love. But I'm also not going to keep chasing someone who doesn't love me, which is why I need a man's perspective. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is why I am concerned:\n",
      "1. Over the last year I have had to initiate 90% of our intimacy. I do not mind doing this, but now he seems annoyed when I try. One recent example is when I tried to get intimate right after I got out of the shower. He got annoyed when I asked him to roll over on his back so I could......do stuff. I ended up going back in the living room.\n",
      "2. Because if the above I have tried to add toys and other things into the bedroom. He has not seemed as interested. Side note: I have asked him what he would like me to do or get. I have gotten no fees back. I have always been the kinkier of the two so this isn't new\n",
      "3. Won't cuddle or initiate affection unless I ask. Once again I don't mind as it has been this way for years, but like I said he now seems frustrated when I ask him to sit by me.\n",
      "4. If I didn't start and continue a conversation we probably wouldn't say much to each other. And honestly he doesn't pay much attention when I talk and zones out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more examples that I can give if needed but the above finally lead me to breaking down yesterday and we had our first fight in a few years. In the end I told him I would no longer be chasing him down for affection and sex. If he wanted to talk, cuddle or fuck he can come to me since I am not sure what I'm doing wrong. Maybe I am asking for too much attention? I feel the closer I try to get to him the more I push him away. But now I'm starting to question if this is the right approach. Any advice or similar stories would be appreciated. I love this man and want our marriage to survive this but I also have some self respect and won't beg him to love me.\n",

      "I (28M) met my girlfriend (29F) about eight months ago. We're in a long-distance relationship, but she's based in Singapore, and I'm living in Japan and originally from Europe.

Meanwhile, she's understandably reluctant to leave Singapore for a country with lower salaries and higher taxes.\n",

      "From the beginning, I was hesitant about doing long-distance. I shared my concerns, but she was very convincing, and I agreed to give it a try. I don't have a lot of relationship experience, so I underestimated how difficult it would actually be. \n",

      "The thoughts of moving again and regretting it or staying without end in sight is tourmenting me.

I tried explaining that despite the salaries the cost of living are lower over here, that it's less expensive to buy houses or raise kids. But she still lives at her parents place so she doesn't know what it's like to pay a rent.\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone. I (25M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (28M) for nearly three years. He’s visited me a few times and spent a lot to make those trips happen, which I’ve always appreciated. I know he loves me. But lately, I’ve been questioning whether we’re really *connecting* emotionally—or if I’m just holding everything together on my own.\n",

      "  \n",
      "From the start, he’s been upfront that phone calls drain him, partly due to his mental health. I’ve respected that. But being long-distance, calls make me feel connected, and I’ve started to feel anxious even asking. When I try, he often responds with short lines like, “What’s up?” or “Was that intentional?” in which makes me question if I’m even welcome in that space.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not asking for daily deep call convos, just a bit more presence. He rarely initiates calls. We text daily, send memes, Tiktoks, etc. But emotionally, it’s starting to feel empty on my end. I’ve also brought up wanting a little public acknowledgment on social media. I don’t expect grand posts, but I’ve had to ask multiple times just to be mentioned. He says he’s not a social media guy, and while I’m learning to accept that, it still stings.  \n",

      "So, I'm in a lesbian relationship, I am 24 and she is 28. We met at work, and we still currently work at the same place. We have been together for 8 months so far.  Both of us live with families so we both agreed to look at somewhere to live together (she was already looking before meeting me). We have even found a house to live in together first viewing and we are actually close to moving in together. She's already starting the mortgage process (I can't get added onto the mortgage yet as I need more time at my work place). \n",
      "\n",
      "So, as we met on day shift, we could make plans together. We spent hours after work sitting and talking together. Started to go to Costa, cinemas, all that stuff. She even allowed me around her house on the early shifts. So during day shifts, it was fine. Then, we both got moved to the night shift about a month and a week ago, and of course, you can imagine that's caused a bit of a problem with us spending time together as it's 10pm-6am and then sleeping in the day. Then, because of the change and also stress of sorting the house, my girlfriend has started to get stressed from that. Now, this is where the problem kind of started. She started to be more quieter at work with me. Always on her phone and barely answering me. Mainly just \"yeah\" \"cool beans\" \"good for you\" so that was hurtful. Then we started to have a few arguments. But some didn't have to happen at all. If I spoke about my feelings or the relationship, it was always turned around to the stress of the house and pushing my feelings and thoughts aside. She eventually started to get more distant from me. Getting a bit colder with me while texting, barely texting me at all through evening or night, and I mean it could be hours because she's \"busy watching her shows\" but sometimes not even a message to ask how I am, ask how I am feeling, say I love you or I miss you, Anything you would do in a relationship. You care about your significant other, right? Though let me add, we do still say I love you and give each other kisses and hugs but it's why it's still a bit confusing. She can be a bit inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now eventually I was getting a gut feeling she wasn't telling me something, so once it all got a bit much for me and I broke down in front of her after work one day. I mentioned it all. The cold replies, ignoring me, constantly on her phone but then says she's \"too busy\" to answer. Then this is where she said she was feeling detached from me and because we can't spend time together, she was getting comfortable with it and she can easily get used to these situations. We spoke about it all in person. She apologised for giving me the cold shoulder. We went home and continued the conversation though text and voice messages. So this is why I made this post in the first place. \n",

She said she thinks moving in together will genuinely help, but still, the uncertainty is there. She did say she would still be my friend and she will still live with me, if it didn't work out romantically.\n",

      "I (25F) am getting really tired of living at home and I fear that there won't be a good enough reason to move out. For context, I'm the oldest of 3 children, I have 2 younger siblings (twins, 23F). I went to college 30 seconds up the road from my high school, so I lived at home in a *very* rural area and commuted for my 4 year degree as that made the most sense financially. However, I felt very restricted since I couldn't come and go as I pleased. Technically I could as long as I communicated my plans to my parents (58M, 58F) (which I'm not good at but that's another story) but as a music major with assignments that required use of our 24 hour recording studio, it was very hard to predict when I'd be able to come home. My mom also is a bit of a helicopter parent and won't sleep unless she knows I'm home or not in a ditch on the side of the road, and she would because she tracks my location for safety (still does).  \n",
      "Anyway, once I graduated I had no immediate plans of moving out but figured that eventually I'd find a job or opportunity that would take me to a city more suitable for pursuing a career in music.

However, this was 2022 and COVID wasn't exactly eradicated, and my main job was 20 minutes away and as related to my field as possible for where I live so I stayed put while I worked on building my career from home on social media, which for an aspiring artist in the 2020's is crucial.  \n",
      "It is now 3 years post-grad and I'm still doing the same thing I was 3 years ago. My sisters are about to graduate from college (both lived off campus) and I do NOT want to live at home with everyone like I've been doing my entire life. I don't work full time but I have the opportunity to move up in our company if I so please I have other side hustles, including streaming on social media which doesn't pay the bills, but does cause me to have a completely different sleep schedule than everyone else along with my other inconsistent work hours, so there's an element of shame there as well since I always get up late. I have a brand new car I'm paying off lightening fast. I can cook, I pay for groceries and takeout for our family of 5 when ends up being around $300 a month, heck I claim myself on my taxes. Too many details here but basically I'm completely independent, except I'm not.   \n",
      "Up until this point you're probably thinking, \"jeez this girl should put on her big girl pants and move out already\", and let me tell you if I thought I could, I would've been out yesterday. This problem I fear lies in my relationship with my mother.  \n",
      "I want to preface that my family is incredibly supportive of me and I of them. My dad (58M) runs a business from our house, of which I help out with, mostly as tech support. My mom (58F) is a teacher as a local elementary school. I also end up helping her with her work, mostly as tech support. My sisters (23F) are both in creative fields like me, but one of them has a disability and needs a lot of physical help. She's an absolute genius when it comes to writing essays, poetry, and scripts, but she can't type them. So, I helped her all through college, being her scribe and tutor. She is now weeks away from being done with school and I'm so thrilled that I won't have to help her anymore. I adore my sister, but I have my own life to live and figured that her graduating was a good transitional period for me to finally gain some autonomy.  \n",
      "HOWEVER, every time I've ever brought up moving away to my parents, I don't get the sense I have their go ahead. I know I in theory don't need permission, but the way our house operates I do. She gets very passive aggressive if things aren't going her way and is the queen of guilt tripping. It's gotten to a point where my sisters and I just go with whatever she wants as to not change the atmosphere of our house for the next several days. So, my strategy is to ween her on to the idea of me moving out. Ideally I'd move somewhere far away (LA is my dream) but with the state of the US economy right now it seems like a terrible idea to go that far. It's obviously cheaper to continue living at home but I don't know if I can take much more. Sorry, I digress. So today we were talking about my cousin (26F) who isn't exactly the savviest of people, but she lives in an apartment and is a full time student. Both her tuition and living expenses are paid for by her parents because she doesn't have a job. I mentioned that I feel like a baby because I'm so capable of living on my own, unlike my cousin, to which my mom responded with something along the lines of \"yeah, but you do so much for us\", to which I replied, \"so are you implying that I can't leave?\" and she didn't respond and kind of moved on to something else. This really shook me and I don't know how to proceed. If I let it go, I'll be living with my parents until I'm 30. If I get a backbone and am assertive about my wants and needs, my relationship with my mom is completely up in the air. I once tried to tell her I knew more about the music industry than her, she asked how I could possible think that, and I said that I spent the last 4 years studying it, and she didn't speak to me for 2 days and I ended up apologizing. I don't know what to do, this can't be the rest of my life. How do I cope or gain the courage to move? All advice appreciated, however \"just do it\" is not helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I (25F) fear my family has become too reliant on me and I'll never feel like I am free to move out of my house without severe repercussions. I'm completely capable and have been sick of being at home for years, but am too afraid to change anything. \n",

      "Body text: I (30 male) been dating my girlfriend (30) for 7 months. We have a great relationship and can see a future together. She is twin and has done everything with sister with her whole life. We live an hour from each other with her growing up in smaller town and I'm just outside a medium size city in the suburbs. She currently lives with her sister and fiancé. We have a few conversations about how it will be very hard to leave her sister one day and doesn't want to be far away. I am very understanding of that and I want to support her. We both said there will have to some compromise when we decide to move in with each other one day and find half way or what works best. Being closer to where I live currently would more ideal since its hard for me to move for my job verse hers since she is a teacher and there always opportunities in any city you move to. Her city is smaller and not much to do and I live in metro area of my city. I understand I would be asking to make a big change and to change jobs potentially but I'm here to support her. I also would have to make a change to potentially with living somewhere different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason why I am writing this post is she makes comments that she will live with her sister for a while and the fiancé found a house they could live together maybe after they are married. It makes me feel somewhat concerned that she thinks she will do the same as her sister. Note her the fiancé grew up in the same town as them. Maybe she is holding on to the idea of living together as long they can together? She is nervous for that kind of change, and I get that but I told her its a good change. I don't want to take her away from her sister but want to create my own life with her one day. I could see getting engaged with 5ish month or so and would hate to get to the moment that this becomes a deal breaker since she doesn't want to move or can figure out what to do. Should I at least see if she sees a future together or is living her town a must? I love this girl and don't want to lose her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not that I would hold it against her for not wanting to move and would change how much I love her. I just want to know if she doesn't then its something we are not compatible on and we aren't right for each other in the aspect. As I said I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her (maybe each 30 minutes away from our towns or need to figure out what the looks like). I don't know if this a deal breaker but overall should I discuss now or when we are closer to get engaged as some point?\n",

      "I M26 have been having some second thoughts about being married to my wife F29, we’ve been together since 2019 and got married 2 years ago. I love her deeply but she is a very manipulative person and I’m constantly told by my friends and family that I should leave her due to her actions, getting upset when I want to hang out with my friends, flat out refusing to go to my best friends baby shower, getting upset and angry that we have to go to any of my family functions, as well as having me apologize for hours on end anytime any of these things upset her.

      "Body text: So I 21f was raised primarily by my extremely abusive mother 37f who I have been no contact with since I ran away to my paternal grandmother's,78f, home 4 years ago. My father 50m was occasionally involved by taking me for food or driving me to my grandmother for the weekend that was supposed to be his custody time I have never stayed overnight with him at his home.\n",

But when it comes to me he is like stone faced, doesn't interact with me directly much always through my grandmother or his friends. He buys me expensive gifts for my birthday and Christmas and although I do not like the amount of money he spends which I have spoken with him about multiple times I enjoy the effort of him getting me a gift if that makes sense?

I just really struggle to see that he cares about me as he does not make effort to spend time with me and I have always been the one to have to initiate contact between the 2 of us.

      "Body text: I'll try to make things short and give a brief overview of my relationship. Me 31M and 30F met almost 12 years ago in my home country on Tinder of all places. My wife was there doing a summer job / internship thing, and we pretty much fell in love from the first night. We didn't leave each other's side for the 3 months she spent there, and before she left, we came to a decision that she'd move there in a year, or I'd move to her country. I took the gamble and moved to be with her earlier, since the job market and perspectives were awful back home anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've now been together 12 years, married 4 years. and we've always respected, loved, and cared for each other very much. We have (until recently) traveled and explored the world together, grew our careers, bought and finished paying our home in full two years ago and are very fortunate, generally speaking. It sounds sappy but if I'm being honest, I've loved her every day of my life since we met and bonded. Our relationship has always been easy, it never felt like work and I still enjoy spending my day with together. It's been happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since last year, things have changed. We started trying for a baby and immediately on the first try, we got pregnant. We were over the moon and I've never felt more loved and happy, I was so excited to be a dad but I was also so happy she was pregnant and felt fulfilled (a recurring issue I'll get into later). A month and a half into the pregnancy, she was told she was being let go from her job (which we ended up reverting because fuck you, we have laws in the EU) and since misery loves company, two weeks later she was told she had a miscarriage and lost the baby before 10 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how to put it into words or writing how I felt, or how much we supported and loved each other. We cried, we embraced, we planned and we talked, discussed and were there for each other. Her pain was understandably different, the whole experience and the trauma of losing that excitement hit hard. But we have always been very open with each other, after grieving and seeking counsel, doctors said it's normal and not to get demotivated, it happens very frequently and there is nothing wrong with us. So at one point, she asked me to find and buy a small angel figurine so we won't forget, and we can close the chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after, I had a shitty injury. Was playing with our dog and threw a ball that bounced over a fence, not even a particularly tall one. I jumped over and when I dropped down, my finger stayed behind, I had what is called a 'ring avulsion' (do not google). So I ended up losing half my finger completely out of the blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this experience broke her, she silently resents me for getting injured. I had PTSD for a while and spent the first couple of months feeling down. This doesn't mean I didn't engage with my family or the world, but I was feeling a bit depressed and ashamed. It got better, but I still would occasionally (like once or twice a month) get a random bout of vulnerability, usually when we were together and I had no other worries on my mind. Eventually, my wife started getting upset and withdrawing when this happened. I had talked to her and told her the therapist I saw for a couple of sessions advised me it can take up to a year until my body processes the change. To her credit, she didn't tell it to my face but I know she felt disappointed I wasn't being manly enough, it's just a bit of finger. But try as I might, I cannot tell you why I grieved that finger so fucking much, it legit felt like a family member died for the first couple weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I feel back to normal for a few months now. It doesn't bother me anymore and I barely can tell a difference between hands. But I still feel guilty I got injured when she was vulnerable and it was still fresh, especially since we kept trying after I got back from the hospital and we can't seem to get pregnant again.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a month and a few weeks now, my wife has been unhappy and withdrawing. She stays on her phone, doomscrolls, doesn't engage or has any spark when with me. At one point, I confronted her and said I don't feel like it is okay to be this way, and she confessed she feels lost, without a purpose and unhappy, that our connection is different and feels lost. It culminated in her taking a vacation we planned together to Hawaii, the first half of it all expenses paid for two (she won it through work), which she forfeited so she could go alone. She said she needed this time to feel 'normal' about me again, and that the time apart would do us good. So I relented, I didn't agree but I respected her wish. For those two weeks, she barely made an effort to talk to me or anyone in our family, I had to actively try to reach out to her, but did tell me it was helping and that she doesn't want to break up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked her up from the airport today and I let everything go, all the hurt, I just miss her. It makes no sense to dwell on something I ended up agreeing to, anyway. And honestly, I had a good time by myself too, it was a real growth moment for me to know I can be alone worst comes worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing seems to have changed. She's still awkward and withdrawing, she doesn't  have the initiative to give affection, even after I made clear the expectation I need affection, and she started crying after we got home and settled down, that she still doesn't 'feel'. I also found it sweet but strange she was wearing her wedding ring and her engagement ring, it's not usual behavior after my injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think there is any other motive behind it, there is no other man, or anyone else. We're not having intimacy issues, on the contrary, it's been really exciting and good for a few months (but we never really had issues there). She had previously confessed she feels trapped and unhappy, and guilty that I do things and sacrifices for her. But I don't expect anything in return, I always made it clear, so I don't understand where this is coming from. And looking back a bit, she has often struggled with feelings of not belonging, people not liking her, of not having a purpose in life or feeling accomplished, becoming avoidant and running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her end, she complained I had become too reliant on videogames and got grumpy because of last year, which I didn't realize and apologized. I took steps and have reduced my video game time from like 10-12h a week to half or less, and took up most of the housework since I work from home all week and usually have less work than she does (we both don't enjoy it, but it has to get done. It's a decision I took, I don't regret it or hold it against her).\n",
      "\n",
      "She also told her parents she needed these two weeks apart, because I was not 'present' or worried every time the test came back negative, and that she isn't 'feeling me'. That, to me, was the most shocking thing, because I thought I was expressing my feelings (of course I was fucking sad), and also, that it became such an important 'thing' and she didn't even bring it up with me. We had discussed and agreed we wouldn't stress and keep trying for the first year and if it didn't work out, it's alright, we'd go get tested for fertility issues. Look I know this is wrong to say, I shouldn't judge her feelings, but I was hurt by that, I'm a dedicated partner and husband and I'd like to know if I did something wrong, there was no indication beforehand and I did not act in a way that would be uncaring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I wrote a lot but I'm lost. I have suggested and expect therapy, for both. It came out of nowhere, at no point did my wife signal issues in our relationship or asked me to make a change, no discussion, nothing. I thought everything was okay, and now I resent her for not talking to me and not working on things. I don't want to get to that, but I have looked at moving out of our home and that made me ugly cry, but at this point I don't know if I can do anything else, if things don't get better, I'm stressed as fuck. Any advice?\n",

      "My parents have been overbearing with me about our relationship and how she has a lot of 'red flags' (the big thing they're pointing out is how she doesn't dress feminine *she grew up in the country while I was a suburban kid* and I dont mind)  My parents also tell me that other people has concerns but when I ask who, they won't disclose it. And this all has taken a toll on me that I almost broke up with my GF last night.\n",

And I've learned that whenever I'm away, she isn't included in any conversations my family has and that they are rather judgmental of her while I'm not present.\n",

      "Body text: i'm 27m and my gf is 26, we've been together for 6 months. i'm upset how controlling my gf is right now. idk what's going on in her life, but lately my female friends from work or my previous workplace always chats me almost everyday. i don't have any feelings for them and they don't too. they just bored and chats me when they want. i let my gf sees the messages, but now she's mad at me. she said why would i regularly text with them while i think it's fine. everyone can chats me anyway. but she questioned why would i never hang out with boys and she triggered by my answer where i said i'm easily to have female friends rather than male friends. she was being cheated on in the past and i feel like she's projecting in onto me. i'm not doing anything and i can't ask all the girls to stop chatting me just because my gf wants it. i respect her, but by asking me to have boundaries (tell them to not regularly chats me) as she is, only makes me feel i'm controlled. she's indeed never force me to not having female friends, but by her reaction is like she doesn't want me to have it. eventhough that one girl is my coworker that i'll meet everyday, doesn't mean i wanna hook up with her. and my gf also mad at me that i'm buying stuff or treat lunch/dinner my female friends in the office eventhough it's not as frequent as she thought. i feel like it's nonsense my gf mad at me for unimportant messages from my female friends. i mean, we can be friends with opposite gender too while we're on relationship and i'm not giving any attention to that girl, i'm just replying their messages. i love my gf tho and i wanna live with her because she's such a loving girl and want to do anything for me. but we argue about this almost every week. how to deal with this kind of issues?\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been talking to this girl (F18) for about 7 months online, and we’ve gotten really close during that time. We’ve had a lot of deep conversations and shared a lot about our lives. We met in person for a week recently, and things escalated really fast. We ended up getting intimate, and now I’m stuck in my head about everything.\n",

      "She’s had a rough background, including bullying, health issues, family problems, and dropping out of school. She’s emotionally intense and has some insecurity. Since we met, she’s been messaging me constantly, bringing me up in nearly every conversation, and always asking to watch things or play games together. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. It’s hard to explain, but it feels draining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is, most of our relationship has been online, and meeting in person made everything feel more serious. I don’t want to hurt her, but it feels more serious to me than it is. I think I may have given her mixed signals, not slowing things down or setting proper boundaries. I agreed to things I wasn’t sure about, and now I feel like I rushed things and regret some of it. I’m trying to focus on my studies and getting my life together, but this whole situation is making me feel stuck.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context:\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n",
      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",
      "* We originally got her as a puppy (4 months). She is over a year old now. \n",
      "* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n",
      "* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n",

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend (17F) and I (17M) have been together for 2 years — one year long-distance and one year living together. It’s been a rollercoaster, and honestly, I’ve changed a lot for the better over time, but I’m at a point where I feel torn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in September, I made a mistake. It wasn’t cheating, but it was a serious lie. She almost left me over it, and her mom even sat me down to talk about it. I felt incredibly guilty and promised I’d change and work every day to earn her trust back. Since then, I’ve done everything I could to be the best version of myself — emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’ve been more patient, more giving, and constantly trying to support her through everything. Even before I had fully grown as a person, I helped her out of a difficult home situation. I supported her move-in, helped her find a job, and always tried to put her well-being first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got complicated when my mom eventually kicked her out. I chose to leave with her, and in the heat of the moment during an argument between me and my mom, things escalated. My mom lashed out at me physically — hitting me on the head and pulling my hair. My girlfriend intervened to protect me, but that led to a fight between them. Looking back, it was just a toxic mix of emotions. Everyone was in the wrong — my mom for lashing out, my girlfriend for escalating it, and me for not diffusing the situation better. But now my girlfriend is asking me to cut my mom off completely, and after losing my dad not long ago, it’s incredibly hard for me to just walk away from the only parent I have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my dad passed, my girlfriend and I were staying at a homeless shelter with her mom and siblings. My cousin later took us in, and for a while things felt more stable. But because of the fight with my mom, my mom’s mom (my nana) was staying downstairs at my cousin’s, and my girlfriend didn’t want me going down to see them. At first she allowed short visits, but eventually she stopped me from going down at all. One day my mom made a long drive just to see me, but I wasn’t allowed to go down and see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions really blew up one night during an argument when my girlfriend started throwing things and yelling. My nana came upstairs and calmly asked her to quiet down because it was late, but my girlfriend felt disrespected and snapped at her. She later asked me why I didn’t defend her. This became a common pattern — anytime she felt “disrespected” by someone (my cousin, my nana, etc.), she expected me to defend her no matter what, even if she was the one being harsh first. And if I didn’t, it became an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a time my friend came over after my dad passed, and we drank and smoked together. It was one of the first times I had laughed and felt a bit of peace since my dad’s death. My girlfriend said I left her for my friend (she’s in our room the room right next to he living room) and made a huge deal out of it, even though I was constantly checking in on her and she had been asleep for most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, things got so tense between her and my cousin that my girlfriend called her family to come pick us up. My cousin informed my nana, and the situation escalated so much that the police got involved. We got separated, but I convinced my cousin to take me to see her again during spring break. I wasn’t planning to break up with her — I just wanted to see her. But when the time came to return, things didn’t go as planned, and we ran away together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were truly homeless at that point, sleeping in parks at night. I couldn’t go with her to her mom’s shelter because I wasn’t her biological child and social services wouldn’t allow it. We had no options until my grandpa stepped in and helped us out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue that’s been hurting me lately is how my girlfriend made me unadd my step-sister. I’ve known her since I was 8 and she was 6 — she’s my family. But my girlfriend doesn’t accept that, claiming she’s just “a female best friend.” I even explained the whole family dynamic to her — how my stepdad raised them when their biological dad wasn’t around — and my whole family would back me up. Still, she told me to tell my stepbrother I didn’t want Hannah (my step-sister) in my life anymore. She’d even ask me if I was bothered by what she mad me do, also that her sister backed her up and her family usually backs her up even if it seems wrong sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, when I visited my mom and got home at 7 PM instead of earlier, my girlfriend blew up. My mom works nights and sleeps during the day, she was mad I didn’t come home at 10AM or 12PM and I was just happy to visit and reconnect. But she turned it into a problem. Later, my step-sister tried to add me on Snapchat, and I declined the request without blocking her. My girlfriend found out and flipped out, saying I was a bad boyfriend for not blocking her entirely. Her mom got involved too, saying “If my daughter’s ex added her and she didn’t block him, would you be mad?” — even though Hannah is my step-sister, not an ex. My girlfriend didn’t correct her, and I just stayed quiet to keep the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expects me to do everything with her — if I smoke a disposable without her, it’s an issue. She even comes to the bathroom with me. I don’t mind doing most things together, but I need my own space sometimes, and she struggles to understand that. On Mother’s Day, I simply texted my mom “Happy Mother’s Day,” and she got mad, saying her mom actually deserved it more. My mom has apologized for a lot of things, and I’m trying to rebuild that relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve made huge changes. I’ve been more honest, more stable, and more committed than ever. But sometimes my girlfriend still brings up the mistake I made a long time ago, even when I’ve expressed how deeply those old mistakes haunt me. I’ve done everything I can to earn forgiveness, but it still feels like I’m being punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part is that I love her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want her to be with anyone else. But I’m starting to feel like I don’t have freedom anymore. I’m being made to choose between her and my mom, and after losing my dad, that choice feels impossible. I’ve sacrificed so much, and part of me wonders if I’ll ever be able to fully have both love and peace at the same time.\n",

She wants me to cut my mom off, and after losing my dad, that feels impossible. I’ve changed so much, but she still brings up old mistakes and expects me to do everything with her, even giving up people I’ve loved and known for years. I love her deeply, but I’m starting to feel suffocated. I don’t know how to choose between love and family, or if I even should.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend (22M) of almost 5 years gets very defensive when I (21F) cry\n",
      "Body text: I’m a very depressed person and I cry A LOT. Often everyday. I also quit using nicotine a few weeks ago so I have been crying plenty more than usual (like for several hours at a time). Needless to say, I am just very sad. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mother is very emotionally intelligent and has always been extremely supportive when I am upset. My boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from a family that was not so supportive and would meet displays of emotion with anger. We’ve been together for almost five years and I could count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen him cry— he definitely sees it as a sign of weakness and never wants me to look at him when he does. Because of his upbringing, he has no real ability to empathize and no skills with processing emotions. I believe he’s also been taught to think that anger is a normal and rational response when somebody is sad. It also seems as though there was lots of passive aggression in his household growing up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every single time I cry, he takes it personally and gets angry with me, or at least gets very very defensive. I always try to explain that it really has nothing to do with him and it’s not a personal attack, I just want some comfort or emotional support. Like, for example, when I cry about being lonely, he thinks I’m “giving him shit” for not spending enough time with me. Usually by the end he understands where I’m coming from, but it always has to come after a huge nasty fight where I usually end up just comforting him. He seriously has zero empathy when he sees me sad and is often very very mean, mimicking me and using an angry tone which obviously makes me cry harder. I can also see his face harden each time, like his eyebrows furrow in anger; when I tried to explain to him that my mothers face would soften when she comforted me, he genuinely didn’t understand what I meant by that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even when I was crying on the one year anniversary of my father’s death, no comfort. Not even a hug until I ask for one. It was so disheartening because it was the exact same thing as the year prior when my father died. My crying turned into an argument. When I asked why he didn’t comfort me, he said it was because I hadn’t blown my nose, and he was really grossed out. That was one of the most painful exchanges we’ve had. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love him so much and told him I’d rather work really very hard to understand each other and make this work rather than break up. I can see how these patterns come from his childhood and it just makes me want to hug little six-year-old him so bad. He’s never been allowed to be in touch with his emotions so of course it would be difficult. He’s not a bad guy at all. He’s fantastic and I know he cares about me. It’s just so discouraging for this pattern to continue when I have been begging him for years to please just offer me some emotional support sometimes and stop inserting himself into every situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also says he feels helpless when somebody is crying. He truly does not know how to provide comfort or make a safe space. I’ve tried to show him what that kind of comfort feels and looks like in all the times I’ve done it for him, but he never seems to pick up on it. He says he doesn’t know what to say, which makes me sad because I’m deeply hurt to see somebody upset and the words just come naturally at that point. I feel like that’s the nature of empathy. He truly lacks empathy. \n",

      "TL;DR: My boyfriend’s emotions were met with anger as a child, and now he meets mine the same way. How can I help him to break this cycle?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: there are a few things I feel inclined to clarify. Although I cry often, I do not expect to be comforted every single time I cry. The majority of these times are when I’m in the shower, or doing household chores alone. It is not normal for me to cry for hours. This is a recent response to withdrawal and is temporary. He also knew I’d face depressive symptoms when I quit, but encouraged me anyways because he understands it will be beneficial in the long run. I do NOT expect quitting to “fix” me. I do NOT expect my boyfriend to “fix” me. If that’s what you gather from this, I urge you to reread. A major part of depression is feeling like your emotions are burdensome to those around you and I very much experience that. I do a lot of journaling. The only time I will cry to my boyfriend is when I think it’s something we should address, or when it’s something huge and devastating, like my father’s death. Telling me I’m exhausting to be around doesn’t make a positive impact on anybody. I only want positive change. I do not expect him to fully understand my emotions either, but this is what you must understand— he has NEVER comforted me for any reason, because he has hardly ever received comfort. His response is almost always anger. I’m not asking for him to be my constant emotional support. I’m more so looking to HELP him (not force him) feel comfortable with emotions in general. I think it’s also worth noting that he has said on multiple occasions his favorite thing about me is the way I work through our emotional discussions. I wouldn’t be asking for this advice if we hadn’t both acknowledged it’s something we’d like to work on together. Please be kind. \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 2: I hope one day we, as a society, can move away from blaming women for everything and move towards providing help for men who are in clear emotional distress. This post was not made in regards to my mental health. My crying is not the issue, as my boyfriend wants to be better equipped to help me when I am sad. He wants to be able to express emotions as comfortably as I do. This is where I’m seeking advice and nowhere else. Thank you to the kind people who understood that. \n",

      "Body text: As the title says for the most part. For context she lost her dad when she was 10 and hasn’t been in an environment that would allow her to work on it. Her mom is the ultra religious “If you have something wrong with you or are depressed you aren’t praying enough or God is punishing you” type so she understandably hasn’t opened up to her mom about it. She has dealt with mild suicidal ideation in the past but never to the point of making a plan. Probably 4/7 days of the week she is incredibly depressed and exhausted and doesn’t want to do anything but sleep. She has a car that is almost (but not quite) paid off that I have recently paid half the remaining balance for to help her out. She doesn’t believe she is able to move out yet because her car isn’t functional at the moment and she doesn’t believe she makes enough money. \n",

      "Late last year I convinced her to go to therapy, and I started therapy concurrently. She was iffy about it because she thought her mom would disparage her because of it. Strangely enough her mom didn’t say anything bad about it. However when her mom gets upset she will jab at her about the therapy and how she isn’t healed yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was doing ok and starting to understand her emotions and that her living situation with her mom was abusive, and even recently applied for and got accepted to a new nursing related job. She has been wanting to do nursing most of her life so I was very excited for her, but her mom quickly started peppering her with questions and making her doubt her decision. \n",

      "This brings us to the present. She has recently been incredibly stressed with the end of the school year and finals coming up so I’ve been helping her as best I can. But she has been incredibly depressed over the past few months  and has thrown all of my ideas and help out the window. Her therapist taught her several coping skills to self regulate but she refuses to use any of them unless I ask her to try. She refuses to talk to me for several hours at a time and only responds to tell me she doesn’t want to talk. I suggested that she get evaluated for clinical depression and she agreed with that idea, but refuses to schedule an appointment with either her pcp or an evaluator because she doesn’t want her mom to find out. She also explicitly stated “I kinda just want to go get screened and take the meds and hopefully fucking die from it.”\n",

      "Body text: Hi all my partner M 23 and I F 21 have been going through a pretty rough patch for a while now and I’m I feel like I’m hanging on by a thread. We’ve been together about 3-4 years\n",

      "\n",
      "I’ll give you some context; Christmas 2023 I found out I was pregnant, I wanted to keep Bubs but my partner didn’t. I reassured him that what he wants to do is absolutely his choice and I’d never hold it against him. He stayed but not without a lot of fighting about it, still to this day he speaks as if I’ve baby trapped him, I never wanted him to feel that way, this was an accident I never did it on purpose! \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward a bit, I’m about 9 months pregnant about to pop at any minute, he went through my entire phone inc my snap memories from before he was even around, he found some snaps I must of sent to a friend talking about sleeping with a guy with a massive shlong, I don’t really remember what I had said in those snaps but I know it’s not something a partner would want to see. I tried to reassure him that it wasn’t that good and it actually hurt a lot and I couldn’t enjoy myself, so I never saw him again. My partner is quite big and previously about a year or two before, he asked if he was the biggest I’d been with, I said he was because I know most men wouldn’t wanna hear that you’ve been with bigger. I know that when he saw those snaps he knew I lied, yet he wouldn’t believe me that it hurt and I didn’t enjoy it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over my pregnancy my body had changed so much, I’ve always struggled with body image so this was really heartbreaking. I was at about 54kg when we met and I probably got to about 100kg while pregnant. That and all the stretch marks I had gained I wasn’t feeling great about myself. When my partner and I met he found porn on my phone and wasn’t too pleased so I never watched it again until I found him watching it. I confronted him and explained that it made me uncomfortable that I wasn’t allowed to but he was, it was never a big deal until I got pregnant and he didn’t feel like I wanted to have sex as much as I used to (I was just tired, sore and insecure). When I was 9 months about to pop, just after he found snaps from before his time, I found porn on his phone again, this time it really upset me as he had a million tabs of all different girls that looked nothing like me. I cried and cried and cried to him about it and how it really upset me, yet he continued to do it, the day before I was induced he watched it. After I had Bubs he watched it. And now I’m 8 months postpartum still haven’t lost the weight (I know, my own fault) he still watches it! I’ve broke down a million times about how it was making me feel yet he still does it. We have videos we’ve made he could watch but chooses not to because he likes to say that “it’s research” because he doesn’t believe that I didn’t like the really big dick from before him and I were together because all girls in porn love it and all girls on reddit say they love it and that I’m lying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other excuses he uses is that I don’t make him feel wanted therefore he can’t look at videos we’ve made together, so he just wants to look at sex as just sex. Yet will look up specific girls because he likes their “style” of video. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just feel like I’m at a dead end. I don’t know what to do, he keeps promising he won’t do it again until I catch him and he always tries to play it cool like he wasn’t watching so I ask to see his phone and there it is every single time. Every time he gets caught him basically flips it and blames it on me. Because he didn’t want this life and that I slept with someone bigger before him and lied to him about it. Mind you he’s slept with 10x the amount of people I’ve slept with. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry if that was a little confusing and all over the place I’m a little scattered as I just had a medication abortion last night, 10 minutes before I was supposed to take my medication I was taking care of Bubs and went to cook some dinner and went to ask if my partner wanted some and I caught him watching porn again! Right before I was supposed to take him medicine. It all just took me back to right before labour with my son dwelling on the fact I just caught my partner watching porn again, I felt so unsupported and not like myself. \n",

      "\n",
      "This all started with me (17M) and my friend (16M) when we dated long distance for a year. For context, we met online when we were younger, and we ended up getting closer around a year or two ago. I am on the aroace spectrum and I’ve never been in a relationship before we got together. I’m also a huge doormat, which is where majority of my problems came from. At some point, we started dming more, and I convinced myself I had a crush on them after they confessed to me. It was an awful thing to do and I wish I hadn’t jumped into the relationship so fast just because I liked them so much as a friend, because it was deeply unfair to them. I struggle with differentiating platonic and romantic feelings, but that was my fault. The thing is, this friend was also very impersonal when we dmed before we dated. We talked about shared interests and general stuff, but not much personal stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "This ended up changing after we got together. Now back then at the beginning, I used to be a chronic over sharer and I was in a phase where I thought my parents were a lot worse than they actually were, so my friend (or then partner) ended up comforting me through a lot of stuff. I appreciated it a lot and all of that went well. Over time though, they started talking to me about what they were going through, and obviously I was open to hearing and trying to comfort them. I had previously dealt with suicidal thoughts, and they had them, so I tried to comfort them and help them feel heard. However, what used to be somewhat rare conversations began to be almost nightly. We also had a time zone difference, so on school nights I would be up very late trying to talk them through stuff because I cared and wanted to help. They struggled with opening up to people, so I wanted to help as much as I could and they said I was the only person they wanted to talk to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the part I don’t like admitting. At some point, I just started dreading conversation. I’d feel a pit in my stomach when they messaged me. Because they ended up telling me most of what I said actually made them feel worse. And I know it was on me, and that I tend to jump to immediate solutions instead of reassurance, but after so many nights with two hours of sleep wholeheartedly believing I had done something for them, something messed me up. I started getting straight up anxious when they told me stuff. I started overthinking like crazy on everything I said and I hated talking in general. By that point I had already been withdrawing when it came to talking about a lot of personal stuff with me because it felt unfair that I had been comforted time and time again and in return I wasn’t able to do anything for them. They were also someone that needed frequent reassurance, and I am very forgetful and at that point in my life was busy a lot of the time, so I wasn’t able to provide what I should have been able to. There was just constantly so many mistakes I had made unintentionally, and when I finally found out, it was after they were made multiple times. I didn’t know how to fix them either, because as much as I wanted to be reassuring I didn’t know what that looked like. \n",
      "\n",
      "After they brought up something again one day, the conversation ended up naturally leading towards us breaking up. I will say that they communicated much more about what they liked and didn’t like, and that was very appreciated and mature of them. But I ended up finally breaking things off because as much as I liked them, it genuinely felt like I was simply useless to them. I couldn’t understand what they had even initially liked about me after all that time, and it felt like being in a relationship was disingenuous. Now, we have gone back to being friends, but we still talk like how we used to before. Here is where things get a little worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I mentioned earlier, they need frequent reassurance and chronically overthink. I myself am someone that avoids one on one messaging with almost everyone, from friends to people I hate. I find it a chore and exhausting when it’s just small talk. However, since they mentioned they wished I had done that more, I started doing that after we went back to being friends. I thought at least if I could fix my mistakes from then like this, it would be okay. But now I’m stuck in the same cycle I was before, where we’re always messaging and they usually are struggling with something and I try to help them but I’m starting to secretly resent them and I feel awful for it. They can’t get access to therapy or talk to any adults so that is out of the question, which means I’m the only person that can do something for them. I’ve completely stopped sharing my own stuff because I know all too well how scary it is hearing how badly someone thinks about themself and not being able to get them to see how you feel, and I just can’t say anything in good conscience. I’m starting to get annoyed when they check in with how I’m doing and if I’m ok because I don’t WANT them to check in on me or comfort me anymore. I feel sick thinking about them trying to help me when they have so much going on. I care about them so much as a friend, but I’m scared that one day my flimsy attempts at comfort won’t be enough, and they’ll finally do something drastic. I just wish out of all the people in the world that they liked enough to share their feelings with, it wasn’t me, because I’m such an awful candidate to get comfort from. I don’t want to go more in detail because I don’t want them to ever find this, but if anyone has advice or anything, I’d really appreciate it. \n",

I needed to go to therapy, but my boyfriend didn't want me to and threatened to leave me if i did. I felt so weak i couldn't bear the thought of being left alone in that state, so i started to see a therapist anyway without telling him only because the situation has gotten really bad, so bad i was scared to sleep, breathe, being alive. I needed to take anti-anxiety medications everyday just to survive until the end of the day without losing my mind (obviously he was against me taking anxiety medications too, so i never told him that i took them just like i never told him about therapy). The thought of going out terrified me, the only thing i was able to do was eating so consequently I gained a LOT of weight. \n",

I'm taking care of myself again after a long time: i wash myself regularly, i do my makeup, i'm now fully capable of going out again and most importantly i reorganized my room (which is a huge thing for me). i'm still in therapy and i really see the positive changes that it's bringing me. \n",

He's really fond of all the animals he takes care of, but he was particularly attached to the first two owls that passed away, they were two months old brothers and we both took care of them since they were able to open their eyes, sleeping with them and all in order to imprint them. As you can imagine, this series of events has taken a toll on him. When the little owls died, for a brief period, our relationship has gotten better since we were both grieving but surprise surprise, while i still feel drained since they passed away, he got back to his old antics in a heartbeat, only now he's worse. \n",

Based on this mindset alone, i can clearly tell he's not fine at all, but he won't admit it and it's best for me not to even try to make him dig deeper into his own feelings or else it would make him mad and he would make sure to escalate things into a huge fight and i really don't have the strength to endure it. \n",

      "Body text: TL;DR So me 30M started talking to a coworker at my office 24F back in January, things went smoothly and pretty well, we were talking daily, she would send me pictures of her and everything. So i asked her out and took her to a nice place here in my city, with a nice lookout and park, we drank some wine that i brought with me and talked about everything non stop from 6pm till 11pm, that's when we decided to go to a karaoke. Before taking the cab we got really close and that was my cue to kiss her, i took her hair out of her neck, she allowed it, but for some reason i couldn't move on to kiss her and that kinda makes me angry with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that date she was kinda cold and wouldn't talk so much anymore, some days later she was back to normal, so i took her to lunch and asked her out again, she said ok and i picked a nice place. Happens she got a ride opportunity to go to her hometown Thursday, our date was going to happen Friday. She told me about that and said we would do it when she was back, shes going to spend about 15 days there. Since then thing went pretty cold and that made me anxious, i try to give her space and not disturb, but at the same time i wanna talk to her and when i do she takes sometime to respond and wont go on with the conversation. I really hope thing go back to normal when she returns, cuz i really grown to like her a lot and i wonder what should i do in this situation, iam usually a rational guy, but for some reason she made me pretty emotional.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR:\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been dating my boyfriend (22M) for over a year and I’m emotionally exhausted. He constantly compares our childhoods, makes impulsive financial decisions, relies on others (including me) for money, doesn’t listen to my needs, and makes me feel like I have to be his therapist. I care about him, but I feel numb and unsure if I can keep doing this. I need advice.\n",

      "Hi Reddit,\n",
      "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for a little over a year. We’re long distance for now, but I’m moving back to my home state this week and lately I’ve been questioning if this relationship is still right for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the biggest issues I’ve been struggling with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. He compares our upbringings constantly.\n",
      "I had two parents and a stable home. He had a single mom and grew up with more financial struggle. Anytime I mention my childhood, he says “must be nice being rich” and then brings up his own struggles. I can’t even talk about innocent memories without him guilt-tripping me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. He’s emotionally demanding when he’s sick, but doesn’t care when I am.\n",
      "I buy him medicine, help him feel better, and stay present. But when I’m in pain, especially during my period, all he says is “sorry.” Once when I was getting my hair done and picked him up from the airport while he was sick, he got upset that I wasn’t talking enough to distract him from his pain—despite me already doing everything I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. He criticizes things I like.\n",
      "I like Disney, animals, and Beyoncé. He’s said those things are cringey. When I mentioned liking wine, he immediately said “wine’s not even good,” despite doing a wine tasting with his family and enjoying it. Meanwhile, I never judge his interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. He’s financially unstable and impulsive.\n",
      "He’s $60K in debt, being sued for $3K, and doesn’t have a paying job. His grandma passed and left him $6K, which he spent on a camera lens for a hobby he doesn’t get paid for. He joined expensive track teams with no transportation plan and had to beg family for train fare. He even asked me for $10 to put his music on Apple Music.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. He won’t work and his mom enables it.\n",
      "She won’t let him get a real job because he helps with her law firm’s social media. She doesn’t pay him. When he tried applying to Lowe’s, she threatened to kick him out. So he’s financially dependent on others and doesn’t take real steps to change it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. He wants me to be his therapist.\n",
      "When two friends told him they felt used and cut him off, I asked how he felt and tried to comfort him. Later that night, he said I wasn’t “soft enough” and didn’t walk him through his emotions. He said he wanted me to “feel how he feels like he would with a client” (he wants to be a therapist one day). I’m not emotionally cold, but I don’t like being emotionally forced.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. He doesn’t put real thought into gifts.\n",
      "He buys me stuff I don’t like (wrong colors, scents, styles) even after I’ve told him my preferences. He promises flowers and never follows through. Yet I’m thoughtful with everything I get him. It just feels one-sided.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. He uses God to excuse a lack of planning.\n",
      "I told him we both need financial stability before talking about marriage. He said, “We don’t need money, we need Jesus.” I believe in God and I’m growing spiritually, but I also believe in taking action. It feels like he shames me for wanting stability and planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. He tries to change me.\n",
      "He’s said I should be more talkative, more emotional, wear more makeup, get my nails done, and be more like his ex spiritually. I feel like I’m not enough as I am. I’ve become numb because I’m always trying to defend who I am instead of just being loved for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I care about him deeply, but I feel like I’ve been carrying the emotional, financial, and spiritual weight of this relationship—and I’m tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I stay in this relationship and keep hoping he’ll grow?\n",
      "Or am I holding onto something that’s no longer working?\n",

      "Title: I (21F) have issues with my boyfriend’s (22M) female friends\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend and I are in college and have been dating for over a year. I have always known that he has a lot of women friends due to him growing up with mostly women. I am not used to this because I don’t have guy friends. We’ve had countless discussions and sometimes arguments about the nature of his friendships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst case was with a girl who he had a fling with before me. They had agreed to be friends before we started dating but once I found out, I said I wasn’t comfortable with that and he agreed to stop talking to her. (Context: it was super uncomfortable because she was in a situationship with a taken man). Sometime goes by and she reaches out to him to which they have a conversation that he didn’t tell me about. He also had her notifications silenced on snapchat and they had a short streak. I found out and made it firmly known that them talking was uncomfortable for me and inappropriate in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another case where he had some push back was with another female friend who I did not know and had grown a dislike to. She is very boy centered which has been confirmed by her ex friend who said that they ended their friendship because of a boy. I’ve seen her interactions with other guys which come off as flirtly. Personally, she was rude to me in a stressful situation which is why I don’t like her. I asked my boyfriend to distance himself with her which is where he kind of pushed back on me because he didn’t want to avoid hanging out with a certain group of people because she would be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, time passed until now when the conversation of him changing how he speaks and acts around friends has changed since we’ve started dating. I ask him to elaborate and he says that he doesn’t talk about sex or anything of the sorts with friends anymore. I could tell that he was lying or that he was trying to give his best answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I ask him about the conversations he has with his women friends. I ask about a girl who he has known since middle school and their only mode of communication is texting. I feel like he tries to make me feel guilty for asking and he said that they have been talking about her terminally ill family member. He then goes on to talk about another girl, unprovoked, who I know and trust and how she is dealing with the passing of a coworker.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then ask about a women who has been texting him more often recently. He lets me read their instagram DMs and before opening it he says “you’re not gonna like what you’re gonna see”. The convo starts with her sending a “fact” slideshow about doggy style which he says was relavent to a previous conversations (not on insta). I am not disappointed in the girl but my boyfriend because he asks “why don’t you like doggy? it’s too 3 for me”. the girl seems reluctant to answer and says “idk idk”. My boyfriend then asks what her top sex positions are to which she ends the conversation by not answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after saying that I wouldn’t like the message, his reasoning for asking that was that he wanted to keep the conversation going.  But never have I or any of my girl friends imagined telling a guy friend about their favorite sex positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend is mostly perfect in every other way but when it comes to his women friends, I feel like he has no “manners” when it comes to thinking about me. What do I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I have issues trusting my boyfriend’s female friends. He has kept secrets about ex-flings reaching out. There was also a boy-centered friend who I didn’t like that he did not want to completely cut off. Now I found out that he had asked a female friend about her favorite sex positions after saying that he doesn’t talk about sex with his friends. \n",

      "Body text: Bear with me while I provide some context. I 30M with 6M son lost my partner / his mother about a year ago to cancer. We had an on and off relationship but she was my kids mother and I loved here. Needless to say her passing devastated us both. Fast forward a year and I have been talking romantically with a 31F who has a 3F daughter. We have been acquainted for almost two months. I feel a strong connection with her, I feel my son and I both need a woman in the house/ around and from what I have seen she is a good mother/ person. Back to me.. even before my son’s mother passed I have always experienced high highs and low lows from day to day. Since her passing this has been extremely amplified. Some days I feel great. Other days I can hardly muster the energy to get out of bed. On days that I feel good, I am on the phone or texting with this woman constantly through the day. I am positive, funny and attentive. On my bad days, I am basically unresponsive. I have little to contribute and don’t want to sit on the phone with someone when I am in such a negative space. She thinks I am shut down because of her somehow which is not the case. I typically just tell her I am tired and feel “out of it.” She wants me to express my feelings but I can not do that without feeling like I am bi****** and when I do talk about my feelings it often makes me feel weak and vulnerable especially with someone I have only known a few months. I think if I want this relationship to turn into anything I will eventually need to open up but is a beaten down widower really something someone would find attractive? I think not. I feel I need to portray a stable and confident mask if I want someone to look at me as a strong and capable man. This is why I often choose to suffer in silence. I am not sure what the next steps are. I do not want to lose her but also do not feel like I am ready to let her in on the negative and depressed side of my life. \n",

      "Title: I [18] am thinking about breaking up with my partner [19] of 2.5 years\n",
      "Body text: (WARNING! LONG POST!)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I've been in a relationship with my partner for 2.5 years now, and I just don't feel as interested anymore. They haven't done anything crazy that makes me want to break up immediately, but just a lot of little things have added up. A lot of their habits that used to be cute just annoy me now. They are very bad at saving money, and even when we talk about this they just avoid the topic and continue buying useless stuff, I also pay for meals and some fun activities pretty regularly too, I'm also the only one with a car so significant driving and gas money that I have to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning of our relationship they would get so angry so fast, never to me but always to their mom and sister, and they would yell at them while we were on FaceTime and then cry to me about it and rant constantly. They have gotten much better now (I think because of me) and don't argue too much but it was a little scary just how angry they got and they would punch stuff and hurt themselves as well, but now they hardly ever do that so maybe I shouldn't even worry about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, I will admit I have been more distant but I've just been thinking about maybe ending it for awhile, and they have noticed this I think and they overthink almost constantly. If I don't respond quickly (a few hours) they are overthinking and triple text a lot and usually say \"I'm sorry\" after texting a lot and that makes me feel so guilty, but also I want to be able to do my own stuff sometimes and not talk with anyone for a bit and I'm very introverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever we hangout if I'm not constantly attached to them and cuddling or holding their hand or something they'll start squeezing their hand until their nails leave a mark and then (maybe I'm looking into this too much) they try and keep their hand in my view so I see them squeezing and hurting themselves and then make me feel bad about it. And sometimes I just pretend not to see because it can be so annoying to see, as they don't do anything to work on themselves and they need constant reassurance about everything and it can be so draining. I have talked with them about how I'm not a super clingy person and sometimes I just don't wanna cuddle and hold hands all day and they said they understand, but then their actions don't line up with what they say and they're always clingy. They often then text after hanging out and say \"sorry was I too clingy please don't hate me and leave me\" and sometimes I just ignore those texts for a bit  because I have already explained I don't like being clingy and they respect it in the moment but never stay true to their word.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can't keep a job very long and always somehow finds a problem with the work place and it's always the companies fault. And maybe they've just had bad luck in jobs but I think they are definitely the problem in some scenarios but just blame the workplace instead. Also they quit their job before finding a replacement job. Then they complain that they don't have money and can't help their mom pay for rent and freak out about finding a place to live (completely understandable), but they also don't save and don't keep a job and find a job that they have a reliable ride to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I feel like sometimes maybe they shouldn't lay so much of their problems and trauma onto me. As I'm younger than the, I don't have the answers and I don't have the money to help them out. I e told them to try and maybe talk with someone, or some form of therapy and there's options to get it for cheap and easy but they just keep refusing saying they'd rather talk with me about it but it's just so burdensome on me and I know that probably makes me seem selfish but I just don't know what do ad they look at me for a lot of answers and when I do give some they don't even follow the solutions I give so honestly what's the point?\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I think I do want to break up but I'm afraid of the consequences. For one, I have like three friends I hangout with outside of school or work and they are one of them and all of us hangout together since we are all friends with each other, so breaking up would hurt that friend group, but my partner is in a bad living situation and sometimes sleeps over at our friends house so I wouldn't want to make our friends \"choose a side\" and if they were going to I'd want them to be friends with my partner so they get rides to work and have a place to sleep, but I also really don't want to lose these friendships because I love them all dearly (as friends of course). \n",
      "\n",
      "Another consequence is that I'm worried I might regret it and feel a sense of loss, because even though I have other friends I really only text my partner daily and I think I would feel a sense of loss from losing someone to talk to everyday (even if I feel like sometimes the conversations are completely pointless) but if we breakup and then later I think it's a mistake that would suck a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason is because I'm afraid of how they'll react, if they've already freaked out so much of the thought or nightmares of me leaving then I can't imagine just how much it'll hurt them and what they'd do, like maybe they'll blame themselves, hurt themselves or something else. I don't want to hurt them but I also don't want to be in a relationship with them. I do still love them as a friend but not as a partner, I'm not sure how I should go about this any advice would be incredibly helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I've been thinking about this for probably a month and a half now and I haven't talked with anyone but I've don't quizzes a talked with Chatgpt about it lol, but in a more serious note I'm really going back and forth about what I should do. Also their birthday is the end of this month and I'm not sure if maybe I should wait until after their birthday so I don't hurt them before then, or if really there's always going to be more events that would delay it and I should just get it over with. I'm really not sure what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also since their birthday is in a few weeks and all our friends are planning a trip in August, if we do break up in worried how it'll affect those events and plans\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I think I fell out of love with my partner and I'm unsure of what I should do, break up or not? It might ruin a lot in my life but it might also be good for us in the long run. Should we break up, or stay together? If we should break up, when should I?\n",

      "Title: My (28F) boyfriend (30M) lied to me about the context and timelines of last flings, but there’s no sign of him actually cheating. How do I move forward?\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "My boyfriend of 8 months appears to have had a few “lingerers” I should say that he was still in contact with after we started dating. Some of this feels like micro-cheating to me and I can’t get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girl 1 was someone he was hooking up with a few months before we were dating. She ghosted him apparently but popped back up a few weeks before we started talking. He initially told me that he was the one who set the boundary that he wanted to keep things platonic, but after seeing the messages I saw it was actually her that said that. Fine, no big deal since we weren’t even talking much less dating at that point, but why lie? But what else I discovered in the messages after I asked to look at them is that they had been making plans to hang AFTER him and I started dating. They weren’t in any sort of regular contact, and it appeared that the main thing was to get his hoodie that he left at her house back and they were just going to hang a bit since they had to meet up anyway. My issue is, he never told me about it. Actually, he initially told me that he hadn’t heard from her at all. Another lie, why? When we started arguing about it and why he lied, he said he wanted to just “cleanly wrap up loose ends” since our relationship moved kind of fast and he never had the chance to get his stuff back or have a conversation with her about why they can’t be friends. Hm. Interesting, but still confused on why he had to lie. They ended up never meeting up because he never responded to her message the first time she asked (while we were dating, maybe a good sign?), and when she came back to ask again he said he wouldn’t flake this time but then SHE ended up being the one to flake. I asked why he lied about never hearing from her, and if he would have told me they weren’t going to hang, and he said he lied because he didn’t want me to worry about her at all and that yes, he would have said something… but I guess I will never know since they never actually hung out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girl 2, similar situation but they never hooked up, just some flirtation and heavy sexual texts between them. He actually told me about her (not about the flirting part, just that they were friends!) so I didn’t think much at first, until a few months later I saw their text thread. To be fair, the heavy flirting had stopped before we started dating, and he actually talked about me to her (possibly another good sign?) but then I also saw plans for them to hang out at some point which he never told me about. The plans ended up falling through because he had a family emergency, and when I asked him why he never told me about their flirting past he said again, he planned on limiting contact with her and didn’t want me to worry because he had no intentions of ever doing anything with her again. They were simply sports buddies and from my knowledge, only hung out to play tennis (texts back this up too to be fair.) This was also another incident where he needed something back because I guess she still had a set of his keys that fell out of his pocket when he was in her car when they went to grab food after tennis one day, so he said most of his motivation was to get his keys back but also hang out because she invited him to an activity he likes to do (golfing). I asked again if he planed on telling me about their hang out, and he said yes, but again, I would never know if that’s true because the hang out never ended up happening!\n",
      "\n",
      "Girl 3 is a part of his training cohort that he used to talk to/flirt with heavily (no hooking up afaik) that came to town for a training and I guess they got lunch together (he says they just happened to end up at the same spot because it is right next to where they were at for training). They hadn’t been flirting recently, for over a year as far as I know, but had still been doing virtual pilates sessions together since they had a working relationship and they both needed teaching hours for their certification. She seemed like she was expecting more from him and he wasn’t giving it to her, to be fair, and she is the main one that has (and continues to) reach out, and he says he has to maintain a functional working relationship with her since they are in the same cohort but he is maintaining his boundaries. From what I have seen this is true, but I feel like this added fuel to the fire of just knowing he seemed to (at the time) still be in contact with so many women from his past. She stills him every couple weeks, from what I assume is just pilates stuff, but every time I see her name pop up I get triggered because of his past lies, and feeling like something could be going on under my nose without me knowing. With this, I was mainly upset because he never told me about her at all, that she was in town for training, or that they had to hang out (the lunch and also I guess the entire cohort went out for drinks that same night. He did call me a couple times that day as usual, so I guess a good sign?) But also, he once again lied to me when I asked if they had a past and he said no, until I scrolled to the messages where she literally was sending him suggestive videos a year or two back and he said “that was so long ago that he forgot”\n",
      "\n",
      "He also lied to me about hooking up with someone the month before we started talking. I acknowledge this was before me, but my question still is why lie? He says it’s because he knows about my past being cheated on and didn’t want to feed any of my insecurities, and he knew he was kind of on a wild bender right before we started dating and he never expected to end up in a relationship. I also sense he has a bit of shame about his sexual past and being involved with so many women, and I think he cares that I view him in a positive light. We all have pasts and I too have had my benders and times when I was promiscuous, so I wouldn’t have judged him. I guess I understand why he lied, although it feels extremely misguided and immature to lie if you have nothing to hide. My feeling is unless there was something to hide, he would not have lied to me. He’s expressed remorse for these things, and as far as I know since we talked about it a few months ago has not been in contact with any of these women, other than the pilates girl because he apparently “has” to be in some contexts. But it fractured my trust very deeply and I didn’t discover some of these lies until recently, he lied until I had to bring up the text thread and show him what I saw, and he continued his stance that he lied about these things to protect me from feeling insecure. Although there has been absolutely no evidence of him actually cheating, the fact that he lied in the first place makes me weary. I’m not sure how to move forward from this, and it’s affecting our relationship because I’m still extremely hurt and it’s coming out in toxic ways that are making things worse between us. \n",

      "TL;DR: Boyfriend lied to me about the context and timelines of his past flings that he was still in contact with.

It feels like micro-cheating to me and I can’t get over it \n",

      "Body text: So, I’ve been seeing this girl for a couple of months now, and her jealousy is becoming a bit much for me. I could do something as little as mention a girl (a 60 y/o co-worker was the most recent) and she would completely shut down and get all pouty. It would be fine if she didn’t mean it or loved on me after words with a “haha I’m just kidding” but she gets genuinely upset over something like that. Then she makes some kind of over exaggerated comment like “oh, then I just won’t come over anymore” or “that’s fine, we don’t need to have intercourse anymore.”She accused me of cheating or doing shady stuff when I’ve never given any indication of wanting someone else. When I’m on my phone and she’s near, I always get hit with the “ah, texting your hoes again.” She’s had guy friends in the past that she’s been involved with physically and I didn’t make a huge fuss about it, even when they hung out I tried to hide my concern. Not to mention I spend nearly every day with her, if not then just talking to her. I’m just afraid she’s going to break up with me and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells constantly. Do I stay in this relationship? I’ve expressed my displeasure and talked to her about it but it’s like talking to a brick wall but I love her and want to think she’s open minded and trusts me. \n",

      "To summarize my current situation I have been dating this amazing girl for 7 months now. I have always had trust issues due to past experiences and seeing friends cheated on ect. My current girlfriend hasnt given me any indication she will cheat and I haven't acted in anyway that is controlling or said anything other than the joking \"better not cheat on me comment\" when we first officially started dating.\n",

      "She has really bad daddy issues and mental issues stemming from her past so my insecurity is the last thing I want to bother her with. However we are going to be apart for 3 months (We have been together everyday since we started dating pretty much).  \n",

      "Title: Should I keep pursuing if it may become a LDR?\n",
      "Body text: So I’ve (25m) been seeing for a bit over a month, this wonderful woman (19f), we met accidentally and I had no intention of dating her and she wasn’t looking for a relationship at the moment but she was persistent to know me and I felt I just needed to get to know her, we have had three dates so far with more planned, we’ve connected so well and are aligned in so many ways. It was pleasantly unexpected and it’s kind of drawn us closer because of how comfortably and openly we can talk with one another and how much in common we have. \n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently she dropped some news on me, she only found out soon before our recent date that she will be moving back to Canada, and where she will be is about a 9 hour flight/37hr drive from me, she didn’t want to get into a serious relationship before meeting me because she wasn’t sure if she would have to move back home or not, she won’t be leaving to go back home for three months but she will be back in a year. There is a chance she may not have to move back home but it’s looking that way now and I told her to continue with her plans and to not change them for me, especially since what we have is so new. \n",
      "\n",
      "It took me a minute to figure out how I felt. She wants to continue to keep seeing me but doesn’t want me to feel like I’m obligated to keep seeing her or that I have to enter a long distance relationship with her. I told her I would normally end things with this knowledge with most women but the way her and I have connected I feel as if I at least need to keep dating her until the time comes for her to leave and then “see where we’re at then”. She agreed entirely and she is happy that I’m willing to keep trying with her for now. If things go well and we’re doing great in 3 months then, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I’d be willing to enter a LDR with her. She said if things work out she would be happy to do that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also knew that if I ended things now, and knowing she would be within driving distance for three more months, it would drive me nuts and I’d hate myself for not at least seeing what there is, especially since things have been so great when it was from a very unexpected place, doesn’t feel accidental (even though it could still be, time will tell) \n",
      "\n",
      "There would be a couple times during that year she will be back here to visit, and I will have a few different weeks I can likely visit up there so if we get to that point and decide to enter a LDR then we wouldn’t be totally separated the whole time. \n",

      "Body text: I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 6 years. We've had our ups and downs throughout the years, but generally I am really happy! He's funny, caring, smart, and really loves me. I know he sees a future with me and we've talked about it. When we talk about specific things that we want in life, it makes my heart warm to think about it. We laugh a lot and spend a lot of time together.\n",

      "Of course, not everything is perfect. There are some things that I wish were different - for example, I feel like our arguments will often spiral and ends with me crying 50% of the time (but I also cry really easily).

      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year. We had great conversations  when we first met and led to dating eventually and we love each other a lot. I am technically his first love and I never met anyone as sweet as him ever in my life who also has the same mindset for relationships as me. However we are both students and the semester is ending so we are very busy. I don't know why but lately I've been feeling off. I didn't lose any feelings for him but once I talked about how lonely I've been feeling lately and getting upset over minor things thinking he lost feelings so i was being dry on purpose to see if he would notice but I could tell that he was still trying to talk to me so I told him my feelings and why i was being dry and it made him frustrated and told me that he's really stressed because of his workload and busy schedule. He seemed pretty mad so I immediately apologized for being immature and got mad that I wasn't communicating when I think communication is important myself. My friend thought it was a red flag that he got so mad but he apologized to me later and tried to understand me and told me he'll do better. Now that was a month ago and it was good afterwards but idk why i still feel off. he texts me often still but sometimes when he doesnt text me when he's home or when he's back which seems off. But I really try my best to understand because he's busy and I never complained to him about his busy schedule btw because its general manners to understand that. I just feel frustrated when he's been home for like 2 hours but doesn't text me at all which happens like once in a while. I am a huge overthinker as well so I worry that he lost feelings or smt. I think we r probably js comfortable with each other now and maybe we js think abt this diff? idk i thought about how it would be if i ended it and i literally can never do that since the thought of it js led to tears immediately and i love him so much.\n",

      "We first did long distance for the first year and we had a few challenges come up a lot revolving around time for each other with the long distance and I struggled with boundaries with her and feeling insecure as she has historically hooked up with virtually all of her friends and was personally still hanging out with people she had little emotional flings things with (including very recent to our start of relationship). I did struggle with this a lot first and we had to communicate boundaries and I was definitely insecure and bless her she also wasn't the best at making me feel very secure i.e telling one of them that I was insecure about her friendship with him etc. I have since moved past that and we established boundaries and I also personally had to grow up a bit too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a bit of kerfuffle at the end of last year and she had to go on anti-depreesants and she was taking a lot of things out on me that were triggers from her past relationship, I won't lie there was a part of me that still held a bit of anger for that but we had a really lengthy conversation the other day and went to our first couples counselling session and it went really well and I recognised I need to be more honest. With her anxiety it has recently gotten quite control and it every day she is anxious about something and I am bit exhausted, she never checks in with me about if im able to take it on and like sometimes I have had a long day to. I feel drained but I love her.\n",

      "I moved back from a samll regional towns where I have been living for the last two years on my own and made a really solid group of her friends. When I moved back to our hometown I have really struggled with the social aspect and my one main friend is someone who I have grown up with (our mums where in mothers group together when pregnant, we have gone on multiple family holidays together including international, and my friend worked as carer and lived at my house for upwards of three years looking after my sister who has ASD and I lived aways o she is very integrated in my family and I am with hers. We are essentially sisters and our parents have always called us that and refer to us as second daughter. This is where the issue comes in, now my friend and I don't have sleepovers (something I don't engage with, hard with women women relationships) she is having some home issues so my mum has offered her a room at our house during the week when she is not house sitting but she is often at work etc. For context, when I moved back I am back with my parents and she is also living at home (cost fo living crises) my family works away so during the week tuesday to friday we usually stay there as its just us. This is my first proper relationship so I am navigating the challenges as they come.\n",

      "My friend and I sometimes meal prep together ( we will bulk make 30 burritos and split it becasue we are both watching our calories and macros and its something she enjoys, my partner hates cooking) my partner goes out quite regularly with her friends etc and she has some core groups from high school - my childhood friend is the only one who lives in with ten minutes (everyone else is 40+) and I only hang out with her when my partner is out with her friends i don't usually see her unless my partner is out as I priotise tiime with my partner. If I am honest, I left a lot of my friends in my old town as well as my independence so I could be with my partner. I have struggled on the aspect and I feel like my partner doesn't always understand how hard it is moving towns at 24 and not having your high school friends and I haven't had a lot of time to process this because of helping her with her anxiety, which I should have been more firm on my boundaries.\n",

I did and we had a great time, my friend and i planned to go again to the drive in and when i told my partner she got very upset and basically demanded that i never go with anyone but her and she got super upset about it and said that i essentially have to make sacrifices and grow up. I said no, that place is special and she is the main reason she didn;t like this and got very upset with me. I requested some space and we agreed and then when we were supposed to talk last night, she was saying she was super stressed from eveyrhting and she was having some time with her mum. I was like cool, no worries come over whenever. Soemthing happened with my sister telling lies about me to my mum, so i went home earlier then planned (I was at adinner with my aunty) and my friend was coming over to pick something up anyway so ia sked if she could help (as she has experience with my sister) and i just let my my partner know as i have this constant feeling that i have to tell her when i talk to my friend or see her. This started another episode of my partner saying I broke her heart etc.\n",

For example one of the people she had an emotional fling with I said I wasn't comfortable with her driving with him late at night and going into his room etc but other then that go for it. She has also made comments that my friend does 'girlfriend duties' one of these examples included my graduation, the day of she had work to do and was doing stuff, I had to pick up my gown and explain my situtation etc and my partner didnt offer to take me or say anything just seemed very flat and monotone, my friend was coming to my graduation etc and I was telling her about how stressed I was about this and she offered to take me and that made my girlfriend upset. My partner later acknowledged that she was upet about not thinking to offer and she can get upset becasue she doen't feel thoughtful but I am not quite sure how to help her. I would really appreciate some advice on how to best explain my feelings to her whilst being kind and gentle as her initial feelings are always very intense.

      "Title: How to manage an anxious attachment style in a healthy relationship? (F19)\n",
      "Body text: I (F19) am in my first healthy relationship. My boyfriend (M18) is nothing but kind and loving, and I’m so grateful to have been able to meet him. We’ve been dating for about 6 months now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background to my attachment style: I believe this is rooted in my relationship with my mom. One thing about her is that she’s an alcoholic, and has been my entire life. She becomes very vulgar and straight up mean. She raised me as a single mom until I was about 7, but my entire childhood, she would leave me to “go find me a dad” or because she wanted to get drunk. Even after my step dad came into my life, her addiction never got better and she’s broken countless promises. I’ve learned to not trust her, sober or drunk. My childhood has caused me to become good at recognizing patterns, being self aware, and being perceptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I’ve always known that I had an anxious attachment style, but it never caused issues in my past relationships (maybe because I knew I didn’t see a future with them). The only issue it caused was I could never leave when I knew I should, because I was so attached to them. Now, my attachment style is causing me different issues. We’ve only been together for about 6 months, and I know we’re both very young, but I know I want a future with him. We’ve talked about it and we both agree that we’ll get married one day if things go the way they’ve been going. There’s literally nothing wrong with our relationship, but I’m always so worried about me not being good enough for him, how he might leave me one day, etc. Logically, I know there’s a possibility of us staying together, and there’s also a possibility of us breaking up in the future. The possibility of us breaking up breaks me every time I think about it. I’ve found myself asking for reassurance WAY too much. I have a habit of asking “do you still love me?” or “do you hate me?”, even though I know he loves me, which I recognize is unhealthy. My boyfriend has a very secure attachment style, and says he likes to live in the moment and not worry about what could happen later on. He wants to enjoy the good we have now, and that’ll help us to keep being good to each other in the future. I know he’s right, but all I can do is worry about the future. What if there’s an issue that will inevitably break us in the future? What if resentment starts to build? Recently we had a small issue about how often we see each other (I made it into an issue). There was a day we were both off work, and I wanted to see him, but he wanted a day to himself. Later, we ended up Facetiming but all I could think about was how I’d rather this conversation be in person, and I couldn’t understand why he didn’t want to see me. Again, logically I KNOW that this is healthy and there’s nothing wrong with us not seeing each other on our day off, but my anxiety just won’t stop and I don’t know what to do. The biggest issue I have is handling my emotions when we leave each other. Every time he or I have to leave, I get SO sad and hopeless. There’s even been a time that I had an anxiety attack because I had to go home and I didn’t want to leave him. There’s been lots of other times where I’ve been so sad that I end up crying and sometimes sobbing because he’s leaving. He handles me really well despite all of this. He’s very patient with me and has made it a point to let me know when he’s going to leave so I can prepare, and it’s helped a bit. I’m just tired of putting this burden on him. It really frustrates me that my childhood is causing me emotional issues I thought I already worked through. I want to be better for him and myself and learn to have a secure attachment style. I’ve never been the one to cause problems in the relationship, and I would really appreciate if y’all could give me advice, especially if you have a similar upbringing. It’d be very helpful if you could list what steps you took to be better, how to handle overwhelming emotions when there’s logically nothing wrong, etc. Thank you for reading!\n",

      "TLDR: I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in, and my anxious attachment style is causing me issues. He has a secure attachment style, and has done nothing but love and support me. I’ve had breakdowns and anxiety attacks over small, normal things like leaving each other for a couple of days to a week. I’d appreciate advice on how to manage this.\n",

      "Title: I (f26) need advice on my relationship with my stepmom (f55)\n",
      "Body text: \n",
      "I'm (F26) an only child. My parents divorced when I was a baby, and my dad married my stepmom (F55) when I was 14. She has two kids from a previous marriage, both younger than me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My stepmom and I have never had a close relationship. She's anxious, controlling, and often micromanages everyone. I've always tried to be polite and avoid conflict for my dad's sake, but over the years, several situations have hurt me.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Christmas, my dad gave her a pricey gift \"from all the kids.\" A few days later, she texted me upset for not getting her a gift, despite the group gift I was told I was apart of. Every year since then, I make sure to get her something individually to avoid that happening again. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was 16, she tried to buy her dad's old convertible as my first car. I’m 5’0” and couldn’t see over the dash. She suggested a booster seat, which was a humiliating and rediculous suggestion. When I politely declined the car due to this, she called me ungrateful, then lied and said she’d already bought it and stormed off. My dad said nothing like usual. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently, I found a Facebook post of my stepmom, dad, and stepsiblings at my stepsister’s graduation, an event I wasn’t invited to nor told about. The caption read, “My beautiful daughter graduated today! [My name] couldn’t make it.” I had no idea it was even happening. When I texted the family chat to congratulate my stepsister, my stepmom replied, “I didn’t know you were on Facebook.” She unfriended me that same day. I think she was embarrassed I caught her lying. Again, no apology, and my dad didn’t say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many more instances like these. I feel like I’m always blamed or excluded, and my dad never stands up for me. He's also a people pleaser, and I think he avoids conflict with her, often at my expense. It’s difficult for me to just walk away because there are times where she’s very nice and supportive. \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I move forward in this relationship? I understand I should have said something to my dad years ago, but I was young at the time and thought I was doing the right thing by taking the high road. Now I feel like I’ve made a mistake and did myself a disservice in the long run. My husband says if it was his family, he would not even bother with them anymore, but he’s much better at not caring what others think about him than I am. Any advice is appreciated!\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; Do not like the way my stepmom has treated me over the years. How do I move forward in this relationship?\n",

      "Body text: I, 27F and 27M have been in a relationship for 8 years now. I love him to bits but I can't help feeling like our relationship is unfulfilled. For context we are in a LDR, and no the kind it's affordable to fly over every month. We have one child who lives with me, and he's a good father to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our relationship hasn't changed much but I feel like it's getting annoying to talk to him or reply him. It all stemmed from a couple of months ago when we visited him I found he had been meeting an ex of his. The messages were pg nothing alarming minus the fact that he met with her without telling me. Literally pictures he sent me were taken by her. It hurt me deeply. I also found him asking \"massage workers\" (for lack of a better term) their prices but he never booked appointments or continued the conversation after getting the prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I confronted him about the girl he didn't realise what I was asking him until I asked are you cheating, when he apologised and told me there was nothing going on. And the massage workers he just messaged but didn't act on it. I chose to forgive him but now there's a rift. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've come to realise he plans for him and not us. We are meant to have a trip in a couple of months, but I seem to be the only one planning, Yes we are going 50/50 but to get him to help me pick accommodation was a chore, he didn't even help in the end. I keep asking him what he wants to do on the trip but he just says \"anything\". But suddenly his friends want to go on a trip with him he's Mr Planner. In fact he's the one that make plans happen when it comes to his friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters worse I will Literally tell him something and he'll forget. He blames his memory but I have expressed that it makes me feel unheard no matter how small it is. He hasn't changed and its reached the point where I just don't want to tell him things. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR I'm trying to find our LDR spark again but he doesn't seem to put the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now the question is, why is the relationship feeling unfulfilled, Do we need to work on the spark? Or is this just a rough season?\n",

      "Hello,\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m 33 and my wife is 32. We have a 3.5 year old daughter and usually live a very healthy lifestyle. There are absolutely no issues between me and my wife other than her mom and her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been married for 8 years now (2018). I moved to another state to be with her and marry her, I have no family here. I was always hoping that a marriage meant two people and their kids (if they have). I never knew that her mom and bother (30 now)  would be so involved in everything that it would cause problems between me and my wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the stage -\n",
      "We dated for a few years before we got married. We broke up for about a year and later connected again and I said if we want to do this right it won’t be long distance so I moved to her state. She is close to her parents. I always respected them and was in a good relationship with them also. Her dad was someone who would always make sure everyone is level headed and everyone is happy. I always used to go to their house, hang out and have a good time. I was really close with her brother also. We were good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward. We got married, everything was fine. I bought another house (condition of the marriage set by her parents). I had no problem buying the house because it was going to be where my wife and I lived anyway. We bought the house close to her parents, about 20 mins so we could  be close to them.  Later on, I realized that there was no alone time I was spending with my wife, they were always around and we hung out every weekend. I used to complain about this but it was nothing to the point where we fought bad. Her brother used to come stay with us for weeks at a time. Again, was not an issue but I kept realizing that I don’t have any alone time to build a marriage with my wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years go by - no big fights, but we were doing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father passes away with a heart attack. We paid for the funeral because at that time, I am not sure if her mom was in a state to handle anything. I never expected her to not pay us back or even after a couple of months thing she would bring it up. To this day, her mother has not opened her wallet even one time. Her mother doesn’t drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her son left the family and decided to go to to another state and party (he claims this was his way of dealing with it) he did not have a job at this point. He did not help with the funeral, he did not help pay for anything. He maybe was 25 at this point. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had to step up to help her mother-\n",
      "1) I helped take her to her job (not all the time, my wife and I split this duty)\n",
      "2) her mom made my wife to help pay for everything. We had to pay their bills, their expensive car (which they could have sold and made money on - but said was a sentimental thing bc of their dad). We paid for her fence, her groceries, taking her to work and back, the damn car, and everything) she had a job and had money at this point. She also got money from her husbands company when he died. She just guilt tripped my wife into doing this. This is where I started to disagree.\n",
      "3) the bother was having a hard time getting a job, he would bum off us in my house, live there practically for months. I even helped him get a job in a great company so he could stand on his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time one of our family friends slipped up and said that her mom was talking crap behind  my back saying I was manipulating my wife (her daughter) to take her away from her. I never manipulated anything, my only thing was she is taking our money for no reason, she was playing my wife and she was playing the victim game and using her. This time my wife racked up about 60k in debt; which I paid back when I sold my house. We bought another one after (even closer to her mom cause she was alone) the son never helped with anything other than throw money at her when needed and went along with his friends and partying. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the disagreements started with my wife - I kept saying we should not be paying for them all the time; they have money, they can support themselves but this went on and on and on. They use my wife and know she will pay. So they kept doing it. My wife and I had bad fights over this. \n",
      "\n",
      "A could have years go by, my wife was doing her masters and she got pregnant (by me) we were so happy. We told her mom and she said why did you get pregnant you are in school? My wife and I both have good jobs; nothing was an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the pregnancy, it was tail end of Covid so things were getting back to normal, her mom and bother never helped with anything it was just my wife and I. Which is completely fine with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After having my baby and having a full time job I got busy, my focus was my a daughter and my wife. I didn’t have much time to hang out with her brother so we got distant. He later got married and moved to another city 4 hours away. We knew this might happen so we made the decision to buy house closer to her mom. Her mom would uber or we would pick and drop her off so she could spend time with her grand daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh during the marriage her mom asked my wife to pay for the renovations in their house!! I said no. My wife and I had just bought another house closer to her mom, my expenses more than doubled. Things were tight but I needy expenses to settle in with new house and my daughter school, etc. her mom told\n",
      "Her that her house would eventually go to my daughter anyway after she dies so we should pay for it. I was furious. If you don’t have money - ask. Don’t blackmail us into paying for it. I rejected this and my wife and I fought really bad and we ended up paying. I am still paying credit cards for this.\n",
      "It was 8k. Plus we had to give money for the wedding gift also. Quite a bit. It was not easy. \n",
      "\n",
      "During this time- her brother has a habit of leeching  off people who benefit him; he’s done this with multiple of his friends. I see this, this has happened with me too. Fast forward -\n",
      "\n",
      "His fiend was looking for some money to accelerate a business deal, it was mutual for me as well to lend the money because he would give me a return. This was no issue and this deal went fine. But, he was my bother in laws friend - I confirmed if it was ok with him, he said yes. I had to ask because I didn’t know how the process worked. If my bother in law would have said no to give his friend money, there is no way I would have. This was 4 months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s  it like his friend was not my fiend also, we hung out with him and his parents a few times without my brother in law being there. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We later hung out a few times (all together) and talked about investing together in something - we all said we would. Time went by, and i used to hang with his friend on and off, we were mutual. No issues here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later - I saw him and the bother post something on social media, so I simply asked his friend, are we still doing this investment together. If not, the stock market was low and I was going to put some money in there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The brother calls my wife (his sister) and goes off about how I went behind his back and asked his friend about this business deal and not him. Keep in mind he lives 4 hours away; we don’t talk on a daily basis. I never saw this as an issue but a simple question; I had no intention of him not telling my brother in law I asked, I knew it would happen, but I never saw an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my wife calls me and tells me all this happened and to clear the air. So I called her bother and explained the story - he denies saying it’s ok for me to lend his friend money. He says he told me to keep the money for another investment that my brother in law wanted to do. But I had money for both, I never said no to this new opportunity also. He also embed that we need him and his friend to make money. My wife and I have good jobs and never needed this. Nor do we need now. It was just a friendly mutual thing so I never thought any bad of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I said if you have events in your head that played out your way and I have it\n",
      "My way (which in this case my wife was also aware of his approval etc) I said there is nothing I can do. I told him there is no way I would have lent money to his friend without his approval and I specifically brought out the fact that I asked about the process of how it works.\n",
      " \n",
      "My wife keeps arguing with him, and keeps bringing me into the middle of it. I has a conversation to clear the air, he doesn’t see it my way. I said ok, fine. Let’s just move out about our lives. We shouldn’t  do businesses deals with family.  Ok cool, let’s move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I unfollowed them on social media because I don’t want to see what they are doing for my own peace. I wish nothing bad for them, you do you I’ll do me, simple. My wife also left a group on another app where the families were bc she also has some\n",
      "Issues with others in that chat and asked me to leave as well, I didn’t care so I left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mom the texts her saying that she is being hasty, and I  am scheming to break up their family. They wanted me to follow him on Instagram for\n",
      "“Optics” that it looks bad. It’s messing with my peace. Her mother also said I am the reason that she her family has broke  up. My wife still insists that I talk to them and sort this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thinking -\n",
      "I did everything for them, paid for them, paid for their father’s funeral, paid for her food, her house repairs and the full on renovation for her sons wedding and she went behind my back and told\n",
      "Others that I am trying to manipulate her daughter for saying take a step back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her son, I let him crash in my house\n",
      "On and off for years. I got him his job, helped him and her mom with whatever they wanted. Helped sell their truck, and even to this day I helped with their broken AC, fix their fence, anything. Just not\n",

      "\n",
      "Her mom just plays the sad victim game to get attention and get what she wants from her daughter which does affect us.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife- she kept giving into them till I put my foot down. She has these moments where she has issues with her family and me and her do well because she stays away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her family comes crying to her, make her feed bad and she gets closer to them again and the cycle repeats of us having uses again. My wife says she just wants everyone to be happy and keep the family together. I have no problem but I am like just leave me alone; you do you with your family; my daughter is even allowed to hang out with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife took my daughter to be with her daily during Easter, it was important to me that we spend Easter together as a family. I communicated that with her clearly and she knew. She still made this decision. I also see that my wife allows them to take advantage of her and she allows them to put her down and she keeps going back to that zone over and over again and my marriage is being dragged with it.\n",

      "Body text: Hello everyone, This is my first Reddit post and to be frank not one I am proud of. I have a boyfriend of 5 years that I have been dating since we were 20. We sort of dated after only a month of knowing each other and I felt off about it since I usually like to have known the person before I officially date. He’s a great guy, he’s tall, handsome, sweet and caring. My younger sisters love him and look up to him, he met my dad before he passed sway a few years back, but… \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s been instances that I have turned a blind eye to. So dire that his mother and dad said I deserved better. The reality is he’s quite insecure and a very negative person. All of my friends that I have had, he always had something awful to say about them. Whether it was the way they looked or how they acted, he’s never been nice when talking about them or others. He has had a number of health problems that we try to navigate through but sometime he lashes out his frustration on me. When he gets really mad he’ll slam doors or punch walls loudly. It scares our 8 years old dog. Sometime he’ll say he’d rather just k*** himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "He’s easily provoked and when he jabs at me with his words and I say something back it becomes a huge fight. I’ve always helped out my family since my dads no longer in the picture and it may frustrate me financially but I do it because I can and I love them. However, his response is that the moment we move out together “you can’t be helping your family anymore, forget about them” I also just started going to yoga classes, he says it’s a waste of money and that I’m not doing anything. I run daily errands and he complains that I never spend enough time with him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t picture him in my future anymore, I love him but emotionally I cannot depend on him. We’ve talked about it before but he always says I’m the one at fault. If I cry he wants me to “get over it.” So I’ve been keeping things to myself now. I’m not sure, am I exaggerating? Should we take a break so we can both reset? I feel confined, like I’m walking on eggshells. I don’t see my friends anymore, I’m always questioned about what I do. We’ve talked but it’s been five years and it’s still the same. I don’t know what to do, I’m just ready to leave.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve dated a person who was severely depressed before, many years ago, and it unfortunately did not go so well because the situation turned abusive so I might be carrying that baggage into my current situation. But I wanted to see an outside perspective either way. \n",

We’ve also definitely gotten closer recently and started opening up. \n",

      "For me, that’s meant talking about my family and other stuff like that. For her, she recently (within the past couple weeks) has started to reveal to me that she is pretty severely depressed and talks down to herself constantly (for example, she said she’s constantly thinking to herself about how she’s a lazy piece of shit and worthless). She also told me that as a result of that and stress at work, she often fantasizes about offing herself, even though she says she’d never actually do it, because the idea of it offers her a lot of relief. \n",

I really really like our dates and most of what we do when we hang out together, and I think she’s great, and most of the time this doesn’t come up, but I’m starting to feel like she might not be in a place I feel comfortable with if our relationship were to progress into something more long term. But I also empathize with her deeply, with her pain, and I don’t want to make her feel worse. Also for context, I’m thinking about this because it’s become clear to me that her feelings for me are getting more serious and I want to figure out how I feel about this sooner rather than later since I know I’m also feeling more attached with time. \n",

      "Body text: Tl;dr \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been dating for about four months. I'm 32 and my boyfriend's 30. Our sex life was really good at the beginning. It seemed like our sex drives were compatible. I have a high sex drive and I thought he did as well. Things were really, really good. I found the more time we've spent together, like we've been spending every day together for the last, I guess, month and a half, two months. Since we've been spending more time together, I've been finding that the sex has been getting weaker and weaker. I found blue pills, I guess it's like a generic form of Viagra, and I talked to him about it. He said that because he has anxiety, he's very tired and stressed out and whatnot, that he will take a quarter of that if he needs to. He hasn't really been taking it lately, and it shows, because he can't get an erection, it seems, without some sort of support. I will make out and it will stay soft. I'll touch him down there, it stays soft. He said I give him the best blowjob that he's ever had, but he couldn't get hard so that I could even go down on him. He had to pull out his phone and look at porn for a minute to be able to get erect enough for me to actually do anything. I felt really upset. I feel insecure. I feel like I don't turn him on anymore. I feel like, why do you need this pill. Why do you need porn? Why is it so hard for you at 30 years old. I'm starting to feel rejected. He had a prescription that dated a couple days before we met. How long has he needed this, and is he lying about not having ED. Because it seems like he really needs the pill, or he really, really needs something. I don't really know what to do at this point, because it's just causing a lot of stress for me. What should I do ?\n",

We have already been struggling with trust. He says one thing and doesn’t do it. I love him but it really hurt that he viewed me as toxic or abusive. I know he was angry and he said he didn’t mean it but it still hurts. It makes me feel like I’m not enough for him or that I’m too much. Idk what to do. I told him he hurt me and he said he didn’t know how to take back what he said. I don’t want him to take it back I just want to know that he genuinely doesn’t think that. What do I do?

      "Body text: **TL;DR;**: I think I have feelings for my friend of 6 years. Is it even worth saying anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "I (24F) have been growing feelings for my closest friend (25M). We’ve been friends all of college and now post grad, so like 6 years. We were in the same friend circle, but grew closer and started hanging out more after graduating uni and staying in the same city for work. We work well together especially within our current friend group (we plan/coordinate mostly everything for them) and even hanging out just us (like dinners/activities). We have a good time since we have similar interests and humor. Even some of my girl friends joke about us ending up together. Recently, my mom has been bringing this up too. I have gone back and forth with feelings for him and we have a platonic boundary. There’s prob only one time a couple months ago where I feel like maybe the boundary felt blurry. But mostly, nothing has ever been addressed and we’ve dated other people here-and-there short term. My prev boyfriend felt insecure around him and his prev girl was concerned/insecure about me. I realized I care a lot about him and recently feeling kinda irritable when he mentions the current girl he met from an app. This past weekend, it surprised me that he mentioned her and I started to tear up, so I blew it off bc it had been a long day. Honestly, in general, I think I’m really good at keeping my composure (in most situations) and people can’t really tell my emotions clearly. I can be very nonchalant at times. Maybe that’s something I need to work on lol. I also don’t know what his interest would be towards me. Maybe I missed some signs in the past? I mean it’s been years of friendship and I feel like I’ve been actively trying not to catch feelings and putting him in a friendzone because I really like our dynamic and can’t imagine him not in my life. I’d really hate to say something and it ruins our dynamic. I think realistically I could say something and he’d be super understanding, but the fear of making it awkward kinda scares me. There is more, but this paragraph is becoming too long. I always thought guys and girls could be platonic, but this is really tripping me up.\n",

      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "I love my partner of five years—he’s kind, supportive, and takes care of our home—but I’m overwhelmed working full-time, going to school, and handling side hustles. My job is ending soon, and while he says he’s job hunting, he hasn’t landed a single interview despite months of trying. I need him to step up financially so I can focus on school, but I’m starting to worry that we have different levels of ambition. I don’t want to nag or hurt him, but I’m unsure how to move forward if we’re not aligned.\n",
      "\n",
      "——\n",
      "\n",
      "I've (25F) been with my partner (28 M) for five years. He’s loving, supportive, and my best friend. Lately, things have been tense—my young adult brother and his dog moved in, and our small home is chaotic and not the sanctuary I’d like it to be. Still, my partner has been incredibly patient. He cooks, cleans, helps with the animals, and constantly asks how he can support me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a full-time grad student, working a full-time nonprofit job, and juggling side hustles to make ends meet. I’m the eldest daughter of an immigrant family and have always felt the pressure to be ambitious and self-sufficient. But lately, I’m completely burned out—mentally, emotionally, and physically. I’m always working or thinking, and I never get a real break.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, my partner works from home for a big company. He makes the same as I do, but has a max of 2 hours of actual work each day. The rest of the time, he’s on his phone, going to the gym, smoking weed, or doing stuff around the house. He says he wants a new job and is applying, but it’s been months with no interviews or serious leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m trying not to judge him—I know job hunting can be tough. But I also know how driven I am, and it’s hard to see him spinning his wheels while I’m constantly at my limit. When I try to help with job leads or give tips, he gets frustrated. But when he asks how he can help me, my honest answer is to “find a better-paying job.” It would relieve so much stress for me—not just financially, but mentally. I would much way rather him work on application/outreach techniques to land a new job compared to doing my laundry. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a few months, my job is ending. I’ll still be working part-time and doing side gigs while finishing school, but losing my main income is a huge shift. We’ve known this was coming, and I’ve tried to be transparent. I need him to step up, not with housework, but financially. I’m not asking for a CEO salary—just enough to help us make it through my final 10 months of school, maintain our modest lifestyle, and reduce the pressure on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t about gender roles. We’ve always agreed we both want to work and contribute. It’s about ambition. I want a partner I can rely on when things get tough—someone who sees the value in doing what it takes to build a future together. I want him to want that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve been together a long time, and I’m reaching a point where I need clarity: Can we build a stable, ambitious future together, or are our goals and work ethics just too different? I love him deeply, but I’m afraid love alone might not be enough anymore.\n",

      "Title: Is my bf mooching and should I end it?\n",
      "Body text: I 23 (f) and my bf, 21 (m) have been dating for about 3 and a half years now. The relationship started out pretty good with us being supportive of one another for the most part. However there have been quite a few situations where I feel my bf has almost seemed unmotivated and uninterested to fix. Recently these issues have gotten worse, on the day before valentines of this year he informed me he had been out of a job since December of 2024. This made sense considering I was slowly starting to pay for everything on our date nights and to be fair he would make an effort when he had money but that would be very sparingly. I was furious to say the least since he hid it from me and I was planning really fun things for us to do on Valentine’s Day but was expecting some form of help with the plans since I couldn’t pay for it all myself, especially because I was telling him a month in advance what we were doing. \n",
      "\n",
      "My bf has also never really mentioned any future plans for himself career wise in our relationship and I have brought this up in the past as well since that is important to me. He’s not attending any school and hasn’t had any jobs that could lead up to a successful career if you stay in the business, most of the time it’s jobs for teens. When we had our argument I did lay it out flat for him that he needed to find a job within a month and also start having some goals for his future within the next few months or else I would end the relationship. Well….its been nearly three months and he has still yet to find a job. Again I will give it to him he has been “trying”, but he also tends to fall asleep around 7pm till 12am which is time that could be used doing something productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other things I should mention is that he has not had a car for basically majority of our relationship and I drive everywhere, that was another thing I would bring up pretty often with him was any updates about getting a car and it would always be the same excuse of, “we can’t be going out once a week if you expect me to get a car.” This was before he lost his job. \n",
      "\n",
      "We planned a vacation for the beginning of May and it’s already paid for however he barely has any money saved up for it since he used all of his savings on other things. He doesn’t go to most of our friend hang outs because I stated it probably wasn’t the best idea to go considering he needed to save for our vacation and I was unwilling to continue paying for him everywhere we went and for the most part he was understanding of that, however I know how he is and I know it does bother him. \n",
      "\n",
      "80% of me is wanting to end the relationship and most of my friends are advising me that I should however they’re multiple factors that are not helping. For one, one of his close relatives just passed recently, two, we have our vacation coming up with our friends and I really do not want to make it awkward, and 3 his bday is at the end of May which is REALLY bad timing. I do love him and even though part of me is telling me to end it I know another part of me is wanting to give him another chance but idk if it is because I’m comfortable in the relationship. If I do end the relationship it will be after our vacation but I’m wondering if I should still end it even if he does end up getting a job by then. I am really looking for an unbiased opinion here. ( I should also mention I am driving him to an interview in a couple days….)\n",

      "Body text: I’m not sure what to do and how much of anything I’m experiencing is normal. I (29f) and my husband (30m) have been together since high school. We met performing, he was the sweetest guy and such a talented actor and singer. He still is! We got together after he graduated and we moved in together when I got into college. We got married at 23 and 24 before the pandemic. \n",
      "He has always been really anxious and self conscious. To the point where he will self sabotage himself. For example, he doesn’t brush his teeth because he always had bad teeth and feels bad about it. I’ve always tried my best to be supportive and assure him where I can, but it gets exhausting supporting him all the time. He is now getting help with meds and a counselor he doesn’t like. \n",
      "I’ve been out of work for a bit due to a workplace injury so I’m not able to work. He’s had trouble holding onto a job for as long as I’ve known him due to him always calling in from illness (which we are checking him out for with his doctor now), and just work being non existent. Plus he has trauma from his last job working security. He’s a very emotional person, I know. It’s what I love about him, but\n",
      "Now it’s getting to be a lot. I have talked to him about being too emotionally reliant and dependent on me but he only just started to understand how that’s a problem. \n",
      " On his birthday, he was basically offered a job on the spot in his favourite industry: cannabis! Not only that, it was over minimum and a supervisor position! But now, after one day of working, he’s so sick he’s been vomiting and he decided he is going to quit weed because he realizes how addicted he was to it. \n",
      "I’m not going to tell him he NEEDS to smoke it, but he wants to quit now after finally getting a job. He doesn’t want to work being surrounded by his vice and selling it without knowing the product first hand. So now he wants to go on disability so he can afford to call in when he can.\n",
      "My car just crapped out, i just bought him a bike today (used from Facebook marketplace), he doesn’t drive and we live in my parents basement. We have been living off of my unemployment/disability, groceries from my parents, and I’m always saving and having to spend it all. On top of all this, I just signed up for Pilates to help with my mental and physical health (the biggest expense I’ve made in a while for myself) which I only felt comfortable with because my mom paid for half and he said “don’t worry, I’m working now!” But now he’s not.\n",
      "I want to be supportive of him. I want to support him and his ambitions, but I’m getting so tired. I don’t want to abandon him when he’s just coming off of an addiction, or when he’s not feeling well, or when he’s only starting to realize that what he’s doing is hurting both of us, but I feel like I’ve done everything I can that I’m too exhausted and it’s all coming too late. \n",

      "Body text: I (38F) have been with my bf (44M) for almost a year. For the most part, it’s been really good. He’s caring and hilarious. We seem to work well for each other. However, the problems lie in his severe depression, the sheer amount of change he’s undergone and all the pressure he’s under. He was fresh out of a separation and then officially divorced within a month of us dating. That was a concern alone. I soon learned he was basically couch/hotel surfing until he closed on a home he purchased 30 mins from his kids’ school. The house he purchased was an extreme fixer upper. He’s put a lot of work into it but not even a year later wants to sell because it’s too far from the kids’ mom and me. We never go there (it’s quite uncomfortable, doesn’t have a functioning stove so we can’t cook, and is almost an hour away from me. I have a dog that I can’t subject to that kind of travel all the time.) Also, he’s a newly single dad to three boys all 6 and under. It’s a lot to juggle. With this as a base, the following events have occurred during our relationship: his aunt passed away, he got into a terrible car accident, had minor back surgery, and just recently lost his best friend to suicide. He battles depression daily, is on meds, but no longer sees a therapist. He cries A LOT, which I just don’t think is normal, or a sign of healthy coping? I don’t really know. He says he doesn’t need a therapist but just needs to go into the woods for a spell, and just feel his feelings and push through/use the tools he’s learned over the years he HAS gone to a therapist. (My argument is, it’s a journey and an ongoing conversation with someone unbiased, especially after the year he’s had is needed.)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this to say, we are a year into it and I haven’t seen him truly happy or at ease during the majority of our relationship. I worry for him and how he’s dealing, but I also feel my needs aren’t being met. We barely have time together and when we do, it’s very brief and it’s basically me asking if he’s ok, if I can do x,y,z for him, or just sitting with him through it. Is a year too soon for all of this? We haven’t had a vacation (not a real one) and we just seem to have stagnated. I love him but I fear he jumped into something too soon and didn’t take time to truly heal from, well everything. I’m at a loss. What do I do, Reddit? Do I stay? Or ask him to take the time he needs? I’m so torn. He’s great, but he’s a shell of a person and I don’t know if I can carry this on. I feel like a terrible person, but as a single parent, I too need support from my partner that I’m just not getting. But he just lost his friend. How can I even expect him to be able to be there for someone else right now? Do I wait it out? Would resentment just set in? I’ve never been in a position like this where my partner was basically drowning very early on in our relationship. I’m heartbroken. \n",

      "Body text: I (17F) have been dating my (17M) boyfriend for 6 months, and we got together through a friend (basically a put-on). My friend said we would suit eachother really well, and that we are the same person but opposite gender. I felt this way too. I truly enjoyed our talking stage, and I really loved hanging out with him and going on dates. Around the 3 month mark, we both joined a competitive extra-curricular together and it was really fun. We don’t go to the same school, so it was nice to see eachother. Around the end of this activity (the 4 month mark) we were off to finals. On the bus ride there (a 4 hour bus ride), I request that I sit alone instead of sitting with him (which i ended up sitting directly behind him so we could chat if he wanted) because I have terrible back and knee problems and I really just wanted one seat to myself so I could move around as I wish. My friend (16F) asked if she could sit with me and I kindly said “no, i want to sit alone im sorry” around 3 times, and he heard because he also asked and I said no. After the third time, she sat with me, even though i said no and I tried to get her to get up and she wouldnt. She’s one of my best friends and she’s kind of like a little sister to me so I felt bad making her get up. I didn’t talk to her much, but we did watch a video or two together on tiktok and I guess he heard us. He sent me a LOOONG paragraph or 2 about how it isn’t fair and that she should not be sitting with me and he should, and about how i dont put effort into the relationship. Currently, I am juggling an SAT and 3 AP exams coming up, and I have been really stressed out. Ever since that day, I kind of realized the type of relationship he is looking for and i quickly noticed that we do not have the same goals for a relationship. I so badly want to break up with him but I feel so terrible because i’m afraid I am going to lose respect from my friends who have been rooting for us from the start, and I’m afraid they’ll judge me for breaking up with him. I just don’t feel attracted to him, and I don’t feel the urge to want to see him or hangout with him anymore. He deserves so much more and it’s so bad to the point i cry every time i think of breaking up because im so afraid to hurt him. It’s his first relationship and he says he thinks we’re soulmates. I truly disagree and I really don’t think we’re meant for eachother, and i’m truly not happy in this relationship. I don’t want to force myself into something I am unhappy with.\n",

      "Title: I(26F) feel like an awful person who's fallen in love with my best friend(26F)\n",
      "Body text: Throughout the first few years of college, I had one girl I constantly saw around the same campus building I was in at the same time. I even changed programs completely, to a different ‘college’ within the same university, and then kept seeing her around. And she was hot. In my head, I even had a, frankly, derogatory nickname for her about how hot she was, that I wish had never left my head, but enough people now know it that I couldn’t put it here without probably outing myself with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then junior year, one of my DND players I DM’ed for told me to come meet her hanging out with a new friend she made, who had switched majors in the exact same way I had, and ‘isn’t that crazy’. It didn’t even click for me until I showed up at the fast food place, saw my friend, sat down, and realized I was sitting across from *her*. Then, even as I reeled from now thinking of her by her actual name instead of the nickname in my head, it all clicked for us to become best friends. We had the same interests in storytelling and fantasy, so had movie nights and long nights talking about DND, we had the same mindset in planning and scheduling so once a night, every week, she became the rock of our DND’s groups scheduling, and none of the issues others had of bad planning or out of campaign and being flaky, or in campaign and doing things they regret in the campaign that would make things awkward in game and out of game as we had to step back and work though it - and none of that ever happened with her. We were just friends through it all, any thoughts of attraction from me long forgotten for years, besides telling the story of how I had thought she was hot and the crazy coincidence of the meeting I told when I was way too drunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "People came and went from the campaign for years, but once a week, every week, whether in person, just her in discord while the rest of us were in person, or all of us in discord, she would show up to DND, with at most the day of the week having to change. Two girlfriends came and went, both going awfully, the first becoming friends with her through me, but nothing more, and the second coming and going from the campaign with the relationship. We hung out outside of DND as well, having hangouts and trips to restaurants even after graduating from college. She saw me at my shitty worsts of being awful with handling relationships(both relationships I essentially let myself get treated like some terrible secret that had to be hidden from their family so everything had to be on their terms and their time) and outbursts that included throwing things without thinking that almost hit her, but she’s stayed friends with me as I got better and got on medication for my issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now… she’s the only one left of the campaign. I got kicked out of the house I was living in(and I hope it’s a testament of us still being friends that I truly don’t think this was my fault either, as I know I’m not the best person and I surely didn’t handle it the best, but the one roommate had a literal psychotic break and the other one literally would be homeless if she left and is very codependent, so felt she had to side with her - but giving this context just as more evidence of her having seen how messy I am with life in general) and with it went the other two members at the time, so now it’s just the two of us continuing it as a duo campaign to finish it up and bring it home, having a blast with the world we’ve been in for five years, and shooting the shit before, after, and throughout the session. And after every single call or meeting, I sit back and can’t help but think “fuck, I’ve fallen in love with her, you piece of shit.” I don’t know if she even likes girls, she’s only ever had a few dates with guys that fizzled out, and I basically purposefully avoid probing about romance while she doesn’t bring it up either, and she deserves so much better than me. I’m not a good person, it’s a miracle that, per chance, I wasn’t the reason either of my old relationships ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to spend every week the rest of my life with her… and I already have that, as a friend. I feel like I can’t be in love with her, but it doesn’t matter; I am. I feel like if there’s even a chance things wouldn’t work, I will have ruined things forever… but if I just keep ignoring everything to stay friends with her and find out five years down the road she does like me or would have said yes, I’d never forgive myself. And now I live much further away from her, due to said forced move, even if we still talk weekly, and I visit where she lives for doctor’s appointments frequently because I’m not of the best health. Despite all that, we've started hanging out more and more lately, not just for DND and only weekly scheduled event, but general gaming and chatting multiple times a week as well. But that second relationship ended when the ex-gf away as she moved back in with her parents for a job and practically regressed to treating our relationship like a high school forbidden romance, which makes me super worried about even trying anything at distance anymore/again. I guess I just don’t know what to do, having literally no one to talk about any of this with. Do I start probing, and if so, how would I even do that? Do I ask or try anything at all, or just ignore it until I’m in an even better spot… or just forever to keep the status quo of our friendship?\n",

      "Body text: We were having a nice Sunday dinner after a tough week together. Something has been going on where she just hasn't seemed happy with anything I do. She seems to really latch on to the small things, and bring up things where I think it's not a big deal or a waste of time.\n",

      "A great example is we had a tee time with her sister and brother in law. It started raining bad about an hour before the teetime so I called the pro shop, and they said they were still letting people out so I texted them were still good to go. When we left 30 min later, and on our 30 min drive to the course it was still raining like crazy. I asked her to call again just to make sure, and instead of just calling, she was like \"why did you text them we were good then?\" \"If they said they are letting people out still why double check\" and I got frustrated and said \"just do it\" then I got in trouble for talking to her that way. This same argument has popped up several time over the past week, including one where I used a $10 replaceable bin to clean my grilling equipment. Each time I let her get out all the \"changes\" she needs to see from me, I apologize and try better.\n",

I feel like I can't do anything right while I'm the one who is the bread winner, cleans most of the house (interior and exterior) cooks dinner every night, and does the dishes. We also go on about two dates a week after 5 years, and I still initiate sex 1-2 times a week. When I ask for one day of alone time out of seven days, she took it as me calling her annoying and bothersome\n",

We talked through a lot of her problems, and I started to talk about my anxiety and the different forms of it I have faced the past 5 years of our relationship. Whether that be her family, my family, work, friends and loniless, etc. We we're having a good talk then she took a sudden shift where she didn't want to hear it anymore, and called it a mood killer. I was really taken aback and just destroyed the good conversation we were having that felt like we were getting somewhere.

      "Title: Challenging sibling dynamics between me (27F) and older sister (32F). How do I set boundaries?\n",
      "Body text: I (27F) am feeling like I’m at breaking point with my older sister (32F). We live in different parts of the world so see each other once a year at most. Since my early teens, I have found our relationship challenging and she has mentioned things that make me feel like she feels it is too. She is straight cut, A type personality. Excelled in extra curricular actives, head role in high school, excelled in university, moved overseas at 21 and found a great job, marathon runner, travels for work, she is very extroverted and has a lot of friends. I lean more towards free range. I went to a very diverse art focused high school, backpacked for 5 years, spent a bit of time in meditation spaces, volunteered, I am certainly a hippie at heart. We are just different, like water and oil. \n",
      "\n",
      "My sister has always bullied me. As a child she would physically hurt me in different ways for example holding me down and covering my nose and mouth until I was convulsing. She would make things up so that my dad would hit me (we were physically punished as kids). As a teenager she was mean to me verbally. She would comment on my clothing choices, my friends, laugh at me when I cried. She retells stories but exaggerates or makes up details to make the story more interesting even if it is at the expense of someone else’s embarrassment. And as an adult I find she still hurts me this way. I’m unsure if this is just who she is, or if there is some older-younger sibling dynamic here that we are unable to click out of. Mental health issues run in our family mostly anxiety but also my mother who has bipolar and is low functioning. We did not have a secure upbringing. \n",
      "\n",
      "My sister has a very reactive personality where she will go from 1-10 without much warning. I used to be the same but worked through a lot of the anger through 4 years of therapy. Now I bite my tongue around her but I am easily triggered by her. In times of vulnerability or crisis she is quick to criticize what I am doing, gives advice (even if explicitly say that I need emotional support not advice) or laughs/smile at me when I’m sharing something challenging. Her current default response is manifesting good vibes/it’s not a big deal kind of response which is challenging when there is some real life challenges at face. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 years ago, I had a phone call with her about it as I was thinking of going no contact. I brought the bullying up and how I was not okay with it. It was a hard conversation for us both. She was defensive but heard what I was saying. She admitted that she knows that she is mean to people and had been thinking about it recently. I was glad to hear she was aware and thinking about it. I made an effort to make a point that we are both adults, hope to see each other as equals or at least people who are living different lives and believe that we can both learn from each other. It felt like time to create more space to communicate our needs from each other sisters and work on a relationship as adult siblings. She had never had a conversation with anyone like this before and it was challenging for her but things shifted after that. She decided to start therapy but dropped it after the second session. \n",

      "Fast forward to today. I have an under 1 year old with my partner and we are living in a new country. My sister is coming to visit us for 3 weeks. I did not ask her to come, she and her partner booked themselves in. I’m okay with them coming and was feeling excited as I could really use the company as I have no support system here (my partner goes away for 2 weeks at a time for work - first responder) but I am feeling anxious about the amount of extra work it will be for me along side solo parenting as well as having her in the house for that long. They visited me and my parents last year after my baby was born to ‘help out with the baby’. They stay with us and did not contribute to any food, groceries, petrol, planning of outings, helping the baby and did not help with anything in the house including things like doing their dishes. I did all of their washing, my partner did 95% of the cooking. She criticized and critiqued how I take care of my baby, how post partum has been for me (complicated birth) and kept giving us advice on how her friends do things. I need to have a conversation around expectations for when they are here but I am anxious about how she will react. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday I was sharing how the move to this new country is, it has been stressful as it’s been a challenging to finding a rental, find a car, finances are tight, my partner starting a new job and being in a new continent with no one I know. She and her partner are two incomes, live in London and own their home. They travel monthly for work and pleasure. There is also some political stuff going on here in the country I am in which has been keeping me up at night so I shared about that. I was almost in tears while sharing this and she laughed at me and said “geez sounds like you’re stressed, maybe we should talk another time.” I told her, “yes I am stressed, I haven’t shared with anyone what’s going on for me. It’s a lot but I’d like to talk” and she said “we are in arms length coming out to see you. Seems like you don’t want us to come”. I apologized that she felt this way and explained that it wasn’t like that for me, more that I’m feeling a lot in my life right now and was hoping to have an empathetic ear to support me (she also lives overseas so thought she would have some compassion). She then went on to explain how she wants our mum, my sister and Aunty, who none of us are close to, to visit at the same time. This would be 5 people on top of my partner and daughter in our house including my mum who has very little independence and needs a lot of assistance. I explained why I didn’t think this would be a good idea and that we can’t fit 5 people in our house. Her response was that it would be my mums only chance to see her as they probably wont see each other two years. \n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation ended after she told me for the 3rd or 4th time not to strsss and I told her to please stop telling me not to stress. She laughed at me again, telling me that it was time to end the call because I’m clearly overwhelmed and she felt like she was going to say the wrong thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel unheard and belittled. She can not accept boundaries from me. She can’t see me as an equal or at least as an adult living my own life. She has conflict with my other family members too but no one will say anything because they want to keep the peace. It makes me really sad. I don’t know what to do or what to say. We are going to have a follow up call next week, but I am afraid of her reactiveness. I am also anxious about sharing honestly with her because she takes things personally. If she was a friend, I would break up the friendship so why do I keep her around a sister? \n",

How do I navigate open and honest conversations with her when we both feel attacked?\n",

      "Title: I (19F) am emotionally burnt out over my relationship with my boyfriend (18M)\n",
      "Body text: Hello... I apologize if the formatting isn't correct or some other technicality, this is my first post ever on reddit and I am in need of advice on what to do with my boyfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I started dating a little over 3 months ago; we both actively participate in the same club and met through mutual friends in said club. In the beginning, everything seemed to be going perfectly- we agreed on everything and had the exact same views on legitimately every topic that I could think of. Because of this, we had a lot of frequent conversation that was also meaningful at the same time. We both went out of our way to talk to each other and I believe this is what most would call the \"honeymoon\" phase of our relationship. However... at about only one month of dating... I noticed him to already start to check out of the relationship- i.e. he wasn't texting, making plans, or calling as much as he used to. Due to my belief that communication is the most important thing in all relationships- platonic or romantic- I let him know what I noticed and was met with an immediate apology and \"I'll do better in the future\". As you may assume because of me posting this... he did not do better. I've already communicated clearly and directly what I would appreciate him doing in a relationship and what I would need him to do to make things work; yet still even after reassuring me and telling me how doable all of these things are, he still does not do any of them. Yes, for a day or so he will attempt to do them, but after that things go right back to normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to me being persistent (and honestly kind of a stubborn idiot), I still try and bring up how much his lack of communication and effort into our relationship has been bothering me. Even though every single time he only says that he will do better and no action will occur to actually be better. Please let it be noted that I haven't ever been shameful in my communication, I always phrase it in a \"Hey, I've noticed \\_\\_\\_\\_, is everything ok? because the way you have been communicating has been kind of bothering me and I'd like to talk about it.\" I also do understand that everyone has different views of how much communication is needed to maintain a relationship, yet in the beginning parts of our dating we had full on discussions about this and we both seemed to agree on pretty consistent communication being needed. Another thing is, I do realize 3 months is not a long time whatsoever, it's just that (this is a little bit delusional) I felt such a connection and bond with him initially so it has become really hard for me to even think about ending things. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also... other slight things have been bothering me about him. Like for example he has this friend in another country that he had a crush on before we met, and throughout the three months of dating he has brought up this girl an insane amount of times and has even told her details about our intimate life which I was not comfortable with. Whenever I brought up the fact that he still has a crush on this girl, I was met with a \"I can't view her as anything other than a crush\" and a \"your brain can't help itself from having crushes\". This honestly still bothers me and any advice on this topic alone would be appreciated- regardless of the other stuff. Another example of something that bothered me is how he switched a date into a hang out with 3 of his friends (2 of whom I have never met) and got upset when I told him I wasn't comfortable... saying that I was \"refusing\" the one time he is in charge of making the plans (please note he also changed the plans on me the day of). Then... the next day arrives and he is supposed to meet one of my friends and he changes the location completely to where she can't make it anymore... and then proceeds to get mad at my friend. Other things have bothered me yes, but these are the main points along with the lack of communication and effort on his end. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do I end things with him? This all has been so emotionally draining to me and I can't determine whether or not I'm just crazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would greatly appreciate any advice or criticism. Thank you for reading this post. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend (18M) has not been communicating nor putting the effort into the relationship with me (19F) anymore.... he has a crush on one of his other friends... and just has other icks in general. Yet I still am with him because I do not know how to end it or if I am justified for even slightly wanting to end things. \n",

      "Body text: We’ve been together for 4 years, on and off at the beginning. I moved in with him and his two children, (10F) (11F), and I don’t even know where to start or what to say. He has these moods where he completely changes, he can be so lovey and then all of a sudden he’s acting like he doesn’t care about anything. I don’t really want advice for our specific situation. I just want to know, if our time is really up this time, how any of you got the strength to leave? What did you? I have no where else to go, my mum is being evicted and she’s going into a place with one less bedroom, my nan lives too far out of the way to get to my job, and that’s it, they’re my only options. I don’t earn enough for my own place (minimum wage 0 hour contract) and it’ll take too long to find a better paying job. I know that if I wait it out his mood will turn and he’ll be fine again, but this will just keep happening, deep down I think part of me knows it’s over, but it feels like I have no life outside of him and the kids. I’ll lose him, my home, my kids, my cats, and half the furniture I paid for. I have no idea what do or where to start. I’ve put my blood sweat and tears into this family, given up so much of my life. I love him, but I’m not sure he loves me the same way anymore\n",

      "Body text: I've been dating my boyfriend for a year now. I'm in my last year of university, and swamped with work because of my graduation project (the deadline is in 20 days).\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend often says he's an overthinking, and has issues because of his previous relationships. At first, since we went out on dates often, I went over to his place and we met and spent time alone in college, the instances of his starting a conversation about us and his fears regarding the relationship happened once every 2 months. But lately, I've been a lot more busy with work, constantly working on my laptop, going to places for research, and completing my project in the short span we were given. Because of this, the number of dates we go on has decreased. He constantly asks me out on dates or for me to come over, and I try to do so whenever I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, recently he brings up this topic every few days or so. About his fears and how he's scared I might leave him, especially since we'll be in a long distance relationship for a few months once I go for my job. He says we might fall out of love, or not make enough time for each other, and every time I tell him that despite the distance, I'll still love him, and we'll make it work (along with an entire conversation).\n",
      "\n",
      "But at this point, I've started getting overwhelmed with all of this. Because lately it's been how I've been really busy, and how he feels neglected and how I don't ask him how his day goes, and how i don't tell him I love him. Which I do. If I explain myself, it's always \"my bad, sorry, you have a lot of work\" and that's it. He either changes the topic or goes to work, while I stop my work just to have this conversation. And the reason this has really ruffled my feathers is because he's the one who hasn't been doing these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says he understands I have work, but I really don't think he does. Because every two days, I drop my work for hours to hear him talk about his problems, his insecurities, how he has to deal with people. All while not receiving a single \"how are you, how's your work going\" from him. And after all that, he still says I haven't been showing him enough affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really don't know what to do at this point. The most recent conversation we had about this was right now, and he just said whatever he wanted to and went to sleep. I know I should be more explicit about how I feel, but I know he's gonna apologise and drop the conversation like always. And I try to understand his POV, and all this would've been fine if he, too, understood mine. It's been getting exhausting and draining, and now it's affecting my work. I don't know how to approach this, and if this keeps happening, I feel like I'll explode one day.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rundown: A few months ago I ask this girl (F18) out to prom which is now about 2 weeks away, I only asked as friends but she might see me as more than that, and to be frank I definitely saw her as more than that at the time of me asking. She goes to my school, plays the same sport and we've known each other for years. We also have a lot of the same friends and the friendgroup used to have monthly game nights.. part of me asking was probably partially because 2 other couples in the group had recently come about, which planted the seed in my head. After asking her to prom a few months ago we've hung out for maybe a few hours and it's been the only time we've really talked or spent time together. She's a very poor texter which has also been a concern..\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks ago I reconnected with F17, we met earlier this year in an academic competition, she goes to another nearby school, we have many shared interests, and since reconnecting we've stayed up LATE every night talking. The communication with her is extremely good and she's just an all around great person. Its clear that we both see each other in a romantic way and I told her the truth about my situation having already asked someone out as friends. She's made attempts to work around our busy schedules which to me shows that she genuinely cares and is willing to try to make things work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Im not dating F18 by any means but she might be into me and I don't want to lead her on, I also don't want to ruin prom night/the friendgroup, so when/how should I handle this.\n",

      "Title: How do I [F20] move forward when someone [F19] who hurt me is still in my boyfriend’s [M19] life?\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and we’ve been going through a lot lately. One of the biggest things we’re stuck on is something that’s been bothering me for a long time now, and I don’t know what to do anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s this girl (let’s call her “L”) who became part of our friend group last year. There was a lot of drama with her—she told people, including people in my boyfriend’s friend group, that me and my two closest friends were excluding her or being mean, when that wasn’t true. That created a lot of tension and division, and since then, she’s gotten closer to his best friend and is now dating him. So she’s still around a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, my boyfriend has never really made an effort to include me in his own friend group. I’ve met them, but I’ve never felt like I was really part of it. So now it feels extra frustrating that someone who hurt me gets to be accepted and included in that space, while I’ve always kind of been on the outside. I feel like I’m the one who got pushed away, while she’s still comfortably in the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend is trying. He listens and wants to make things better. But I don’t feel like we’ve found a way forward. I’ve told him how I feel, but the situation hasn’t changed, and I’m still dealing with the same emotions. I know I can’t tell him who to be friends with, and I don’t want to be controlling, but it’s hard not to feel like this is a dealbreaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess I’m just trying to figure out what to do. Do I just accept that she’s in his life and try to manage my feelings around it? Do I need to step back from the relationship? Set stronger boundaries? I feel like I’ve hit a wall and I’m stuck between holding onto the relationship and protecting my peace.\n",

      "My boyfriend’s friend group includes someone who hurt me badly, and I’ve never felt fully included by him or his friends. It’s created a block in our relationship that we haven’t been able to move past, and I don’t know what to do anymore.\n",

      "Title: My '21F' Boyfriend '22M' Doesn't Know How Long We Will Last\n",
      "Body text: Hi everyone. So my boyfriend (22M) and I (21F) started dating about 7 months ago, and things have been pretty smooth so far. From the beginning, he told me that he has trust issues because his ex cheated on him and it really messed up his ability to get attached to people. Yet, he assured me that he really does want to date me, and he was very sure he was ready for a relationship. I trusted him and assumed all would be fine, until recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few nights ago, I started to realize that I have put a lot more effort into the relationship than he has and it got me thinking about how serious he is about our relationship. So I brought it up to him, and explained that sometimes I feel as if I’m a bit more invested than he is, and I want to make sure we are on the same page as far as how we feel about the relationship. He essentially told me that while he really likes me, and values me as a person, he doesn’t know if we will last for more than a few months from now. I asked him why he thinks so, and he said that he has a tendency to start distancing himself from others out of the blue. He said it’s not because he doesn’t like them, or because he doesn’t care about them anymore, but he just becomes very emotionally detached.\n",
      "\n",
      "This obviously made me anxious, because he told me he was ready for a relationship. We didn’t get in an argument or anything, but I asked him if he thought we would make it through the summer and he said “I’m not sure”. He even said he doesn’t know if we’ll make it through the next two months. The issue is that I truly do like him a lot. He’s a very sweet guy and I feel like I’ve made a lot of memories with him so far. He told me he doesn’t want or feel like he wants to break up soon, but he doesn’t know when that feeling of “distance” will come on. The fact that he doesn’t even know if we’ll make it through the summer really gutted me, and I just don’t know how to go about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He basically said he might break up with me in the next few months, or maybe not for a year. But he’s not sure. Do I just need to break it off with him now? Should I try to talk to him more about it? It sounds like he’s not emotionally available, and I don’t want to sit around “waiting” to see when he’s going to break up with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend says he might break up with me within the next few months, but he has no idea. I don't know how to proceed, and if this relationship is going down the drain.\n",

      "Title: Am I (26F) overstepping by wanting to set a boundary with my (25F) girlfriend’s (56F) mom’s influence on our relationship?\n",
      "Body text: I (26F) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (25F) for about 3 months. Things have been great overall—we really click, have similar values, and I feel like we’re building something solid. However, there’s been some tension that I’m starting to feel frustrated by, and I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mom (56F), who my girlfriend is very close with, has a lot of opinions and expectations, and it seems like every time we talk about the future, her mom’s voice is there, influencing the direction of things. We had a conversation recently about moving in together and other aspects of our future, and I accidentally mentioned “when we get a dog” in front of her mom. That set her mom off, and my girlfriend got uncomfortable because of it. She expressed that her mom gets nervous about me and that she wants us to move slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I’m not trying to rush anything or push her into a decision. But I’ve made it clear from the start that I want to live with her within the next couple of years. That doesn’t seem unreasonable to me, especially since we’re in a committed relationship, but she’s more focused on waiting until she’s financially ready, and she’s still figuring things out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s been especially frustrating is that her mom has also gossiped about me behind my back. I’ve tried to be understanding, but it’s hard to stay patient when I feel like there’s a lack of respect for me. It’s not just the influence; it’s also the undermining and talking about me to others that makes things feel even more complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also know that her mom has had a difficult past relationship with her ex-girlfriend, which seems to have had a big impact on how she views future partners in my girlfriend’s life. Her mom’s ex-girlfriend love-bombed her and left a complicated mess, and it seems like that’s caused her mom to hold on to unrealistic expectations for what my girlfriend’s relationships should look like. This seems to be influencing how she views me, and I’m caught in the middle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’m at a point where I feel like I’m stuck between wanting to move forward and needing her to set boundaries with her mom. It feels like I’m being pulled in two directions: I’m doing my best to be patient, but I can’t shake the feeling that her mom’s influence is holding us back. I’ve expressed that I don’t want to live in a “maybe” situation where everything hinges on her mom’s approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve told her I can’t keep feeling like I’m waiting indefinitely—if by the 6-month mark, nothing has changed, I’ll need her to choose: either she accepts that her mom will never fully approve of me, or we’ll have to break up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, am I overstepping by wanting my girlfriend to draw clearer boundaries with her mom? Am I asking for too much too soon, or am I just trying to move forward in a healthy way?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; I (26F) have been dating my girlfriend (25F) for 3 months, but her mom (56F) is very involved and it’s causing tension. I want to move in together in the next couple of years, but my girlfriend wants to take things slower, partly due to her mom’s concerns from her OWN past relationship with a woman. I’m also frustrated because her mom gossips about me behind my back. I told my girlfriend that if nothing changes by our 6 months, I might have to walk away. Am I overstepping by wanting her to set clearer boundaries with her mom and stop the gossiping?\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone,\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m 22 and my boyfriend is 26. We’ve been together for 3 years, and for the most part, it’s been a loving and supportive relationship. \n",
      "I met his family a while ago and we spend time together every now and then as he still lives with his parents.\n",
      "We recently spent the weekend together, and normally I feel great and comforted around him. But since they had his family over and his best friend (who is my cousin) and his girlfriend,I felt quite anxious and unsettled. \n",
      "I’m not even sure if this is about him or more about me feeling overwhelmed with life and me just being unsure of what I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I feel like I’m going through a bit of an existential crisis. I don’t feel quite the same since we had a serious argument back in December. I feel it shifted something as before, I used to over-care and be sooo understanding, but now it feels like I’m just quite emotionally drained. I of. still love and care for him deeply, but I’m struggling with this uncertainty \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that really gets to me is language barrier. We share the same ethnic background, but I’m not fluent in our language and I get really shy speaking it, especially around his family. It feels like I can’t fully express myself, and I hate that it makes me quiet and withdrawn, because I’m usually an outgoing person. I watch how easily others, like his best friend/my cousin’s girlfriend (who speaks fluently), connect with his family and it just makes me feel guilty. Like I keep imagining how it would probs be so nice for him and his family if i was like that.\n",
      "No one has said anything negative to me but I just can’t shake this internal pressure. I feel like if we were to get married, I’d constantly be reminded of this communication gap and feel awkward, while his parents might prefer someone more fluent and confident. And that just makes me feel so bad for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, him and his family/friends are at that age where marriage is a common topic and even though no one is pressuring me directly, I still feel a silent pressure. Like every decision I make now isn’t just about me, but about us, and about being a good potential wife, good daughter in law. And I just don’t feel ready. I don’t know what I want. I feel like I haven’t even figured myself out yet. I have been in a long term relationship since i was 18! I just feel so anxious and at a loss for who i am\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is he’s not holding me back, he is incredibly supportive and would stand by me no matter what I decide. But sometimes, that support makes it harder . Like I wish he would want to fight for me or say, “no please don’t leave’ would probably make it easier for me to decide. Ofc I know that’s selfish,—but I still feel frustrated that it’s all on me to decide, and no one is going to stop me if I walk away. Its another pressure i feel and now i feel anxious and stressed again\n",
      "I just feel so immature for a relationship and I feel like i have no clue what to do, im at a stage where im not really happy with myself, i have attachment issues and seek validation too much, theres just already so much going on within me, i feel like im rediscovering myself and i have no clue how to navigate this all\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if I want to be single, or if that’s just fear talking. I don’t want to make a huge decision I regret, but I also don’t want to stay in something out of guilt or fear. But i also dont want to leave out of fear. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I love my boyfriend of 3 years, but I feel emotionally overwhelmed and unsure of my future. Language barriers with his family make me feel self-conscious and guilty, and I feel immense pressure around the idea of marriage and not being “enough.” I don’t know if I need to take a break and figure myself out, or if I’m overthinking everything. I just feel lost.\n",

      "Body text: Hi, I (29F) am in a relationship with 32M (together shy of a year) and I am struggling to show him intimacy and affection. I have quite a bit going on (medical bills, a new medical diagnosis, new skin allergies, new food allergies, finished school and on the job hunt, two jobs, feeling depressed about getting older) and l've gotten a bit overwhelmed over the past few months and I have been struggling to show him affection. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him. My struggle with showing affection is taking a toll on him and our relationship and I don't want to lose him éo) I know we haven't been together long but I truly feel like he is my person and I am willing to do whatever to not lose him.\n",

      "To me, personally, I attribute it to me trying to work through the new challenges in my life and sometimes I get to a point mentally where I just want to be in my own world/bubble.

It's hard for me to show affection when I get to that point be I'm stressing and thinking about everything I have going on and trying to figure out what to do next.

      "Body text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been dating for just over a year. The relationship has been wonderful — he’s kind, funny, shares my values and interests, and I’ve genuinely felt safe and happy with him. I honestly didn’t think I’d find someone like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, about two months ago, I started experiencing serious anxiety and doubts about the relationship. It began affecting my health — I often feel a heavy pressure in my chest, low energy, and sometimes a strong urge to just run away or break up. It’s incredibly confusing because I do love him. I’m very attracted to him, we laugh a lot, and he hasn’t done anything to make me feel unsafe or unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently started therapy, which has helped a bit. My therapist believes I may have an anxious attachment style, likely linked to some childhood experiences. I also went through a work-related burnout this past winter, which definitely impacted my overall mental health.\n",

      "So lately my (19F) and my boyfriend's (18M) relationship is not really romantic anymore. We've been dating for a year and from the start of this year things are kinda going down the drain. We are fighting more and talking less, and I don't know why, I always try to tell him things that happened to me, anything just to start a conversation and his replies are still dry. He will say things like \"why are you so quiet all the time?\" and \"We don't talk like we used to.\" and \"We don't really have things to talk about nowdays.\" but I'm really trying to think of anything just to start a conversation. The fights that we've been having are mainly because something happed to me or I'm talking about how my friends did, in my opinion, stupid things and he always takes the other or opposite side and never agrees with me. I mean it's okay to have your own opinion, but when your significant other is always going against you it just feels draining. \n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn't like to listen about things that happed to me at school because \"it's always the same thing\", like for example when i get a bad grade he just tells me it's my fault for not studying instead of reassuring me (which he really doesn't do often) or telling me it's okay and that i will do better next time. He also knows very well that i studied whole night for the test. If i tell him that some part of my body hurts he just tells me that that's not new and it's again my fault. \n",
      "I really do try, I explain things that are not okay for me that he does or says but nothing changes. Our conversation is mainly just few words like: okay, good, yeah, nice. I mean we do have some normal conversations but they are not very long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last week I told him that I feel like we're drifting apart and asked him why is he not messaging me like he did few months ago, why doesn't he send me photos like he always did when he way doing anything and he just told me he doesn't have anything new to tell me. \n",
      "If he has nothing new why is he always messaging with his best friend (18M) and the bsf even calls him multiple times a day just because he has nothing to do. Trust me they are not gay if anyone is asking and I'm sure of that.\n",
      "I'm just really lost rn. Not even half a year ago he was the nicest boyfriend, every day he told me how much he loved me and how pretty I am and how he is so excited to see me and how he can't wait to spend time with me, but now i can't remember the last time he did any of these things. He tells me he loves me every day, but it just feels like it's some sort of duty he has to do every day and not because he really means it. \n",
      "\n",
      "This month is also really stressful for me because of school and he keeps telling me that after school is over we will talk about things, but his tone of voice it's not very kind or nice when he says that. I feel like it's gonna be a conversation where he tells me he doesn't know how are things gonna be, because I'm leaving for college in October and we will see each other like once or twice in two months. I kinda think that he's being distant because of that. He thinks that when I go to college I will find someone that is better than him and stupid things like that and I always tell him and ensure him that I live him no matter what and i always will, but he still has this kind of thoughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes i just feel like he's gonna break up with me because of me leaving. It's not like I'm leaving forever though? There are hundreds of couples who can do long distance and survived like that and are also happy. He just says that everything will be shitty and bad and just not good in general. I know that not everything will always be good and perfect, but when he really loves me this shouldn't be that much of a issue. \n",
      "I am really lost right now and don't know that to do. I really love him with all my heart and my family loves him too, I just don't wanna loose him. \n",
      "\n",
      "And just few things, we see each other at school and we spend time together mainly on fridays, but also some days after school. We haven't been seeing each other that often for like two months because of all the test at school, but at least we have been seening each other almost every friday. I think it's okay for couples to not spend every minute with each other, even when i really want to spend every day with him. \n",

We fight more, talk less, and he seems emotionally distant. I try to start conversations, but his responses are dry, and he rarely supports or reassures me when I’m upset. He dismisses my feelings and often sides against me in discussions, which feels draining. He used to be very loving, but now even saying \"I love you\" feels like a routine, not genuine. He says we’ll talk after school ends, but I’m afraid he’s thinking of breaking up, especially since I’m going to college soon and we won't see each other as often. I still love him deeply and don’t want to lose him, but I feel really lost and unsure what to do.\n",

      "Title: My (M20) girlfriend (F25) and I have been together almost 2 years and she never initiates sex and would be happy having sex once a month.\n",
      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",
      "\n",
      "This disparity in our sexual desires discourages me because I’ve heard numerous stories about how sex frequency naturally declines as people age and relationships settle into a routine. Unfortunately, my situation is already at the very low end of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

We have recently been in a lot of arguments because she really wants to get engaged and start a family very soon (soon being married at like 22, kids by 23 atleast). Where the issue is I don’t feel like I’m ready for that. Since I joined the military (air guard) I have been set back in time. I really am just getting into college and I personally feel like taking those steps would be a lot for me especially if I do make it into med school.

I (21F) have a boyfriend whos (21M). we started dating 2 weeks after \"talking\" and have been together for 2 years ever since. When we first started dating I really thought he was the loml but after everything I'm no longer sure. Recently we got into a huge argument that lasted for 3 days straight and ended up on us telling each other some really fucked up things. The argument started by me asking him why he spends more time with his friends then me . I would suggest to do things like going out to eat and going to the movies or taking trips to places but he would always say no AND do those said things with his friends. I obviously didn't get mad the first couple times because we could all use times with our friends but  it got to a point where he was supposed to enroll in college again (he dropped out)  but didn't do it because he went on a trip with his friends to Detroit and missed the deadlines to apply again. I also got him 3 jobs which he stopped/ quit because he simply didn't like it  and didn't have enough time with his friends and again started hanging out with his friends everyday instead of applying to different jobs and getting his shit together. Anyways in the heat of the argument he told me \"if you're making me choose between my friends or you I'm choosing my friends\". Mind you I never asked that question he  just blurted out . Whats crazier is that he met these friends not even 6 months ago. After hearing that I truly felt hurt and  immediately took a step back from our relationship .Ever since then I've started to lose feelings and stopped trying in our relation.  \n",

Edit: I brought up the concern when the frequency became daily to every other day, he suggested they stop speaking for a little. I’ve seen her reach out twice during that time. When I address her disrespectfulness (he told her they need to stop talking for a bit so that we can work on things, and she still reaching out) he says he can’t control her. This poses a problem in my eyes because he rightfully expects to be on speaking terms with her again at some point- he’s expressed that. \n",

      "Body text: My bf and I have been dating for almost a year now. We argue a lot over many things, but recently one of the main reasons is because I feel that he is now very different to the way he was when we first started dating, and I miss that old version of him. He is a fair bit older than me, and faces more \"adult\" problems in comparison as I am still in college living at home, whilst he is in the work field and has moved out etc. He's faced quite a bit of work issues in the past few months, working up to 50 hours a week, as well as minor money issues - not having enough money to fund his hobbies - etc. In the beginning of our relationship, he made me seem a lot more \"wanted\" by asking to see me almost every day of the week. For months, he played video games only a few times a month. Now, we see each other twice a week (we live 10 minutes apart), because he says he needs \"time for himself\" which is playing video games, no matter how much I tell him I miss him and want to see him. What I don't understand is how spending time after work with me isn't \"time for himself\". I asked him, \"do you care about what I need?\", which he responded \"I don't think I'm asking for much on a Friday night, I'm not prioritizing video games over you, I'm prioritizing myself, which I think is fair\". He has played video games every day after work for the past 3 nights. He did tell me he could see me tomorrow, and tag along with all the errands he needs to run, although there is an event I'd like to go to tomorrow asking him to go with me, which he said no to. I do think it's totally fair for him to have alone time after working a 10 hour shift, but I really miss the way he used to ask to see me multiple days a week. He says he misses me, but his actions do not make me feel missed or needed. I just want to see him more often. Am I supposed to just get through the feeling of this? Could there be a compromise?\n",

My partner is pretty normal she's always very honest about things and she had told me about this friend she has who for privacy reasons I'm going to call Fin. So she tells me about this Fin guy , like she's gives me his whole backstory how his dad was a drug addict and his mum died from an overdose in front of him like some really dark stuff and she was meeting up with him and stuff but every time I asked to meet up with this guy Fin but she always had an excuse. Anyway she one day tells me he went to prison and she even makes up a whole story for that saying he stole a jeep and got caught and everything and I even get a message from his Instagram talking about it saying how he's not aloud his phone anymore ect. It's been a year since then now and he apparently got a few weeks ago but she says that they're not talking anymore because he said some hurtful stuff to her on the phone and this didn't make me too suspicious because from what I heard he was a pretty unstable guy but tonight I just got that creeping suspicion in the back of my head and decided to look through Fin's Instagram I go through his followers, it's all bot accounts apart from me and her , I look through his following it's all bot accounts apart from me , her and a few friends. She has mentioned before he had friends outside of just her she's even mentioned them by name but no where in his followers or following do I see any of those people. Then I check Fin's profile there's only one photo and it looks suspiciously like something you'd see on Pinterest so I reverse image search it and it leads me to a Pinterest board (I would also like to point out my partner described Fin as looking exactly how he did on his Instagram) and I find tones of photos of the same guy all with different names no of them being Fin (I don't really know how Pinterest works but she uses it) so I saved the photos in a little document and now I'm just not sure if I should confront her about it or not?\n",

      "Title: Sexual and emotional disconnection, feeling drained, and wondering if I’m being too patient or should move on – Need advice\n",
      "Body text: I (24M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (24F) for about 1.5 years now. Early in our relationship, we had a strong emotional and sexual connection. We met while she was working on her master’s and I was finishing my bachelor’s degree. After about a month of dating, she left for a semester abroad in Spain for her Erasmus program, so we did long-distance for a while. During that time, we would see each other and have sex fairly regularly when we could meet up, but I did notice that when we were on calls or video chats, she seemed distant or off—sometimes seeming sad or like she wasn’t fully present in the relationship, though I never really understood why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once she came back from Erasmus, we moved in together, and that’s when things started to shift. During the time we were living together, she had two more semesters left: one where she wasn’t really doing much (just “chilling”) and another where she was writing her thesis. I was still doing my bachelor’s, so I was in a different stage of life than she was. This is where the frequency of sex started to dip significantly. Instead of the regular intimacy we used to have, it dropped to about 5-6 times a month—sometimes even less. I noticed she was becoming more withdrawn emotionally, and I felt like I was becoming more distant from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s been dealing with some low energy and sadness, which she’s expressed as a “constant heaviness” that’s been weighing on her. Recently, I tried suggesting therapy for her, hoping it would help her process her emotions and also improve our relationship, but she was really triggered by that and didn’t want to talk about it anymore. She says she doesn’t feel like talking to anyone about it right now because she feels judged, like she’s not doing enough, and it’s really affecting her self-esteem. She says she’s trying her best to deal with everything on her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sexual disconnection has also affected my emotional well-being. I have a very high sex drive, and when my needs aren’t being met, I feel unfulfilled and frustrated. Over time, I’ve started to feel resentful, and I even catch myself feeling attracted to other women. I feel like I’m trying to be patient and understanding because I love her and I know she’s going through a tough time, but I also feel like I’m losing a sense of myself in this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she moved out again to her home as she looks for jobs, and now we’re back to long-distance. She’s still feeling down about being rejected from job opportunities, which is adding to her sadness. The emotional distance and lack of intimacy have only worsened, and I’m finding it harder to manage my frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really love her and want to support her, but I’m struggling to balance my own emotional needs and desires with her needs. I feel drained and unsure of what to do. I’ve been patient, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m being too patient and should just move on. How do I approach this situation, especially considering how she’s struggling with depression? Is it selfish of me to want more intimacy, or am I just being realistic? How do I communicate my needs without making her feel worse?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "Been in a relationship for 1.5 years with my girlfriend, but the emotional and sexual connection has faded, especially after we moved in together. She’s been dealing with depression and feelings of inadequacy, which has made her withdraw emotionally and sexually. I’ve tried being patient and supportive, but I’m struggling with unmet needs and emotional exhaustion. Now she’s moved out again, and I’m wondering if I should stay patient or move on. How do I communicate my frustrations without adding more stress for her?\n",

      "Body text: My friend (29f) and I (30f) were supposed to go out and celebrate my birthday on a Friday, and on Saturday she was supposed to help me move out of my place because I was traveling home Saturday night (on short notice) and was not going to be back until after my lease end date. She had also told me I could leave some of my stuff at her place (i.e. the things I'm not supposed to put in a storage unit) and stay with her when I return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[For context, she's from the city we live in, I am from another country/continent. We have known each other for five years and she's one of my best friends. We met at work and after some job changes, we now work on the same team again although not directly together. We've helped each other a lot. Earlier this year, she was going through a breakup and needed more company and support so we were together a lot; before that, I moved last year and she helped me, we also are each other's wingwoman.\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "On that Fri, she messaged me at 5pm to ask if going out at 8pm is fine, and I said yes. After some texting about what we were going to wear and postponing to about 8:30, she vanished. At 10pm, I checked in on her and she replied instantly that she was at another event and is 20 minutes away from me. Forty minutes later, I suggested we rain check - I was already annoyed and had a busy day coming up with the move and trip. At 11:20pm, she showed up to my place - with a cake, a $130 Swarowski gift (only know that because she left the receipt in the bag), and really drunk. Despite her condition, she asked several times what time I would need her help moving the next day - and she insisted we go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we did go out, the security at the bar didn't let my friend go in because she had had too much to drink. I was almost relieved, we walked around for a bit by a few other clubs and bars and I called her an Uber. She refused to go in, we made a bit of a scene, she said she wanted to celebrate me and help me to which I replied that she was too drunk to do either. Then I left and went home. I would have had a much more fun night if I had gone out alone earlier in the night, or if I had stayed in. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I moved most of my stuff to storage and got another friend to help store some things for me. I cried a few times throughout the day, I was so hurt from how she treated me. At 3pm, I checked in on her, per my mom's advice. She said she's \"so sorry we could not go out for drinks yesterday\" and asked how she could help me move \"once I get some food in me\". I told her I was almost done and wished her a speedy recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "She never replied. Didn't make a sober apology. Didn't check in on me, ask when I was traveling back, or ask where I was staying. (I stayed at an Airbnb for 2 nights and it was totally fine, the point isn't free housing here.) The first day I was back in the office, we did not exchange any words or looks. The second day, we bumped into each other in the bathroom and she asked me if I had had lunch yet (I had). \n",
      "\n",
      "Do I return the birthday gift to her? I don't think it's right to keep it when we don't even talk any more. I don't even wear jewelry - maybe she'll enjoy the necklace more than me, and maybe she'll realize she's hurt me. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the second time she gets too drunk to follow through on our plans, the first time we were supposed to meet at a park to have a beer before going to a dance party, but by the time I met her, she had pre-drunk so much she could barely get into her Uber. Another thing that happened that night is that I mentioned we should plan the May trip we had been talking about, and she said she's trying to arrange a trip with another friend to Nashville and that she can't commit to our trip. At that point, I was so disappointed that this wasn't my main concern but it also felt dismissive.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: Friend of five years showed up too drunk the night we were supposed to celebrate my birthday, and the day before she was supposed to help me move. She did not apologize other than a \"sorry we couldn't drink\" and we have not talked since, other than a minor small talk exchange in the office. I think it's right to give her the birthday gift she got me back\n",

This is when I got sick… I had to stop him in the middle of our conversation and went to the bathroom to throw up. I threw up all over the toilet seat (seat was covered kms) as well partially on to the floor and into the toilet. I cleaned it up as best as I could and went back to his room to finish our chat. I had to pause him again in the conversation and throw up again. By this time it was 4am.\n",

      "While we were chatting we did kiss a bit but it lead to nothing. I probably tasted like throw up AHHHH. I called and Uber because he said it was 4am and I thought that was my que. He walked me out and I said “this was not how I thought it was going to go” or something along those lines. He said that he didn’t know and that he was a bit stupid (he was talking about getting cues I assume). I kissed him said that he wasn’t stupid and maybe next time the got into the uber.\n",

I then around 3pm I texted again with “I’m going to xxx location to pick up my car if you wanna get food and finish our conversation”?

      "Body text: Okay so I (15M) have been dating my girlfriend (14F) that goes to a different school to me for 5 months. We both go to the same organisation that allows us to meet twice a week and sometimes more if we have a scheduled event. At this organisation, there is another guy (16M). My girlfriend is quite close with him, and she spends lots of time alone with him. They're always asking each other if they're okay and stuff, wheras sometimes she gets mad at me for what seems like just me having feelings. Bearing in mind I am neurodivergent and struggle to recognise or control emotions. Those two are neurotypical. Anyway, they're really close and he always takes her into rooms alone and stuff because he notices her about to cry and I always see the two alone just looking at a phone and laughing when I am working hard to supervise alone (we are all in charge of a large group of people). They are really touchy, and often spend time alone together laughing, not supervising, etc. She never does that with me. This guy also has a pretty bad reputation for trying to have sexual relationships with people much younger than him or begging others for sex. I'm just really jealous and kind of angry that those two are always just off together doing whatever and laughing or being touchy and its to the point that I get annoyed or even uncomfortable. Should I tell her or am I being an asshole?\n",

From the start, I’ve been open about my feelings around sex and porn — I even watch it myself, especially during the times when our sex life felt lacking. Sometimes we’d go a whole month without being intimate, mostly because he said he was too tired from work. Still, we had plenty of conversations about intimacy, and he never once mentioned watching porn.\n",

      "Recently, I found out that not only has he been watching porn, but he’s also been checking girls' NSFW profiles. When I confronted him, he said he only checked those profiles to see if they had actual intercourse videos, and if not, he’d leave. Honestly, I find that hard to believe. What hurts more is that I was always the one initiating things in our relationship — emotionally and physically — and over time, I started feeling rejected, insecure, and confused about my worth. He was also rude and defensive when I tried to talk about these things.\n",

      "I wanted to break up because i was terribly hurt too, and beyond, emotionally exhausted, didn't have hope, or anything left, just tired of fixing and being in the cycle of hurting and getting hurt. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will agree that there is alot of work to be done, in matters of communication, patience, behaviour and feelings, but just for starters i would like to talk about my feelings. I agreed to be in the relationship whole hearted because i felt good when she heard me, understood me and apologised to me that night when we were going to break up , i felt that if we can really do this, understand each other, maybe there's no need to break up. My feelings were withdrawn but they came out a little bit when she listened and understood me.   \n",
      "But some things have not changed, and for that i need some advice. I feel for a very long time, just dragging myself around, my individual life is crap, i feel horrible and useless, low self esteem, and I'm not just being able to devote myself to something, to work or anything. I was, going somewhere, but fights in the relationship, problems that i myself faced dragged me down and down.   \n",
      "  \n",
      "I dont feel like talking to her, i dont feel good with her like I used to, i dont feel natural i dont feel the innocence of the relationship as i used to do. That fun, is there, but not wholehearted, its hard to  describe but everything feels like a chore, its like a void within me that has been created and its soiling everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its like the spark is lost, i do feel attracted to her, and she is good, but that appreciation of character, that respect, that value of the person, its like, all of it has faded. That authenticity that i used to feel is like robbed off from me. The reason is the shit that we have been through, every month we have fought with each other. I have improved, she has too, but i guess if we wanna move forward and feel like before again, we gotta understand things and work for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "What can i do , to feel like i used to again, want her again, see her like i used to? So that everything doesnt feel like a chore. \n",

      "Title: Should I (24f) leave my situationship (24f)\n",
      "Body text: i (f24) have been seeing my ex (f24) for the past few weeks and am at a real crossroads here. We had previously dated a few years ago and ultimately my ex cheated. My ex married the woman (23f) and would sporadically initiate contact but I would typically not play into the “I miss you” conversations. My ex and I came into contact in August of last year and maintained a platonic relationship for a few months, keep in mind this was via text because my ex moved to a different state. My ex came to visit in January and confessed feelings for me still and a willingness to leave her wife which I brushed off by saying you're married, you made the choice already essentially. My ex decided to move back to the area to pursue a job but came alone, telling me she was pursing a separation from her wife and not because of me but because she didn't want to be with her. We continued as friends occasionally seeing eachother. Our relationship changed as we seen each other more in person and we are now dating. i ended up going through her phone to see that she was still maintaining the relationship with her wife, and a week later she went back to tell her everything and start the process of divorce. Through this whole situation she hasn't been completely honest with me or the woman she's divorcing, but seems very committed to trying to make something work with me. i at this point feel a level of guilt for contributing to cheating, even though I wasn't aware of the nature of their relationship at that point. Is it best to give some time to let the dust settle, walk away completely or stick it out? Any input/questions are welcome.\n",

      "Body text: I've been dating my partner for 6 months now. We don't live together and I have my own place (she doesn't).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall she's great, loving, caring, respectful of my space if I need it and we get on really well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has some past trauma in life and anxiety from that, been cheated on in the past and her parents had a messy split when she was younger.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see each other every few days and sometimes we'll see each other for a few days in a row with her staying over. We phone once a day for general talking and catching up with each other and it's nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "However as the relationship has gone on I've noticed some behaviours that scare me a bit. Firstly, it's always me to ask if she's free for a call. I know she wants to call and we've discussed it, she just says she wants to respect my space which I appreciate because she knows I'm more of a loner and quite enjoy my own company.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we're on the call however it becomes exhausting because I can't seem to end the call unless I have a very good reason without her getting sad and 'jokingly' saying things like 'are you breaking up with me' or 'do you not want to be with me', she'll then come off as sad on messages for a bit after that. It's not like I'm giving her a 10 minute call and ending it, quite often I'll be on the phone for 90+ minutes without distraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say I'm going out with friends or whatever she'll get overly sad if I don't message her much and she'll get really really sad if I'm going on a work night out or something, even if we hadn't planned to see each other that day. There have been times where I've been out for the day with a friend where she's been at work but I haven't messaged much. I then had to leave for the evening but could have fit in an hour's phone call with her but she said no because she was too sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have discussed it a small amount and she'd never stop me doing these things and I know that so I'm not concerned there. It just always makes me feel like the bad guy because I don't want to make her sad which is what I'm doing, although  in my eyes it's perfectly reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on what she's said in previous conversations it does feel like she has a fear that I'm just going to get with someone else (I'm really not at all) and she has mentioned that when we leave each other it feels to her that we're breaking up, even when we leave on good terms which we always do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It just becomes a bit exhausting because it makes her sad and I feel like the bad guy. When she's sad she'll just send me one word answers and won't put much effort into messaging. It's fine by me because I don't feel a need to be in constant communication but I also don't want her to feel sad because I feel like I've done it. I've had to start timing our phone calls to within about 60/90 minutes of where I NEED to leave to be somewhere. If I leave the call because we've simply finished with things to talk about and I want to go for a walk, read a book, go cook some food or whatever then her sadness is massive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I write this the more it seems to me that there are some underlying abandonment issues but she has mentioned in the past that she feels like she puts more effort into general communication which is weird to me because I'm always the one asking her for a call (because I know she wants to but wants to respect my space) and I put a lot of thought into messages to make sure that conversation can flow.\n",

      "TLDR: unsure if my partner has underlying abandonment issues. Gets sad if I end phone calls without 'good' reason and gets sad if I do things with other people without her, even if she couldn't make it there anyway. It's becoming exhausting trying to manage her emotions because I always feel like the bad guy. But also aware it could be a difference in expectations around the amount of communication between us. Wondering how to manage it.\n",

      "Body text: I met my girlfriend around 8 months ago now. In all that time she's had a lot of trauma surrounding her relationship with her mom. She was kicked out by her mom after a massive argument between the two of them which my girlfriend can barely remember it was so petty. Since then, her and her mom have gone borderline no contact, and she lives with her dad and step-mom, and has done since we met.\n",

Our therapist encouraged my girlfriend to write a letter to her mom, which I asked if she'd like me to be there for, which she agreed, which ended up being really good for both of us. She cried while writing it, a lot, and I got her to read it out for me, and we hugged.

      "So for context, my bf and I have been together for 4 months. We went to eat last night and were talking about a bunch of controversial topics. We got to a certain topic that we didn’t eye to eye on and it just really baffled me to how close minded he was about it. He noticed I went quiet and asked what was wrong to which I said “That mindset is just not what I would want in a partner”. He was quiet for a bit but I explained that it was more so his reaction to the topic than anything else. We went about the rest of the night normally. Fast forward to two hours later and he drops me off at home but I noticed his goodbye was a bit dry. I texted him after he drove off and asked if he was still bothered by what I said. He said it was jarring to hear me say that and asked why I didn’t mention it again until that moment when I texted him. I told him I wanted to reassure him that it didn’t change the way I felt about him or us and didn’t want him to have doubts about where I stood with him.\n",

      "Body text: We have been dating for 3 years, basically throughout high school, being in the same class together. Starting out as friends and eventually getting together, we have both had our fair share of relationships and flings before and were somewhat experienced when we met. It was great, we live so close to one another so seeing her at school and then after school felt so lucky, but as time goes on I’m beginning to feel tired of it. I enjoy time alone, doing things I enjoy, and so does she, but I just can’t seem to get that time. Constant sleepovers for days at a time even though she’s lives 2 minutes away, majority of my hours I’m not working are spent with her, we even share our friend group. And she often fights with me when I say no to sleepovers, or hangouts or even if we don’t text enough through out the day. If I don’t answer her call while I’m at work, it’s classified as ignoring her. Am I a bad person for wanting alone time, to play games, play on my phone,  watch Tv, play football, just spend a day alone? I get it sometimes, and obviously I still text her and give her a call but it never seems enough. I feel guilt tripped into saying yes to what she wants, and when I say no, it’s usually a fight that ends up with things going her way. She knows what I want but it never seems to change. I just find it unfair as I’ve changed a lot about me to accommodate for her needs, but I don’t feel an equal return from her. And I feel horrible about myself when the thought of leaving her crosses my mind, because I genuinely do love her, but it’s all getting a bit too much, with the fights, the awkward silence after arguments, settling, not getting what I want.\n",

      "Body text: In the beginning of my relationship with my boyfriend we kept things private and didn’t tell people. We began to tell people and told pretty much everyone except his girl best friend. He and her grew up together because the families are close. She has a boyfriend. They would regularly see eachother one on one and in groups. I really wanted him to tell her about us so we could all be friends but he kept putting it off. I noticed he would remove her from being able to see his social media whenever he would post me. There was a time he posted a photo of me on his lap and she responded with “is that you??” And he got really embarrassed and said “I thought she wouldn’t care”. Once when we were in the car she was nearby and he ducked in my car for the entire time to not be seen with me. He went to a party once without me and they ended up sleeping next to eachother. At another party before she knew of me she came up and grabbed him by his arm and just took him away, I left that party upset quickly after that. He also takes so many photos of her when they hangout even if it’s in a group it looks like it was just them. I found a message of him calling her cute on a photo and telling her some other photo is “fire” of her but he says he was just being a “supportive friend”. They would go to the beach, hangout, and paint together without me. He says everything is platonic and he’s just waiting to tell her about me but he didn’t for 4 months. After he did she didn’t make any attempt to meet me and neither did him, she kept inviting him over without me. I feel like as a girl “best friend” she would want to meet me? Anyways I know there’s more stuff I’m leaving out but in the long run after a year of still not meeting her and feeling weird I told him how I felt and he agreed to stop being friends with her and they never really talked again. We’ve ran into her once and she didn’t even look at me and he didn’t introduce me and it all felt so weird and he was very upset at me for getting upset. She’s been the topic of a lot of arguments. \n",
      "Sometimes I feel bad that they aren’t friends because he says I ended a friendship with a good friend of his that was simply platonic because I was insecure. I feel like if it was all platonic then all of this wouldn’t feel weird. It’s been 2 years since they stopped being friends and I feel like it’s a little late to fix anything, and I don’t really want to but I feel guilty sometimes. What can I do? Forget about this?

      "Body text: \n",
      "We've been dating for just under 3 years. Other than this, things are great. We are very similar people in many ways, but the way conflict plays out is horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, and now with more frequency, when angry my boyfriend has said very mean things, often yelling, sometimes so loud that I'm physically intimidated.  These are things he would never say usually if he weren't angry.  As I said, otherwise we're very well matched. \n",
      "\n",
      "These include: I'm not a good person, our relationship is boring because of me, I'm the reason why we fight, I dogpile him, I never let anything go, I look for things to get upset about, I make him feel hopeless, he's unhappy because of me, etc. Over the past 24 hours there's been multiple references to ending the relationship entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've honestly forgotten a few, these are fairly recent, within the past month or so. In the past it's been much more direct critisisms to my character. This in general has been going on for awhile; and some things he's said have stuck with me. He takes accountability, and puts in noticable effort day to day, which I see and appreciate. Obviously though, it keeps happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt that the build up of these instances has made me more emotionally reactive. When one is fairly fresh (and even sometimes when it's not) I air on the side of negative reaction. He says that he constantly feels like he's under a microscope and taking accountability, paying for things over and over. As I said though, they keep happening, and whenever it does it brings everything else back to the surface. Regardless though, I'm not blind to my part in it, and want to learn how to truly process and heal from these things. I need to figure out how to put a bow on it and move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, my perspective is that for the strong majority of these fights, it isn't because I've approached him with a grievance. It's because I have an opinion or perspective that he doesn't like. So, good and bad. I don't nessecarily feel shut down constantly when I bring up things that bother me in the moment, it's more about how I will approach something, or my opinion. He seems to recieve this at the time as an attack (I'm not sure why) and will attack me personally in return. Regardless though, it feels like every point I ever make that doesnt align with his thinking is added to an arsenal of never letting anything go, all I want to do is fight, etc. I'm left feeling like I'm not even safe to share an opinion, much less a grievance. When we revisit the thing that made him angry, we often find that it was simply a difference in opinion or perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the fights when he calms down, he nearly always takes accountability. He's aware when he isn't in the thick of the emotion that it isn't good, and tends to agree with me on most of it. When he is angry though, it's in one ear and out the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's been in some pretty awful relationships in the past. Being cheated on, forced poly, taken financial advantage of, alcoholism on their part, etc. I definitely see a lot of what I would consider 'toxic girl' behaviours, like constantly moving the goal post when angry. When asked he has admitted that shitty relationship after shitty relationship, he has hardened, and is much more focused on defending himself. I don't blame him for that, but I am left feeling like I am paying the price for these shitty women.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, I'm looking for what I can do here. He tells me that I never let things go and draw them out way longer than I should, and I can recognize that. He takes accountability, day to day improves, and he listens to my feelings on these matters. At this point I'm viewing it as akin to deciding to stay with a partner that's cheated. Yes, you can hold them accountable, day to day can improve, you can talk about it, but at the end of the day that person needs to make peace with that their partner cheated and they decided to stay. I feel like thats what I need to do, make peace and try to emotionally deflate. As I'm writing though, I'm realizing that only works in a scenario where the cheating stops. I just want to be able to let things go and be happy again.\n",

      "Title: I (25F) feel invisible whenever I'm with BF'S (24M) family (especially MIL)\n",
      "Body text: A bit of context: I'm a foreigner living in my bf's country; I've been living here for over 5 years, and we both speak the same language. We met 2 years ago and have been dating since, and he's the partner I had always \"wished\" to be with if I ever had one, I feel we are absolutely perfect for each other and love him dearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "His family is well-educated, cordial, polite... for the most part. The first time I met his parents was at an informal, small concert, and after the concert ,his dad (whom I relate to the most) talked to me a lot more and we shared some stories, but his mom refused to make eye-contact with me, didn't ask me anything about myself, and just talked with the person she had beside her the whole entire time. It was an odd first impression for me, since I have always gotten along super well with my ex-partners' parents (even my ex-MIL's). I found this behavior to be a bit rude and strange, but I just ignored it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then everything started making sense. The more time passed and the more I knew them, the more I understood that my BF's mother is what you would call a \"boy mom\"...  She hasn't taught her 2 sons to do anything by themselves, doing it for them instead (cleaning, cooking, paying for things, even scheduling medical appointments) and she takes pride in it. She never lets my bf pay for anything, even if he wants to just do so himself. I also feel that my bf is her favorite conversation topic (this makes my bf uncomfortable), which at first I didn't mind, but it started getting real tiring every single time I visited them, because it could go one of these ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) I say something about myself, like an experience or an achievement, and MIL interrupts me and always \"one-ups\" my thing with something my BF has done\n",
      "\n",
      "2) I say I'm teaching my bf to do something (I'm teaching him russian, I taught him how to paint, etc) and instead of acknowledging this about me, she's LITERALLY said once: \"you've always been such a good student! good on you!!\" basically praising him for learning from me, but not caring about my skills?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) I make a joke about my BF (how he snores, how he's not super orgainzed, something small) and she's like \"What?? My perfect son? I've never heard him snore! He's gotten more organized over time!!\" basically he can never have anything \"wrong\" or \"flaws\", it gets debunked immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that between this dynamic AND not being asked anything about myself, despite it being TWO years already, I am going crazy. For the last couple of months I've felt minimized and invisible; despite having so much to tell, such as my journey coming here from my 3rd world country, all the struggles I've had to endure, the fact I speak 4 languages, my skills in art and music, I feel like she just doesn't care if it doesn't have anything to do with her son. It hurts me a bit because of two reasons: 1) my ex-in-laws were absolutely lovely with me even until the very end, and this contrast is abysmal and 2) I live in a different continent from my parents. BF has never met them and probably won't be able to in a loooong time, due the president (semi-dictator) basically land-locking them and the political issues in the country not allowing me to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel all of this affects me mostly because of point no. 2; I just feel so excluded when I'm around them, as though my worth as a human is invisible. My BF has always tried to include me, but his mother always manages to change the topic and redirect it back to him, his brother, or herself. They are \"nice\" to me in the sense that they are polite asking about my week or my day, but it doesn't go beyond that. My FIL does ask me more, but only when MIL isn't around to interrupt lol. If she's there, you know the converersation will go another way. I am starting to resent her and started going less to the outings she's invited me to. BF and I live together now and not far away from them, they're also very traditional and do lots of family gatherings frequently, and I stopped going to most because I feel even more lonely than what I already do living abroad. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "A few days ago I was \"forced\" to go to a Mother's Day gathering. MIL texted me saying to not make any plans for May 4, as she wanted to celebrate the day with the family, and since she knows my mother doesn't live here, she assumed I would go either way. I absolutely didn't want to but I feel I didn't have an excuse, didn't think fast enough, and just saying \"I'd rather stay alone today\" felt too aggressive (I'm also a bit of a coward). I had a terrible day, as always, and felt like crying afterwards. It was all my BF, his job, and then started talking about their jobs (they're lawyers) using specialized law terminology I'm not familiar with at all, making it impossible for me to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "My BF understands how I feel and said he wanted to have a calm conversation with his mother, explaining to her how I feel in order to reach a solution for this. I'm a bit scared about this, because MIL has zero self-awareness and zero emotional maturity, I feel she will go passive-aggressive on both of us and give us the cold shoulder (she does this when she's upset). My BF said that sometimes conflict is the only way to shake things up and change dynamics. I hate confrontation and am grateful he's doing this for me, but I'm just a bit scared about everything. Do you think this is a good idea, or should I just continue with my original plan of not going to the events?\n",

      "  \n",
      "**TL;DR:** I’ve been living in my boyfriend’s country for over five years, and we’ve been together for two. Despite bing polite, his mother has consistently made me feel invisible—she rarely shows interest in me, constantly redirects conversations to her son, and downplays my presence. It’s been especially hard since I’m far from my own family due to political reasons, and used to have very warm relationships with ex-in-laws. I’ve started avoiding family gatherings because they make me feel worse. After a tough Mother’s Day event, my boyfriend offered to talk to his mom about how I feel. I appreciate it, but I’m nervous about her likely passive-aggressive reaction and unsure if it’s better to have that conversation or keep my distance.\n",

      "Title: How to improve my (32F) relationship with (39F) after 10 years?\n",
      "Body text: I have been with my girlfriend of almost 10 years, and we have been through a lot together. Long distance, being \"open\", and a year long break up. My family is religious and we have overcome that, and they love her now. Everyone loves her and I have worked extremely hard to incorporate her back into my life after our break up. On the outside things are smooth, and we communicate very well. We have productive fights that do not last for days like they did when we broke up. We both grew from therapy, and she has been correcting a hormone imbalance that greatly impacted her mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in a year I think we have had sex 3 times. Is this normal? I don't know if it is just a dry spell anymore. I know being in a long term relationship means many phases, but we have always lacked frequency in this department, hence keeping the relationship open to satisfy my needs. I am concerned about marrying her when it feels like physical intimacy is totally missing. Plus there is frequently tension. I grew up in a different environment than she did, so I constantly feel on edge like we are fighting, but it's just a normal day for her. I am missing \"joy\" and light-heartedness. Everything feels like a big deal, and I have anxiety if I don't clean up or if I make a mistake or a wrong turn driving that she will make rude snide remarks that undercut me. And to me, it's not a big deal to forget something on the grocery list because we're all human, but she cannot deal with it in a healthy way. Small things literally set her off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;dr There's so much good in the relationship, and love and care. Truly good times. But I worry about our compatibility when I find her to be unnecessarily harsh when a situation does not call for it.. but I was also raised differently. So am I supposed to accept my feelings will just always be hurt? And just actively work on physical intimacy? Not sure what to do. Are other couples going through similar things?\n",

      "Title: Boyfriend isn’t very thoughtful and it’s making me feel resentful/unloved. How can I ask him to be more thoughtful?\n",
      "Body text: My 26F boyfriend 28M and I have been together for 1.5 years. I love him very much. We are completely aligned in our worldviews, values, ideologies, interests, aspirations, lifestyles, intellect, senses of humor, desires, the works. I see a long term future with him, and we have discussed the idea of getting married down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he is not a particularly thoughtful person. He’s kind, he’s communicative, he’s respectful, he’s trustworthy, he’s an excellent listener, he’s patient, he’s affectionate, but he doesn’t really go out of his way to make me feel special. I, on the other hand, am constantly thinking about him and coming up with surprises/small gestures to make him feel loved. I regularly pick up his favorite snacks at the grocery store, I get him flowers just because, if he’s running out of a hygiene item I notice and get him a new one, if he mentions he likes something I remember and surprise him with it later on, I regularly give him massages when he’s had a long day, I plan all kinds of different dates and activities for us, I cook him/us dinner, I surprise him with his favorite homemade desserts, I buy treats for his pets, I bring him back little things that made me think of him when I go on trips, I leave little love notes on his fridge or the bathroom mirror, when I’m at his apartment I will take out the trash/do dishes/laundry/etc if I notice it needs to be done (without being asked), I routinely pay for things for him just to be nice, I make or bring him coffee in the morning, I keep a list in my notes app of all the things he likes/gift ideas for him, I regularly compliment him and tell him everything I love about him in very specific detail, not just “I love you” but the specific physical, emotional, and intellectual things about him that I love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, he doesn’t reciprocate this behavior. He has never been the one to plan a date for us. We cook together but he has never cooked for me before like I have for him. He has brought me flowers very occasionally for a birthday or anniversary, but never just because like I do for him. He has never given me a massage. He has never surprised me with a little gift just because he thought I would like it. He doesn’t bring home my favorite snacks from the store. He has never planned a surprise for me. He’s never done anything for my pets. He doesn’t write me love notes or cards. He tells me he loves me all the time, but never goes into detail about the specifics. He calls me beautiful occasionally, but I compliment him every day. One time he did the dishes for me while I was at work, and I told him how incredibly touched I was and how it made me feel so loved and meant so much to me. When his family does something nice for me/us, I hand write them a thank you note. When my family does something nice for him, I have to remind him to say thank you to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This imbalance of thoughtfulness is starting to hurt me and make me feel resentful. I don’t want our relationship to become transactional, but I feel like if he wanted to put the effort in he would. The little things matter to me, and they add up. I love him so much that I can’t help but think about him all the time, and it hurts me that the same isn’t true for him. About 6 months ago I was feeling the same way, and I cried and told him how I felt and that I wanted him to be more thoughtful. He was really receptive to the conversation and not defensive at all which was great, but in 6 months not a lot has changed. I feel like I need to talk to him again and ask for what I need, but I’m struggling to trust that he will make more of an effort. He regularly tells me that the things that I do “make him feel so loved” and that he wants to “get on my level and match my energy”, but behaviorally not much has changed. For context, I should probably mention that I have been in several serious relationships prior to this one, but I am his first serious relationship. I know he’s not as practiced with these things. But I also don’t think it’s that hard to learn or make an effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also don’t want to sound ungrateful for the wonderful things he does do for me. He tells me he loves me every day, and I know that he does. I love that he texts me good morning every morning. I love that he’s not afraid to be affectionate with me in public. I love that he listens well and is patient and gentle with my emotions and anxiety. I love that he is very dependable and shows up for me when I need him. I am very appreciative of all the nice things he does do for me, but I also have somewhat come to expect them as bare minimum behavior in a serious, healthy, adult relationship. I’m wondering if I’m asking for too much, but at the same time, everything I want him to do for me are things that I am already doing for him. Any advice is welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR I am much more thoughtful than my boyfriend when it comes to small gestures of love. The imbalance is starting to make me feel hurt and resentful. I’ve already asked him once for more, but not a lot changed. How can I get him to be more thoughtful without making him feel like a bad partner?\n",

      "Body text: I (27F) am thinking about leaving my boyfriend (26M) but am scared since we share a 1 year old and I myself come from a broken home with separated parents and don’t want to do the same to my daughter. There’s a lot of contributing factors to why I feel I should leave and events that have occurred to contribute to our broken relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize in advance as this is gonna be a really long story…\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, my boyfriend cheated on me and went behind my back since early on when we first started dating. I found out he had cheated on me when he admitted it to be after almost 7 months of dating. As this was my first relationship, of course this was devastating to me and took a huge toll on my self esteem and now in retrospect, I feel I only stayed in the relationship at the time because I didn’t want to feel like I was “losing” since I was almost certain my boyfriend would go back to seeing the girl he cheated on me with if I broke up with him. As far as I know he didn’t cheat on me again after admitting it to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the next year after we’ve been together for 1 year and 5 months, I broke up with him as I had some religious convictions and was just deeply dissatisfied with our relationship. He was constantly looking at provocative pictures or videos of girls on Instagram or TikTok behind my back and denying it, which caused even more damage to my self esteem and trust in him. I should also mention that my bf had just gotten out of an extremely toxic 3 year relationship with his ex around the time when we first met. He was really toxic and due to my poor boundaries and own trauma from childhood I unfortunately accepted his poor treatment and was always hopeful things would get better and he would change.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was devastated when we broke up and cried in my arms and I of course was heartbroken too but I just couldn’t take feeling so unhappy and worthless anymore. We continued to see each other on and off for some months until eventually deciding to get back together and 1 month later I end up finding out I’m pregnant but by this point our relationship is so damaged because of my boyfriends controlling behaviour at the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I obviously had a lot of issues I had to work on myself and on top of feeling religious guilt now for getting pregnant outside of marriage, I often did not want to have sex with my bf but would do it anyway which would lead to my bf feeling rejected and not desired and he asked for a break. I asked him if he would be seeing other people during this time which he repeatedly denied and then ended up hooking up with a girl he met on tinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was of course extremely devastated and so angry and resentful. It was a mix of so many emotions because I never even knew if I wanted to have children and now I felt I was stuck in a position I never wanted to be in because of my poor decisions and poor choice in romantic partner. He was emotionally abusive often in our relationship too so it just seemed like I was in a nightmare having a child with someone like him. \n",
      "\n",
      "My sadness and loneliness led to even more poor decisions and after a month of being broken up with my boyfriend, I reached out to a guy I used to hook up with before I got into a relationship. At first I just messaged bc I was lonely but then the conversation led to more and we had planned to meet up to hook up. He did not know I was pregnant. I was afraid and hesitant and knew what I was thinking of doing was wrong and thankfully it never happened and I never sought out any other opportunities to hook up with anyone else. I felt so ashamed I even thought about doing such a thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "After being alone for 3 months and starting to let go of the anger I felt towards my boyfriend I finally spoke to him again as I didn’t want to bring my child into the world where I was in such a tense situation with the child’s father. We decided to try again and as I wanted to be transparent with what had happened during the time we were broken up I told him about me reaching out to this guy because I knew it would be something that he would be upset about and I didn’t want to lie. He of course was extremely angry and upset with me for even considering having sex with another man while our child is inside of me. He judged me very harshly for this and while I know it is a very questionable thing to even think of doing, I know part of his judgement also comes from his cultural expectations where women have to be saints while men can go and stick their dick in everything and anything. At the end of the day, neither him or I were perfect to be pointing the finger at the other acting all self-righteous. \n",
      "\n",
      "He eventually decided to stay and work things out with me but has since struggled with the resentment of this issue and letting it go. Since our baby was born, I have seen him change and grow a lot. I also started going to therapy as I was really struggling postpartum with constant intrusive thoughts about him cheating on me and leaving me while I was pregnant. I was really struggling mentally and on the verge of a mental breakdown honestly. Therapy has changed my life and I no longer think or am affected by the memory of my partner cheating. I can really say I feel confident in myself again and have fully forgiven my partner for the past and have worked on my own personal issues so I can be a better person and parent. \n",
      "\n",
      "We of course still have our relationship issues and my bf still struggles with resentment. Marriage is very important to me and I have expressed this to my boyfriend. At this point we have been together for almost 4 years. He says he is okay to marry me but does not want to have even a small public ceremony with family and some friends bc he cannot get over the thought of me wanting to have sex with another person while I was pregnant. He knows I am a great mother and he says he wants to stay in the relationship and will do a simple courthouse marriage. This is an issue for me bc I don’t want to marry a person I feel is ashamed of me for things of the past that now can never change. And I know from my experience in doing therapy that there isn’t anything I can do to change my boyfriends feelings or reassure him and he has to do the work himself to be able to move past this. This has pushed me to a point where I feel like I should leave the relationship instead of waiting and hoping one day he’ll change his mind and will want to publicly claim me as his wife. I know my boyfriends behaviour has been unacceptable at times and he can still at times hold toxic beliefs but he has grown so much and has shown willingness to hear me out and understand the hurtful things he does. Should I just cut my losses and leave? I want to model what a healthy relationship and version of love is for our child and I don’t want my child to believe love has to be earned.\n",

      "Body text: I (18M) and one of my best friends (18M) have always had a really intense relationship since we met three years ago. We do everything together (I know, not always a good thing, and recently I’ve tried to moderate it). We are incredibly similar in almost every way, but I am very emotionally sensitive while he has a hard time centering and empathizing with other peoples’ problems. Until around a year ago, I had severe clinical depression. VERY long story short, I was a TERRIBLE friend to him and my other friends, and they told me not to speak to them anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went through a lot of therapy, finding myself, etc. and have been essentially recovered for a solid 5 months now. 2 months ago my friend and I started speaking again. It was truly wonderful. We both confessed to having missed each other very much, no hard feelings, just moving forward. We started doing everything together like we used to. I was even more happy than I already had been. He seemed happy too. A sampling of things he has said to me in the past month:\n",

      "I thought things were going great. This week we started bickering (about VERY minor things) a bit more than usual. I tried to talk things through, but that just seemed to make it worse cause he wouldn’t engage. So I decided to just let it go, no big deal, every friendship has moments of slight tension. Especially with our history. We just needed to work through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got into a minor argument yesterday because I thought he seemed like he was in a bad mood (I now know this was because he had a problem with me) and he denied it and said I didn’t understand him or his emotions. I was irked, so I asked him to call me when he got home so we could talk it out and all over the phone. He did so. Immediately he opened the conversation with “I don’t think this is working” and went on to say that we shouldn’t be friends. He said he thought we were fundamentally incompatible and didn’t understand each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, this came out of absolute nowhere. I thought we had been having a sort of rough week but who cares, he had never expressed ANY sort of major issue with me since we became friends, and in fact had showered me with affection until this week. I tried to have a conversation with him about how we could work on our friendship but he wouldn’t budge, he had made up his mind unilaterally and just cut me off. He said he just didn’t care about me anymore.\n",

      "\n",
      "I’m in my 20s, as is my sibling. We were both high-achievers in school, but our paths diverged a few years ago. I moved to the U.S. for college at 17, which my family didn’t support financially or emotionally, so I had to hustle: working, studying, figuring out life on my own. I did well in college and landed a decent job, nothing extraordinary, but enough to get by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, my sibling stayed in our home country, picked up coding, and through some family connections, landed a great job as a software developer. He makes 4x more than I do. Fast forward to now-this year I applied to a few grad schools and I got into a couple Ivy League programs with fellowships. But I’d still need some financial support to make it work. When I brought this up to my family, they gave me the silent treatment. Just nothing. So I had to accept an offer from a less-known program that’s fully funded but honestly won’t add much value to my career, beyond the degree itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, my sibling applied to a top-tier (won't say the name but T3) grad school and asked me to write all his application materials—resume, statement of purpose, recommendation letter drafts, everything. He didn’t even write his name on them; I did it all. And now he just got in—and my family is fully backing him financially, saying the ROI is worth it since he’s in tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I feel… I don’t know, hollow. I’m not proud of how jealous I feel, or how bitter this has made me. It feels like I helped build someone else’s future while compromising mine. And it hurts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still love my sibling, but this situation has made it really hard to feel good about myself, or them, or even my family right now. If anyone has advice on how to not let this jealousy eat away at me, I’d really appreciate it.\n",

Now they’re paying for his program because he’s in tech, and I’m stuck in a less valuable one. I feel jealous and resentful, and I hate feeling this way.\n",

      "Body text: So my girlfriend(16F) started roasting me(16M) about how I look with our \"friends\" at school last year, before we even got together. I’d catch them laughing and making fun of my face a few times. Then when we started dating, she jumped in on it too, she’d laugh at their jokes about me and even throw in her own. Last summer, on a date, she started snapping pics of my forehead (it’s kinda big, I guess) while cracking up. Months later, she admitted she’s got this group chat with her friends where she makes fun of people, including me, so I’m pretty sure she sent those pics there. This year, I’d had enough and called her out on it. At first, she acted like she got it, but not even a week later, she was back at it bringing up stuff I said during our talk and laughing at me. She’s still doing it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s messed me up, man. She’s given me all these new insecurities, especially when she’s out here staring at other guys outside school (even when we’re hugging or whatever). I know you can’t stop people from looking, but it’s always the same dudes, and I’m 100% sure she’d flip out if I did that. Lately, she’s stopped with the verbal mocking and started doing it with looks, she’ll stare at something I’m insecure about while I’m talking to her, trying not to laugh. I’m pretty sure she’s still clowning me behind my back with her friends too.\n",

      "Body text: Background: Me (25F, from Singapore); him(21M, from Austria); we met a couple of weeks ago via Tinder. He's still studying and I'm working already. We live in two cities that are 4hrs away by train. We hit it off really well, good chemistry, fun conversations, lots in common. \n",

I’ve found myself wanting to talk about exclusivity next time i see him—not necessarily anything super long-term, but just knowing we’re focused on each other while this is growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem? He’s quite laid-back and very chill guy. He doesn’t plan ahead, he’s a go-with-the-flow kind of guy, and I worry that bringing up exclusivity might scare him off—or make him feel pressured when I just want clarity. I’m not expecting serious right away, but I also don’t want to pretend I’m fine with being just-an-option when I know I’m not.

      "Body text: So my 23F girlfriend and I 21M have been together for about 7 months (But we’ve dated in the past for a year.) it hasn’t been until recently that she’s been pushing me away and saying things that hurt. Like how all the things that I’ve enjoyed with her she never enjoyed and how she didn’t mean it when she said she loved me for the first time and just wanted to hear me say I love you to her. And it’s starting to get to my head. To add context her and I started dating around may 2023 and it was a great start to the relationship. We had a lot of great sex, were hanging out every weekend, going to places and events, and overall just deeply into each other. It wasn’t until may-June 2024 when things fell apart. She went to rehab and it was hard to support her. Every phone call only left me with a pulling feeling in my chest and made me lose my appetite. Then to make matters worse she broke up with me because she needed to “focus on herself”. I put this in quotation marks because of what I’m about to say later. But anyways her environment was really stressing me out because of how much drama and toxicity was lingering in the air 24/7 and I had to be on the phone to hear it all. And I stuck by her side through all of that. Never thought about even sneaking off or leaving for another woman regardless of how hard our relationship was. But in the end I regret it all. On December 2024 I had went through her phone while she was asleep and I had found messages from another dude while we were broken up. Now you might be thinking to yourself why does that matter if you guys were already broken up.?This is why it matters, we were still friends and I asked her if she had eyes and wanted anyone else and she told me no. She stuck with that alibi until she got caught. That ruined our relationship. Because now all I get is the cold shoulder and her saying hurtful things. I want to leave her but it’s like I can’t. Idk why, I wish I could just walk away from her and stop watering this dead plant. I deserve so much better. I just need advice or an outside perspective from somebody who’s been through the same or similar. Anything helps thank you \n",

      "\n",
      "We've (26F and 24M) been seeing each other for about 3 months. We feel as if we are each other's best friends. Like any other relationship, there are ups and downs, but we are able to work through it. We've also met each other's friends, family, and spend time with each other for a few days nearly every week at one of our parent's home. I work a job that pays near minimum wage trying to save up to go back to graduate school hopefully in the next year. She is currently unemployed due to her being diagnosed with something disabling that leaves her partially blind, fatigued and in pain consistently, but hopes to get back into school for her masters/work in the next few years. At the time of meeting her she told me her conditions/disabilities, so this wasn't something that just appeared in the middle of the relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this past week, she's been telling me she wants to move the relationship to a casual situationship. She voiced that every time we hang out she tries to move around and get things done, but recently it has been affecting her mentally and physically making her feel like she is never doing enough. She feels that I could find a much better partner who can do the things I want and doesn't have as many struggles as she does. Since the start of the relationship, she has been very accommodating of me and was able to put up a front making her seem ok/normal. I thought I was accommodating her well and didn't know that this was affecting her this badly until she told me that it takes a lot of energy out of her whenever we go outside the house. After hearing this, I was sadden and told her that I'm willing to work around how she really feels and accommodate her and her disability. As much as I want her to be able to do things with me, I feel that I am pushing her to her limits too much? The things we are doing are not very physically demanding. Mostly just walking around town, shopping or small activities like going to the beach or concerts. Am I doing the right thing here by trying to re-accommodate to her true self and stay with her or should we move the relationship to a casual situationship so that it doesn't take such a mental toll on her? This whole situation is very confusing to me as this is my first relationship and I have no idea how to navigate it at the moment. Some advice would be helpful!\n",

Despite therapy and efforts to improve, the cycle of fighting and apologizing kept repeating. Things worsened, and I emotionally broke down, even self-harming.

      "\n",
      "Eventually, I started therapy. I learned my reactions were tied to childhood issues, growing up feeling unloved made me crave emotional security in relationships. When I felt misunderstood or threatened, I lashed out. Therapy helped me manage my anger and respond better. Despite improvements, a painful cycle repeated: I’d hurt her, she’d retaliate, we’d both apologize, and I’d promise to change. I worked hard on myself each time, but I always seemed to mess up again. I rarely asked for apologies, believing I didn't deserve them. That created a sense of unfairness within me. I’ve tried so hard to grow and be better, but the hurt we’ve caused each other still weighs heavy, especially the pain I caused her. I’m not proud of it. Maybe I did deserve some of what came back, but it still breaks me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October, few days before prom night, I hurt her again. I was angry, blaming her for ruining my life and feeling the relationship was unfair. I shouted at her for two hours on the phone, and she was devastated. I apologized a lot afterward, realizing my mistakes and stayed by her side. I proposed to her at prom, but she wasn’t as happy as I thought because of everything going on. On prom night I was half an hour late because she asked me to change my shirt last minute and I got stuck in traffic. When I arrived, she was furious and no matter how much I tried to calm her, nothing worked. She said hurtful things, including that I shouldn’t live, called me ma\\* child , and hurt me using her nails in frustration . Later, she calmed down and apologized. I tried to move on, but that night still bothers me. I kept working on myself with therapy, and while things improved, I still hurt her when we fought. I’d apologize, feel like the bad guy, and stop her from apologizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "By January, things seemed okay on the outside, but inside I felt disconnected. I was still hurt by past words and constantly pushing myself to keep her happy. Mid-month, I hit a breaking point, I cried at night, self-harmed twice, and felt completely drained. After a fight where I was wrongly accused, I snapped, yelled, and broke down emotionally. We made up, like always, but this time I truly wanted to end it. I was exhausted, mentally, emotionally, everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "She struggled too. She rarely communicated her feelings until they burst out as anger or resentment. I didn’t explain much and just wanted to leave, which created chaos. She apologized, begged me to stay, that thing still bothers her, and she regrets begging me, those 10 days were hell. I became rude, impatient, angry, and lost all positivity. My words were cruel, and I regret how much I hurt her.\n",

      "It was hard for me to drag myself back up again. But i did.  \n",
      "For three months, February, March, and April, I worked very diligently, trying to be a better person. I took care of myself, took care of her, never got angry, and stayed gentle with her. Every day, I woke up and tried my best, asking her what was wrong, and doing everything I could for her. I felt so much love for her and cried for her, apologizing over and over. She too did what she could, given the state of her mind, and I was grateful for the efforts she made. I tried every day to make her talk, to make her feel better. I took her to places, did everything I could to cheer her up, and every night, I’d ask her what was hurting her. She talked but not so much, twice or thrice she got triggered over me because of past and hurt me badly with her words, but i knew her point, i knew it was okay, so i let it be. She told me i am a despicable person, a m\\*n child, i should not be alive for giving her this much pain, and alot of hurtful things. She said she was feeling suicidal, i listened to her, stayed by her side. She started talking about breaking up, overwhelmed by everything. I stayed calm and gentle, even though it hurt deeply. I didn’t get angry or lash out, not once in those months. But even small mistakes from me would trigger her badly, and it became very hard to handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only one time I got angry, when she emotionally pushed me during a vulnerable moment. She didn’t show care because she was still hurting. That moment brought mutual understanding, but her past words stayed with me: saying she didn’t care about me, that I didn’t deserve an apology, and that even if she moved on, she still wouldn’t say sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "i understood all of it. I knew that me in January had her alot. And after that she was like, never okay or normal. So all my efforts were to make her feel safe with me again, make her feel normal again. I did all that possibly could in these 3 months. Actively thinking about her, doing things for her and talking about things that she had mentioned in the past that hurt her. But it was the same, i was getting hurt inside, and i didnt wanna tell her because i didnt care about small sorries, i wanted that when shes okay, i will ask her and talk with her, because i had seen her mental state very closely and i knew that she doesn't have the patience to listen to me, and i didnt wanted to get hurt anymore trying to communicate. Slowly i was , it was a hit or miss sometimes, but i was still trying to communicate, but not about the big stuff, because i knew she was not in a state to deal with it, and whatever she had said about me, that \" I wont ever listen to you or apologise!\", One more night she said the same thing, and i was so hurt, in shock i ended up harming myself again. All those things stayed with me, and even though she asked me, to talk about what bothered me, i let it be, i was delaying it, so that when she's better i will talk to her about it. In the meantime, it was hurting sometimes but, I was still very happy to be with her, feel so much love for her and be able to take care of her throughout everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April, we argued when I opened up about something that had hurt me, how she had once told me to shut up and stop communicating. I didn’t want to bring it up then, because the timing felt wrong, but she kept asking, so I finally did. She couldn’t handle hearing it and got frustrated when I said, “You haven’t been able to assure me as much as you’ve dismissed me.” She felt attacked and got angry. During that argument, she mentioned suicide, but I was overwhelmed with everything else she was saying and couldn’t focus on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got frustrated too and said something insensitive. The next day, I didn’t address the suicide part first. Instead, I asked for an apology, which made her feel like I didn’t care, and it led to another fight. I later understood and apologised, but by midnight, she was triggered again. She lost control, blaming me for everything, hitting herself, cursing me, saying things like she wished I died, that my parents died. It went on until 4 AM. She said all my efforts meant nothing, that I made mistakes that drove her away even when I tried to communicate. I accepted that I may have failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she kept going, cursing me, threatening to hurt herself if I cut the call. She said I had to stay and let her hurt me because I made her this way. Finally, at 4:20 AM, I cut the call, crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, I went to her place to talk and convince her not to break up. I felt that it was the right thing to do because, despite everything, we still cared for each other. I knew exactly where I went wrong and how much I had hurt her. So, putting all the past aside, I just wanted to stay and work things out. In the end, I managed to convince her to stay. To now, ever since then, i had not been the same, yes i convinced her to be in this relationship, now she is there, a little better, she wants to do good and wants to work on the relationship. But i dont feel the same person as before, all my hope is gone, i dont feel as wholehearted as i used to, and even though if i do even a little bit, doing the fixing seems like Everest to climb. Its alot. I am not the person i was, i cant do it all over again, even though she is there now, i feel shit, and i dont want to go through all that again, all the efforts and listening that i did in Feburary and march. I had a lot of love and hopes and energy. I dont have it in me anymore. But leaving her also hurts, i dont know why. I have dreams and places I want to reach, but right now I’m buried in disappointment, feeling like I’ve let myself down so much that even trying to hope feels fake, like I’m fooling myself, because I’m not who I thought I was, and though I’ve held back from some things just to survive, most of me feels lost, and every attempt to climb out of this just feels like another distraction from the truth of how broken I really am. Currently me and her are on a break, i am trying to be better, so that maybe feelings come back , and the emotional exhaustion fade away. But things are not going well. Last night i harmed myself for no reason.\n",

      "Title: I (19F) feel like my mental problems are dragging my boyfriend (20M) down with me. Is a break the right decision here?\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been together now for nearly 9 months and are long distance (4 hour timezone difference), and as much as I love him I feel like I'll only ruin his life in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some brief context, I struggle from a myriad of mental issues, but the relevant ones here are specifically ADHD and depression (both unmedicated and not in therapy for either for now sadly but that'll be worked on in future once I have the financial means to do so). As a result, I feel I am someone who severely lacks the ability to read the room and register the feelings of others well like how someone more normal would. And this is extending into my relationship and, unfortunately, manifesting as apathy in my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A big issue is that I am always tired. As in, tired enough to fall asleep while sitting upright in the most uncomfortable chair known to man while someone is talking directly to me... I may even have a sleep disorder, who knows, that's not relevant here. I stay up late to talk to him and just end up falling asleep randomly and leaving him talking to a brick wall. It's horrible, and I almost always wake up a few hours later absolutely mortified now that the sleepy haze has worn off to profusely apologise to him, only for him to reassure me and send me back to sleep. I know this hurts him when it happens, and yet he still extends forgiveness to me out of love just like I would do if the roles were reversed with him. He also still extends forgiveness to me even in the aftermath of whenever I've unknowingly mistreated him due to either losing control of my emotions (rare event) or due to how utterly emotionally dense I am to the point where I do things and don't think about how they could be upsetting until the aftermath when he discusses it with me in detail... only for me to apologise and then slip up and unknowingly do it again... and again...\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the cycle here that I'm trying to describe is evident. He loves me, but his love is being wasted considering the state I'm in. He always forgives me for what I do, and I always forgive him whenever the opposite happens. But I seem incapable of taking his forgiveness and using it to better myself for him time and time again, probably as a result of the holes depression has left in my brain and my ability to empathise deeply and take things seriously in a way that's mature and compassionate. We even had an argument over this last night which led me to post here, which comprised of him (understandably) laying into me about what I just don't get about doing what he asks of me to help him. It's hell on earth to be self-aware of how miserable you make someone while simultaneously seemingly not being able to stop it. Almost like watching a car crash take place in slow motion right in front of your own eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where my issue lies. I really, really do love this man, believe it or not. We were friends for a while before we decided to try and become partners, I know him very deeply as he does with me and I will always have fondness for him no matter what. He makes me feel a level of calm, comforting stability and happiness that I cannot thank the world enough for. And honestly? I have the capability of doing the same for him, too, and want to do so more than anything else in the world. I just... can't right now. My ability to be competent is too wrangled in my mental illness at this point, and it will only get worse. I often cry and think about what our bond would be like if we had met at a different time, a time where I was less mentally ill and a better person overall who was capable of loving and nurturing him in the way he needs and deserves. He swears that he'll never leave me over this, but sometimes I wonder if him still being with me is just a sunk cost fallacy-type thing at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, I'm considering taking a break; not breaking up, per se, but more so asking him if it would benefit him if we both stepped back a little and resume our prior friendship, while he has time away from having to deal with my BS and I can take the time to get my ass into gear and actually prepare to be as decent to him as I so desperately wished I was.\n",

      "| (M18) started dating a girl (F18) 6 month ago, and I didn't expect her parents to be so strict to her when we first started dating. She’s really serious about relationships (even teen relationship) and wants it long term, while I want to gain experience first before strong commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "(First 2 month of dating) - we were going out normally, hanging out at my place etc, it was amazing time. But more into the relationship, she started getting more and more limitations from her parents on what she can and can’t do with opposite gender ( she literally can't do anything except talking online, and even online, never date a guy).\n",
      "\n",
      "(3 month of dating) - more limitations from her parents to her, so no more physical contact, barely seeing her irl, it became a miracle to take her on the actual date. We started only talking online and texting each other, calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4 month of dating) - we chose our universities ( while still being in school) and both understood that we won't see each other for 4 more years completely different countries of uni). She was deeply in love with me as im her first bf, but i was always neutral about love from the very beginning because i can only truly love a person if i see the future with her. She said:\n",
      "- \"Oh, im so in love with you, i will wait for you how much it takes, Even if its 4 years\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(5-6 month of dating) - I realized that i cant wait for that long, i have a big s3xual drive ( while she don’t) and i need intimacy from my gf, which i wont get from her in the next 4 years, and i want to experience things as im still young, it's my prime time now. And our relationship overall is just texting and calling each other now, which is more like a friendship than relationship.\n",

      "Also im concerned about how genuine her love is, because my family is way richer than her's and maybe she just sees me as an opportunity to not work in the future, who knows.

      "\n",
      "My question is:\n",
      "•Should I text her to stay as friends and find a person who will give me everything I need or should I wait for 4 years with a hope that everything is going to change? She's nice as a friend to talk to online, but for me it's not a real relationship, and I don't see her as a girlfriend anymore, and I also don't see any future in this relationship, we barely have something that we both interested in, I'm an entrepreneur and run business while she complains that everything is bad in her life and she does nothing to fix it.\n",

      "Body text: It's been exactly two months since my girlfriend(23F) with BPD and I(24M) decided to go on a \"break\" and honestly I need advice because I feel very lost. I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible although the story is long. I'm trying to figure out the best course of action because I want what's best for her. *This post is in no way shape or form an attempt to vent or throw shade at my GF.* I will be discussing issues her and I had, but they are strictly for you guys to ultimately have a better verdict of what I should do going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met my girlfriend my sophomore year of high school when she was a freshman. She was absolutely obsessed with me to the point of stalking me around campus and taking photos of me without my knowledge alongside writing fantasy stories of me loving her. I didn't know that she liked me at the time so we never ended up dating in high school. We reconnected in college and we started to talk almost to the point of getting together, but then she disappeared deleting all media presence. This was heartbreaking and a year would pass until I learned what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "That year I joined the military after college and she appeared on my social media again. We began to rekindle and I discovered she ended up moving states and deleting all her social media/contact info because her ex boyfriend was blackmailing her with nude photos and videos she had made for him. Her parents nearly disowned her because they didn't permit her dating this guy since he was much older and had essentially no future in life. They told her that while she lived under their roof it wouldn't be permissible, so she lied saying she broke up with him but she didn't in reality. This created a very bad dynamic between her family and her with no trust and extreme amounts of enmeshment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward her and I finally start dating and everything was magical during the honeymoon phase. Retrospectively things moved way too fast, but I attributed her obsession with me to the fact she was trying to make up for borrowed time after liking me vehemently for 7 years. At the beginning I was unaware of her having BPD. Later on in the relationship she told me she had an issue with self sabotaging relationships and dissociating, but refused to elaborate. She also told me that she wasn't able to feel empathy for others at the same capacity as most people and she felt like that was the reason she struggled to make friends in life. During our relationship she would snap at me and get filled with rage out of nowhere, which would lead to me being sad and quiet which would make her angrier. Throughout the entire relationship I was very loving and she told me I was even better than what she dreamed of constantly. I surprised her with bouquets of flowers monthly if not biweekly, I did acts of service for her to make her life easier at school, I wrote love letters and paragraphs constantly and I treated her nothing short of a goddess. Things were going well on my end. I never stopped receiving praise from her and appreciation, although she didn't reciprocate much in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing right off the bat that really bothered me was she was lying to her parents about our relationship and my existence. I told her repeatedly I was uncomfortable with this and she was repeating the same mistake she did with her ex and lying about him, but she eventually snapped on me and told me I needed to stop bringing it up so I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a few months later I found out that one of the boys she was talking to over Instagram constantly was an ex boyfriend which really didn't sit well with me. At first I thought he was just a friend until one day I was Facetiming her with her best friend in the room. Her best friend accidentally brought up this boy and talked about how my girlfriend and them dated which I was never told by my gf. In my personal opinion, I don't think you should communicate with people you've dated when you're in a serious new relationship and at the very least she should've notified me about their past. This also irked me because I knew if I did the exact same thing with a prior girlfriend I'd be admonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the relationship I told her very clearly I was heavily Christian and she began mirroring all the things I was saying about my beliefs and values. One thing I made very clear was that I waited until marriage and abstained from sexual contact. She told me she was waiting too which made me happy. A few months later however she'd slip up during a conversation and unintentionally admit to me she wasn't a virgin. I later confronted her about it and she told me she was lying about it for months because she knew I'd be upset. It wasn't the matter of her past that truly bothered me, but rather the lying that really upset me and made it sting. If she had told me from the beginning I would've easily overlooked it, but her lying about it made me really upset. Again its not the actual substance of the issue, but rather the principle of being lied to that hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month later we tried to have a baby together and we spent time together while I was on leave in the military. I slept with her believing we would marry as she promised me a thousand times. During this trip I wanted to meet her parents, but she was still lying about my existence which hurt me a lot. I felt like her parents deserved to know we were trying to get married, but I accepted that I'd have to meet them later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward a week after trying to conceive I find out she texted a different ex that she had slept with in the past. This destroyed my mental health and made me feel horrible, but I stayed and told her that it couldn't happen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every month or two I'd bring up these four lies in hopes that she'd provide me with some amount of reassurance, but every time she'd refuse to take accountability or I'd be met with excuses. This would prolong the pain I felt from these situations and the cycle would continue. Eventually six months later she told me that every time I brought up what she did she felt like a monster, so I stopped bringing it up. She told me to go to therapy because she couldn't help me with getting over it. I later went to therapy and told her that I forgave her for all the things she did and I apologized for being so upset over it. Which in retrospect is kind of crazy. Imagine if I had micro cheated on her, refused to take accountability and then sent her to therapy because I couldn't \"handle\" talking about it anymore. In general, she avoided having hard conversations with me at all costs and would try and pretend like everything was okay. The times she would have conversations with me she'd say how I deserved better, that she was sorry I chose her, that her outbursts on me were unfair and more. Then the next day she'd take it all back and say I knew what I signed up for so being surprised or emotionally whiplashed was dumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "I put up with her outbursts and slight betrayals toward me because I really sympathized with her having this condition and self sabotaging things. A promise was made on my behalf to always love her and I intended and intend to keep it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I was done with therapy and told her that I was finally over it, she began to act incredibly cold and distant. I kept asking her what was wrong and she kept giving me grandiose promises of us being together forever and marrying and that she was happy. During this time she also started to tell me she was worried that I was cheating on her and that she had a major insecurity there. I reassured her that I was staying faithful constantly, but it felt very unexpected and out of nowhere. Even at the time I felt like there was projecting going on and things felt off.\n",
      "\n",
      "She started getting annoyed with everything I did. When she'd call and I'd pick up the phone if I softened my voice too much to be sweet to her she'd yell at me saying she hated when I did that. The next morning she called me and when I answered in my regular voice she told me I sounded too angry at her? Some days she would accuse me of not giving her enough attention and then the next day she'd tell me I was smothering her. I began to get incredibly confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one day I called her and she went off on me telling me how terrible about herself I made her feel and that she felt disgusting because of me and how I used to bring up things. Mind you, the last time I brought these things up were half a year ago. She then started telling me she wasn't good enough for me and all she ever did was hurt me, but I assured her that wasn't true and that I loved her. Then she told me she felt guilty for her inability to communicate as well as I could and that one day I'd wake up 20 years from now and realize I hated her guts. I asked her if she wanted to break up at least ten different times and she said NO every time. I then asked her if she wanted to stay together and she kept giving me really bizarre excuses as to why she didn't want to like how I didn't download a couples app on the Appstore?? She also was super upset I didn't annotate a bible she gave to me, but that was never even discussed. I told her I could do all those things and it was easily fixable, but she told me she didn't want it anymore.... but didn't want to breakup. Finally I posited the idea of a \"break\" and she jumped on that idea quickly saying she needed time to heal from how the conversations about her actions made her feel. I told her that was acceptable and that the one condition was that we weren't allowed to see other people during the break. She told me she \"couldn't ask that of me\" but to trust her that she wasn't looking for anybody else. I thought that was super bizarre, but I let it slip past me. We both said we loved each other and hung up while agreeing to go no contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two days my Instagram feed was flooded by her newly liked reels and photos regarding Fearful/Dismissive Avoidance alongside BPD and most of it seemed very apologetic toward me and how selfish she was etc etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then after two days she began liking tons of posts about how much of a piece of trash I was, how feminine I was, how she deserved better and the relief she felt from the breakup. I was in disbelief even with the knowledge she had BPD. Then she started liking posts that essentially justified cheating and talked about having situationships while you're in a relationship. She began commenting suggestive things under male models Instagram pages which left me heartbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you with BPD or who have extensive knowledge with the disorder, what is my best course of action moving forward? I love her and I want the best for her. I am trying to honestly understand what even happened and I know it may come off as ignorant, but genuinely I need some guidance here. Do I wait this out or should I move on with my life? Will she always be convinced that she hates me deep down inside? Any guidance would be much appreciated.\n",

      "Title: i (18F) feel as if my boyfrined (19M) is being dismissive of me and still has some form of feelings towards our mutual friend (18M).\n",
      "Body text: so about 10 months ago i met this dude online through a mutual friend who i was really close to, and me and him became fast friends. its a bit embarassing to admit, but after about a week of knowing him i caught feelings and eventually confessed after we knew each other for a month. he was hesitant at first but he told me he reciprocated about a few days after my initial confession and it became official. it was mostly fine besides one time where he didnt respond to my texts for about a month (apparently this is normal according to said mutual friend but it still kinda fucked me up) \n",
      "\n",
      "going back to our mutual friend (who ill call simon) he’s been friends with my boyfriend for a LOT longer than i’ve even known the two of them combined, and there’s some messy, weird history between them which i wont delve into for privacys sake… main thing to take away from it though is that my bf used to have feelings for simon but simon didn’t reciprocate.\n",
      "\n",
      "so now onto the present, recently i felt as if my boyfriend was being distant with me, and it always makes me have some sort of mini panic attack because i’m scared he’s going to stop responding to me and eventually just leave me. i confronted him about it and he told me it’s mostly because of his social battery and the fact that he doesn’t really talk to much people in general so he doesn’t know a lot of social skills, which i get esp since he’s autistic (SORRY IF THATS LIKE OFFENSIVE BTW i dont know much about autism…). he said that he’s probably not going to be like this irl which i do believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "but recently, simon made a disc server for friend-making and my boyfriend’s exclusively sending msgs in there rather than the priv server that we usually talk in, and i know he’s talking in there for the sole purpose of talking to simon, since if he wanted to talk to me he would’ve probably just msged me in the priv server (for more claficiation, this kid doesn’t like using dms so he usually just texts in servers that the people he wants to talk to are in). and yes, i know, they’ve been friends for eons compared to me, but i think it’s a little justified for me to be a bit jealous when my boyfriend is asking his friend about a videogame and how far they’ve progressed when i’m literally playing that exact same video game and have expressed far more interest in playing it than simon has.\n",
      "\n",
      "either way, what i want is to confront my boyfriend about this and find some sort of throughline. because its affecting my daily life—i love him so much and we have talked about having a future together plus other corny shit. i genuinely love him and i know he does too. but i dont want to offend him or make him more distant, or make it seem like i'm the only one with problems when he could possibly have some problems as well. i also just want some outside opinions on why he might be acting like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i guess for my conclusion: PLEASE HELP ME. like i said at the beginning, i dont have anyone rlse to talk to this about. usually, whenever im feeling down i talk to simon but obviously i cant talk to him about something that directly relates to him. and my parents do not know im even in a relationship, if they knew i would be buried 10 ft below my home. also, no he is not exclusively attracted to men.\n",

      "Dana had been in several relationships before, totaling over six years. But the issue was that her child’s father was still present in her life. He used to stay at her place even after we became a couple. She said it was because his job was near her house and he always slept in the kid’s room. I didn’t like that and told her. She said, “I know, I’ll do something about it,” and eventually, she told him to stop staying over. He left for another state for work, and our relationship became stronger.\n",

      "Body text: My (F 28) bf (M 27) and I have been dating for almost 2 years. It’s not perfect but it has been probably the healthiest and most meaningful relationship I’ve been in and we both agree we are very happy. Ab 6 months ago the topic of moving in together came up and my boundary on that is I only want to move in with a significant other if we could both potentially see the relationship moving towards marriage. The problem is during that conversation he mentioned he might not want to get married ever. I told him I do, not necessarily soon or even necessarily to him but I had started to think of it as a possibility since we had been so happy and together for a while at this point. We ended on that would be something he’d have to decide on for himself but also for me as it’s important our goals align and this would become an issue at some point in the future if not right now. \n",
      "The other issue is his job. Bc of his job he will have to move sometime in the next couple years meaning that for all intents and purposes we could stay together for 3 more years and then he moves and we break up. I’m starting to get more and more anxious of the fact that this is just a place holder relationship. One to be in until he moves on. \n",
      "None of this is immediate. But I’m not sure at what point it becomes a bigger deal.

      "Body text: Me (23M) and my GF (22F) have been in a relationship for more than 6 years now. We survived the pandemic by staying strong together even if there rough patches here and there, but we stayed unlike others who didn't. But for a while now we are very unstable, each time she finds something that annoys her or a misunderstanding she removes our nicknames, themes, and berates me with some cursing on the side. The problems are like that one time I asked her if she wants to join us to visit my dad's hometown she said \"did you even ask me if too tired to go?\" and proceeded to remove nicknames, themes, a little cursing and gives me the silent treatment in chat... I wasn't even demanding her to go and I informed her about this visit weeks prior. Yesterday night she went out with her friends, drank a little, and went home late, and suddenly I'm the bad guy for asking confirmation. This is one of the many things occuring in our relationship right now, this cycle of removing nicknames, themes, and berating is just too much now that my mental health can't take it anymore.

I have been feeling odd about my reaction as I wasn’t mad at her just more felt disappointed and betrayed as we have a deep deep connection that everyone around us felt. I am not sure what I want to choose to do moving forward but have went no contact to think and refigure out who I am as a person until she reaches out so I can think clearly through what I want when that conversation is to be had. I have thought bout both outcomes one I take her back and mandatorily go to therapy with her to solve these issues and her self sabotaging trauma from her childhood and also my own to solve this and second option I hear the words come from her mouth and find peace in it forgive her but move on. I have been working to get one “win” a day to get my mind back to itself after crying all the tears I have out of me. Is this delusion or is there something else I should be doing.\n",

      "Body text: My gf (f22) and I(f23) have been dating for a couple months now but have been sexual with each other for over a year. It started off as just being friends with benefits wise then turning into situationship and now we are actually together. I have had and are still going through ups and downs with communication mainly because of traumas we have gone through and our toxic cycles but we are working together to get through it and have a lot of hope for each other and our future. One of our struggles right now has to do with intimacy. She needs it to connect, that’s how she feels connected, loved appreciated and seen while I feel I need emotional connection to feel those things. When I mean intimacy, I don’t mean just sex (although she does find connecting and intimate sex super important), it’s more like cuddling, holding each other and rubbing each other, being skin to skin which I totally understand. Our problem is.. I have such bad intimacy problems because of my past and it’s ruining our relationship. Because we started friends with benefits because I was kinda going thru some shit, we did start off having sex but we both knew the sex was just to fill a void/feel good type of thing for each other, not to really intimately connect so it wasn’t there to begin with. I also grew up in a very loveless household. My parents did not show or give any type of affection to neither their kids or each other so it just feels so uncomfortable and foreign to me. I want intimacy but everytime she gets near me in a very close and intimate way, I either disassociate my self out of feeling the connection or tell her to change it cuz i start feeling uncomfortable . It’s come to a point where she feels uncomfortable touching me cuz she doesn’t want to be the person making her partner feel uncomfortable. We have now gone from having sex and comfortably touching and  naked with each other when we were  friends with benefits to BARELY ANY intimacy now that we are in a committed relationship.\n",

Just making facebook accounts, snapchat, etc anyway she could figure it out to message she would. so same thing he would as he put it “entertain her to be an asshole and block her” after that fight it stopped , i mean she kept trying for a good amount of time but he would just block and delete.\n",

We will call them K and T and he does not currently live with them. K and T are messy, have another large dog and just generally aren’t my favorite of his friends. I don’t think they’re the best humans BUT I have also always expressed they are his friends not mine so if he enjoys their company then i support the friendship.

He has agreed it’s not enough and he doesn’t like it either. I said that this is farther now and that I don’t want to hang out at these guys’ house. He said it won’t stop him from seeing me. He said that he wants to live with his friends another year then he’ll “feel better about next year” in terms of us living together. I simply responded “okay i love you id like to think about it and talk to you tomorrow.”\n",

      "I just am now thinking. Is this right for me? It seems like we want different things. I don’t know if he is really ready for an adult more mature and serious relationship anymore. His actions are not lining up with his words. What do you all think? Am I being pushy and impatient? Am I being unreasonable? I think his feelings are valid about not being ready and you can’t force it. But I also think I am ready and he’s not. Do I just wait it out and see what happened next year?  \n",

      "We had a fight today that compelled me to post on Reddit. We both grew up with very violent and hateful fathers (mine was reported to CPS twice and his was jailed) and we have already discussed never ever comparing each other to our parents. He also once slipped up and did compare me to my dad but at the time since it was the first time it had happened, I tried to use the therapy skills I had learned and told him that I didn't appreciate when he compares me to him and that we had already agreed not to do so. He apologized and we moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, today I was talking about how I hate hipsters. It was just a stupid silly little conversation topic, nothing serious, but I was taken aback when my boyfriend said, \"You know who you're reminding me of right now?\" And I said, \"Who?\" and he said \"Your father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In fairness he immediately knew he had fucked up and he said, \"OK, I didn't mean it like that,\" but he was kind of laughing about it. He always laughs when he's uncomfortable but I have told him multiple times that it doesn't matter if he laughs due to discomfort as it literally is just disrespectful. I told him I was really mad and he was like \"Wait seriously?\" and used that goofy voice people have when they aren't taking things seriously yet - \"Aww babe you know I didn't mean it! I was justttt kiddinggg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We couldn't really talk on the way home as we were on a motorcycle and wearing helmets, but I was thinking about it more and more and getting more and more angry. I was pretty quiet as we got back into the apartment and after some time he asked me if I was still mad. I said I was and he said \"Come on you're still upset? It was literally a joke.\" Which made me more upset! I told him that he never actually said sorry and that in general his apologies are really insincere and he never seems to take me seriously, and that I hate when he just laughs or says \"Come on\" and tries to make everything seem lighthearted as if to resolve things without actually caring about my feelings. He told me that he wants to keep things lighthearted because even though he's sorry I feel that my day is ruined, he doesn't want his to be ruined as well. I got really angry about that and told him he always acts like he doesn't care about my feelings at all and just wants everything to be easygoing.\n",

      "Finally after an hour of back and forth arguing he said he was sorry and realized he was an asshole and that he hates how often he hurts my feelings, but this was after an hour of defending himself. I feel like this happens every time we have an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also argued 2 days ago. This one was my fault though I think. He had come to pick me up and we hadn't seen each other in a week or so (we hang out pretty often - not codependently as we have our own friends and plans, but we also really enjoy spending time together or at least coming home to each other) and I ran up to the car very excited to see him. I guess I'm not usually a very outwardly excited person so I don't generally run to greet him, so he was confused and just rolled down the window halfway and was like \"Um what are you doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt very hurt and didn't think he was happy to see me and he acted quite nonchalant in the car, so I was quieter than usual. The problem is he can tell when I'm in a bad mood so he started probing to figure out what was wrong, and when people pressure me to talk about something I'm not ready to talk about, I get even quieter. I was not mad though and I was just really struggling to figure out my feelings as I felt a lot of hurt but wasn't sure if my feelings were valid or not (as I know I can be very sensitive). But he immediately started getting mad and was like \"Why are you being sooo quiet right now, like come on why are you always like this?\" We ended up fighting badly that night because he was really frustrated I wasn't communicating and I was crying because I couldn't figure out how to sort out all the thoughts I was having.\n",

I think we are also pretty good at explaining how we feel but really bad at listening to each other. We're both in therapy and I'm trying to work on communicating when I need space instead of shutting down. He thinks I always find something to be upset about, as I get upset about a lot of things he says, and I think he doesn't actually consider my feelings when he says things since I feel like he often says hurtful things and then justifies them as jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We really enjoy spending time together and both want to be better for the other person. We do always end up resolving things and hugging/apologizing sincerely/talking things out, it just takes sooo long to get there (like after hours of him being frustrated and me crying). I just can't figure out how to resolve these issues better or faster.

      "Body text: Hi everyone, sort of a long post but wanted to vent and get some opinions on my situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I (25M) have been in a LDR for a couple months now. I have known my girlfriend for over 3 years (we met online) and have visited her a couple times over the past couple months. We are a couple states away about 11 hours driving distance away and 2 by flight. She lives with her parents, while I live with a relative.\n",
      "\n",
      "For background, I am miserable with my current location in just about every category. I don't really have a close relationship with my family where I'm at. I pretty much am alone here, do everything on my own. I don't have a social circle/friends to do things so it's very lonely. I often struggle a lot due to the loneliness. On top of that, I'm not very satisfied with my full time job and want to switch careers to something entirely different. So needless to say, my mental health is struggling being here and feels like I need a reboot. On the other hand, my girlfriend comes from a very loving and supportive family, in a beautiful town that I enjoy being in. All of her family loves me and for once in my life when I'm there I just feel so peaceful. My ultimate goal is to build a future with her and family, and making this family of my own one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I've been trying to find a job in her city to move and be with her (I would be supporting myself, getting my own apartment, etc). The problem is, I feel like I'm struggling so much I don't think I have the willpower to keep going where I am at to wait so long before that happens. So I had an idea of leaving my job, finding a room to rent (I may be able to with a relative of hers for cheap), and then finding a job once I'm there. My thought is that I could use my personal savings to live off for a couple months and find a job to do in the mean time hoping that it'd be easier to find a job once I'm there.\n",
      "\n",
      "My reasons to doing that option are: 1) I get to be with her and her family, which in turn would b) improve my mental wellbeing. The obvious downsides are it's an incredibly risky move. I don't see breaking up ever really happening, because i feel like she's the one, we are compatible in every way. The only risky part comes financially but I understand i'd struggle a bit and be okay with it. She is supportive no matter what I decide to do, but it's mostly on me that I'm leaning towards doing the move first because of my struggle. Any perspective or questions on this would be greatly appreciated. I feel like the pros to moving very soon would outweigh the big con but i'm okay with it. Am I justified in thinking this way?\n",

      "\n",
      "I’d say he does it quite frequently. I mean, he definitely has months where he does pull through and sees me a good amount but then there’s also moments where I don’t see him for over a week (sometimes two) because something keeps coming up and he is unable to come that day. We will literally have the entire date or hang out scheduled down to the time and where we’re going/ what we’re going to do and he still cancels or reschedules to the next day. \n",

      "\n",
      "Heres what happened that has really been annoying me: I haven’t seen my boyfriend in two weeks now. I’ve been busy with my job and I did catch a really bad cold so a few of those days were fine because I did not want to hang out with him and accidentally get him sick, but I am no longer contagious and I feel better and I have been wanting to. However, for the past week/two, there’s always something that comes up. Either it’s a family thing, he didn’t sleep well, he feels he has a lot on his plate that day so he wants to reschedule, or he doesn’t feel well. (For added context he suffers with depression but is currently not on anything for it, he sees a therapist.) \n",

      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today when I was supposed to see him and I just woke up to a text that says he has to reschedule to hang out with me later tonight instead of the planned afternoon date we had because he hung out with his guy friends and drank more than he should’ve (I had asked him if he could please be mindful about going too overboard so that he’s able to see me the next day but that did not happen.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I also want to add that he hadn’t seen his friends in over 5 months and he also reschedules on them a lot so it’s not just to me, but I’m the one who sees him the most so it happens to me frequently. I did not want to ruin his guy night as I know it was much needed for him, but I had politely asked him if he could please not drink too much so that he won’t feel gross for today and he said he would try his best, but I guess things got carried away. \n",

      "Body text: My GF \\[36F\\] and I \\[33M\\] have been together for almost 5 years. I really love her—she’s an amazing person, and we’ve been through a lot together. But over time, things have evolved in such a way, that I'm starting to wonder if we’re actually compatible long-term. Here are the main issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social life:**  \n",
      "We don't do much besides watching movies or series together. She likes the outdoors (walks, hikes), and we do that often. But it's hard to get her to go out to bars, concerts, or (house) parties with me. The thing is, she *does* do those things with her friends—either in groups or one-on-one—so I end up feeling left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sex:**  \n",
      "We have sex about once every 3-4 weeks, and honestly, it feels flat. She usually wants to stay in control the whole time, and it rarely feels like a intimate/connected moment. She’s mentioned she has a very low libido and that this has been an issue in her past relationships, too.   \n",
      "For context, I’ve had phases in past relationships where sex drive dipped, but with the right atmosphere, we were able to get past it. In this relationship, though, it’s been really hard to create that kind of energy.  \n",
      "At the beginning, our frequency was higher, and even though we didn’t seem super sexually compatible, there were times when we both let go — and honestly, those were some of the best sexual experiences I’ve had. That gave me hope that we could grow and improve over time. But it hasn't really worked out that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Marriage:**  \n",
      "We were both married before. She’s completely against doing it again because her previous marriage was rough. I get it, but for me, marriage still has symbolic value, and I always imagined celebrating with friends and family. Every time I bring it up, she shuts it down, so eventually, I just stopped mentioning it (as I think this is somewhere where I can compromise).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Kids:**  \n",
      "Around year 3, she sat me down to have a \"serious talk\" about kids. She said she definitely wanted to have at least one, and she needed to know where I stood—if I didn’t want kids, she said we probably shouldn’t be together. I told her I did want them. Now, a couple of years later, she’s changed her mind and doesn’t want kids anymore. I also stopped mentioning this, as I most likely want kids, but not 100% sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Living together:**  \n",
      "We don’t live together, and she doesn't want to. She says living with her ex was traumatic and that she easily loses her sense of boundaries and gets depressed. Lately, she’s even said I should just accept that we might never live together, and that living together \"doesn’t mean anything anyway—it's just a societal convention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re both in therapy because we had pretty rough childhoods. Lately, I’ve been learning that it’s important to stand up for my own needs, even if it risks disappointing someone else. I’ve brought up all of these issues multiple times. I've really tried to understand her side, and to find compromises. She says she wants to work on things, and I do believe she values the relationship — but honestly, sometimes it feels like for her things are fine as long as we do things her way. Lately, she’s been pulling away saying I’m being pushy for bringing these things up.  \n",

So the time apart,plus his withdrawal from us has been eating away at me, and I have been communicating but he's not been changing even though  he says he wants us to work out and that he's trying, but I feel like he's dreading my messages and coming home to me .\n",

      "Title: How can I (20M) stop projecting my insecurities on my boyfriend (19M)\n",
      "Body text: Hi, so basically to give a quick summary of my life I  (M 20) grew up with two borderline narcissistic parents and then ended up in a (IMO) narcissistic relationship for almost 3 years when i was in high school that kind of ruined me mentally and my mental stability hasn’t been the same since then unfortunately, even though it ended 2.5 years ago. Fast forward to now, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 1.5 years and I have an issue where I project my insecurities on to him and it definitely causes issues in our relationship. For example: if he’s talking about himself in a good way (something he accomplished or is excited about) I get annoyed on the inside (I hide it well IMO) for two reasons: 1 the other guy would like try to make me feel inferior to him by like elevating his accomplishments so when my bf celebrates his accomplishments, part of me instinctually feels like he’s trying to subtly put me down though I know this isn’t true. The second reason is that that guy over the course of 3 years did make me inferior to him, and anxiously insecure. I partially feel annoyed when my boyfriend is being his amazing self because I feel like I’m such a loser in comparison. I’m socially anxious, he’s a social butterfly. He is so good at staying on top of everything in his life, I’m an ADHD wreck. I hate that I compare myself to him, and I hate having these feelings for someone I love and I just want it to stop. I am in therapy but idk it’s not helping fast enough so just wondering if anyone could share some advice. Please don’t tell me we need to breakup or that I’m a shitty person (I already feel that🫠).\n",

      "Fast forward 2 or so years of us spending many weekends at each others' places (I was at his place alot because of weekend activities with his roommates who I befriended before meeting him) and now hes moved into a new place and we have created a friends group with a couple others. roughly 6 months ago he put a pause on the intimacy because of some major health concerns(long story) and he wanted space while he figures out and adjusts to medications etc and I am fully understanding of everything.\n",

      "I thought enough time had elapsed that despite no closing conversation that things had ended, but I still miss spending nights at his place and everything else thats involved in that. Our group gets together regularly online and in person and we play games with each other alot so its not exactly easy to just break away and take time for myself to let these feelings dissipate. Should I seek closure? I've started feeling jealousy whenever he mentions someone new even though I know theyre not what I was, I also realise this whole situation is pretty unhealthy but its really hard to break away from my now core friend group especially since he hasnt done or said anything directly or intentionally hurtful. How do I even approach the conversation of \"hey are we still on pause? or is it over over?\" I'm struggling because I have come to terms with the fact that it can end, but I don't want to lose him as a friend.\n",

      "Title: I (21M) don't like the lack of communication from my gf (20F). Can i fix this?\n",
      "Body text: This is going to be long, so bear with me. TLDR: Girlfriend has been distant emotionally, especially with our communication within the relationship. Feel more distant than we used to be, not sure how to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me (21M) and my girlfriend (20F) have been together for 4 months now. The beginning of the relationship (2 months) was phenomenal, like, I don’t think it could’ve been better. We were inseparable, we took day trips in and out of the city, we went on dates, we hung out and we did so much with each other. Not only that but I felt wanted. Any time we’d do anything together she’d have this sparkle in her eye and she’d be excited/gitty to get to spend time with me, whereas lately? That's almost been nonexistent, there's no excitement about hanging out with me anymore and it kinda hurts. About a month or so ago I felt a little bit of a shift. We both got really busy with life, which is natural. We spent a little time a part, but things also got emotionally distant, she stopped updating as much as she used to, and sometimes things felt off. She had some family stuff happen, so I chalked it up to the fact that she could’ve been stressed from that, school, and her work. However, when her schedule lightened up, and I thought things would go back to the way they were, they didn’t. The updating never went back to the way it was, we planned a lot however we haven’t really spent a lot of time together recently. Lately I’ve felt more like a friend than a boyfriend. I do have a pretty severe case of anxiety and fear of abandonment, I was cheated on throughout the entirety of my first relationship and then left like I meant nothing in my second. So I have a bit of ptsd when it comes to that. I’m working on myself and working on making sure my anxiety and feelings don’t control me. However, lately because of this change I’ve been overly anxious. Last week she felt very overwhelmed and snapped that I need to compromise on things, she then finally told me the reason for not updating me as much was that because as we became more comfortable with each other, she starting settling and didn’t feel the need to update as much as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem that I had with that is why not communicate that with me before she snapped? We’ve talked about how communication is very important but I feel as if it’s been lacking, a lot recently. While I am at fault for my anxiety, there’s also been no communication at all for how she’s been feeling. Another thing is that, I feel like over the past 2 weeks I’ve taken a backseat. She is going on a girls trip to Europe in a week and a half, so I made a planner for things for us to do together before she leaves, out of the 15 things I had planned, we’ve done 1 thing. I understand she has her own life, and that I can’t be the only source of happiness, I want her to hang out with friends and have other hobbies, but I am her boyfriend and to me a relationship is more than just seeing each other once a week. (We live 20 minutes from each other, so distance certainly isn’t an issue). She had her last exam yesterday (which i also do understand she has every right to take time to study, would never want her to fail because she spent time with me over studying, would feel horrible), however, she said she was going to a friends place to binge a tv series when she finished. No issues with that initially, but I would’ve liked to have known a little before.\n",
      "\n",
      "However today, I had a surprise planned as it’s her first day since finishing this year of school. She texted me at 9am, but I didn’t hear a word until almost 5pm, I texted her when I woke up at 10, then again at 1 and 3. Not a single text that she was out with this same friend until she texted at 5. I understand she has friends and can absolutely hang out with them, not saying otherwise, but this is also the same friend that she’s going to Europe with. Doesn’t make me feel all that great that she’d rather spend a full day with the friend she’s going to be with for the next month with no break, rather than her boyfriend who she won’t see for a month. But I get it, she has her own life and I can’t control what she does or who she hangs out with. The issue is that there was not one mention that she’d be out the whole day. To me, the bare minimum would be “Hey, going with \\_\\_\\_, gonna be busy most of the day, love you, talk to you later”. Something like that, it shows she values me and my feelings. I had not one clue she was out the whole day until she texted me a full 8 hours later, and I had stuff planned for us to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I’m making this way bigger than it is, but I just haven’t felt like a priority, or that my feelings are considered. Her actions haven’t really matched her words either and I don’t really know what to do. I want to bring this up with her in a calm approach, but idk if this will cause her to snap again like she did last week. I feel stuck and have no idea what to do. Someone please help. \n",

      "Body text: Me (F21) and my girlfriend (F23) have been together for about three or so months. She is respectful, kind, compassionate and an amazing person but I do not think I am attracted to her romantically. We connected over a dating app and our dates hit it off, and as a result, She was moving pretty quickly, wanting to get together. with my people pleasing tendencies, along with my peers who told me that lesbians naturally move fast and that is how it is, I went with it thinking it was right as I genuinely connected with her. An important note is that this is my first wlw relationship experience. I had always known I was attracted to women but never had any prior experience until her and also am in the process of deconstructing my compulsive heterosexuality which adds more layers of complications. I’ve grown to realize that I am not compatible with her in a romantic context and know that the best thing for the both of us to be upfront and honest but she’s become very attached and comfortable and I also fear that she will think I used her to experiment when that was not the case. I want to be able to talk to her but I have such deeply ingrained people pleasing tendencies (that I am currently in therapy for amongst other things) that my mind keeps telling me that it would be easier to ride it out rather than to deeply hurt her as she fell for me rather quickly. I would appreciate any advice, comments, or tips on how to navigate this. \n",

      "Body text: So I (25F) have a friend group of 6 people, myself, 25M, 25F, 26F, 26F, and 26F. We all started growing up with each other starting in elementary school and started forming a group by the time we were in high school. We all were pretty aligned back then since we had the same hobbies and afterschool programs we did and tbh we were kinda the artsy quirky kids so it made sense.

A big reason I moved back was the homesickness and how I missed my friends and family and they all said how much they missed me and wanted me home so taking that dive felt right. For the first few months it was great seeing everyone again and I felt good, it’s now just gotten idk… awkward. It feels like personalities and priorities have shifted a lot both with myself and them and while I’m not saying we’re completely misaligned but it’s more like we’re all in completely different places. I’m not who I used to be and neither are they, and while that’s okay it scares me.

I got pregnant probably around a year into our relationship and I was so ecstatic, I never felt that he felt the same way because he was still going out and drinking with friends etc while getting upset with me for just going to the mall with my friends or out to eat.

      "Body text: \n",
      "We are very different in a few ways, she is pretty avoidant with attachment and i lean more anxious. She avoids conflict and deep talks about how she feels, for this reason we never argue and i fear she builds resentment. She has a very strange friend group dynamic. 2 exes within the same group. It’s her only group and they meet regularly (as a group). Often very late and with alcohol involved. 1 of them she claims is her ‘best friend’ and doesn’t count as an ex, and they message and meet regularly. The key issue is when they all meet theres a pretty obvious lack of communication about what she is up to and I only get simple details if I ask directly. The thing is I trust her, and I dont see them as a threat, I sort of know what I bring. I also don’t drink and exercise every day and do not see the attraction of a club/alcohol. As a result often stay up worrying whilst she is out. It’s more about does it go against boundaries I have and whether the principle of it is disrespectful. I often am made to feel needy and insecure when setting boundaries or asking simple details of what she is up to, yet I know I am not asking too much. I like to believe deep down she has good intentions but am I being naive to the reality of it? It seems more so than ever she is withdrawing and not present/excited when with me, but yet again she swears everything is okay when I ask. I think good communication can solve these issues but I can never get anything meaningful out of her when having these serious chats other than ‘thats fair’ or ‘i dont know what to say’. \n",

      "So we have been dating for 5 years or so. He is my first serious relationship I kind of don't know anything else but him. Our relationship has always been good he treats me well no concerns and our families love eachother/us. I have tired to break up with him a year ago because I felt like we were falling out of love at that point which I thought he felt the same which he didn't. We talked it out mentioned things we needed to work on and decided to continue on. Well we both didn't try super hard (probably more me I feel like I accidently distanced myself more with school and other responsibilities | took on). Since we started dating pretty young eveythibg was great until I started to find myself a little more and realized we don't have much in common. We have some stuff but not enough. I am a gamer and he dosent really game and dosent want to game with me specifically (I do play pc and he's console). I enjoy trying lots of foods and going to restaurants and cooking new things.\n",
      "He like has a fear of trying new foods and isn't adventurous at all. He is very sporty which I used to be and I will go lift at the gym but he dosent lift only plays the sports he wants to play which is fine too. Our sex life has also gone down a lot. In the past 2 years or so.\n",
      "Marriage wise he's very religious and I am just not and do not plan on getting married in a church or by a priest. So those are just a few things that bother me with this. I don't know what to do because we have a lot of history together and ofc I am scared to leave him since I know nothing else. My other delima is we have a trip planned together in October (we had to pay ahead and pick our roommates so we are rooming with another couple). He is still a really great person to be around and I trust him/I can tell him anything he's like family to me. I don't know if I should fight for this relationship harder because I really put a lack of effort in. Or just call it quits. HELP!\n",

      "Title: He 23M and I 19F have been dating for a month. He recently broke up from a 6year relationship. How shall I handle this?\n",
      "Body text: Unsure how to navigate this connection with someone who opens up slowly and struggles with consistent communication\n",

      "\n",
      "I (F, 19) met X (M, 23) a few months ago in a university dance class. He had just come out of a long-term (6-year) relationship, (now it has been 4 months since their break up) which I know was difficult, but he never talks about it and avoided my question when I once asked why they broke up. \n",
      "EDIT**: I should note that from a friend's friend I found out that they did not end on good terms , it was a harsh breakup.\n",
      "\n",
      "We began talking, dancing, and spending time alone—discussing philosophy, art, and life's big questions, as well as our biggest fears and best accomplishments/goals. We've gone on a few dates, kissed (nothing more), and when we're together, we act almost like a couple. He’s slowly opening up to me and seems to genuinely appreciate me. In person, the chemistry is undeniable. He’s affectionate, attentive, and emotionally present—holding hands, cuddling under the moonlight, sharing quiet moments.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But when we're apart, things shift. He becomes distant over text and sometimes goes days without responding. I brought it up once and explained what I usually look for in a romantic connection—not demanding it from him, just stating my needs. He admitted he couldn't guarantee change but would try. Since then, he has been more consistent with messaging, and showing that he heard me and understood my needs-but my need is not yet his need- therefore the communication is not yet at a level that feels balanced to me.  \n",

I genuinely enjoy the moments we share, but I’m not sure if it’s *him* I’m attached to, or the experience itself. I tilt towards the experience part though.I value emotional depth and openness in a partner, and I wonder if this has even the potential to grow into something more real—or if it's destined to remain surface-level.\n",

      "**TL;DR:** I’m unsure how to move forward with someone who’s warm and present in person but emotionally reserved and inconsistent otherwise. I value emotional connection and communication. How can I approach this situation with clarity and self-respect?\n",

      "Title: My mother in law (65F) hurt me (25M) and I don’t know how to resolve the conflict\n",
      "Body text: This is a long post, sorry. I really hope for advice and felt it was necessary for you to have all the information. In the following I want to bring you closer to: The events that led to me being hurt; the background and why this might have happened; how I feel about it; how to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE EVENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother in law was disagreeing with how I trained my dog and didn’t talk to me about it until her disagreement had already turned into anger. I didn’t notice anything, but brought up the topic at Christmas - she then started asking passive aggressive questions. I answered her questions very calmly. She has never had a dog; I have been actively learning about dog training for many years now and wanted to share my knowledge so she can understand why I do things how I do them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the whole conversation she was rolling her eyes at me and obviously stating with her body language that I am just talking nonsense. I stopped myself mid sentence and said (again very calmly) that I don’t like how this is going. That I don’t have the feeling she’s listening. In response to this she started shouting at me (loudly). That she’s had enough of me; that I can not treat her this disrespectful etc. I was very confused whether I had done something wrong, but other people at the table immediately stated that I handled everything greatly. I got really overwhelmed though and had to retreat to my partners room. She continued shouting next door for an hour. Talking badly about me, how this is unacceptable etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few hours later I approached her and let her know that I would like to talk tomorrow over breakfast. She was whiny and started talking about how much I hurt her and how she doesn’t know whether she can forgive me. I didn’t say anything, just nodded. The next morning I approached her again asking whether she’s ready to talk. She stated that she doesn’t think there’s anything to talk about. Then continued accusing me of tearing her family apart, ruining the weekend for everyone, driving her kids away etc. She made me responsible for all her bad feelings (and those were some pretty bad feelings). I got so angry - I haven’t been angry like this in a very long time, my head felt like it would burst. I am usually one to speak up, but my partner (32M, partner of 5 years) and his brothers (36M/25M) adviced me not to do so at this point, since they didn’t think she’d be receptive to logic. So again I didn’t say anything, but started crying this time. I got very overwhelmed, Iocked myself in my partners room and had a massive, violent meltdown. Apparently she was shouting for me to shut up and my partner told her that what she is doing is not okay (which was a very big deal for him as he usually just shuts down). I have never seen him as hurt as he seemed after this. He packed our bags and we and his brothers left.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this I wrote a very long letter, which I never sent. We haven’t had contact since. A few days ago I received a short letter from her. She writes that she is sorry things escalated on Christmas and that she was just very hurt and angry with me. I don’t consider this an apology…? I am pretty sure she expects me to say I’m sorry too and never for us to talk about it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE BACKGROUND\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family has a long history of avoiding conflict. They don’t talk about things they don’t like, everything has to be friendly and polite. From their understanding negative emotions are bad and need to be shut down. Her kids are just unlearning this. They have been hurting for a long time and her explosion seems to have triggered some change for them. She on the other hand never learned what healthy conflict looks like. What she is doing - lashing out and then considering herself as the victim - is exactly what her mother was doing to her too. It is why she resents her so much and why she thinks it’s good to „stand up for herself“ now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has been pouring her heart out to one of her sons (who isn‘t really stable himself, 25M) for quite a while now. She is in a bad place right now and told him that the conflict with her kids, him transitioning, her chronic pain etc. is affecting her so much that she’s suicidal. Her husband (who is a psychiatrist, 70M) has been helping her as good as he can, but he doesn’t worry about her actually being suicidal too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW I FEEL\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure what exactly I need, but one thing I know is that I can’t feel comfortable around her as long as she’s convinced my behavior was wrong. My ability to calmly handle conflict and talk openly on one level with the other party is actually something I like about myself. I have been masking a lot when visiting them and I don’t want to bend even more. It feels unfair. I am not even sure I could: I am already having a hard time keeping up with social rules and if there’s more rules - rules I not only don’t understand, but also don’t like - it is only a matter of time until I make a mistake again. I can’t feel safe knowing that the consequences of me „making a mistake“ are this severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I don’t know is whether I need her to understand that her response is not appropriate. I don’t think her lashing out had anything to do with me in particular. It seems like me being direct and emotionally available has triggered something that was prone to blow up one day. Her kids feel that it’s time to break the family pattern now, but they are somewhat convinced she’s too old to learn and won’t talk logic with her. It’s not really my place to muscle in and if I do I probably only make things worse for myself. But even if this is the case, she still blew up in my face and hurt me. I don’t feel comfortable acting like this is not a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all this I have to say that in the process she did somewhat loose my respect and I don’t know how this will affect my behavior around her in the future. I am not one to hold a grudge and I do understand that her emotions are real and she is not doing this out of malice. But she is also a grown woman and should have enough self awareness to be held accountable for her harmful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I want to be around her we will also need to talk about the dog training once more; otherwise it will come up again or be cause of more anger on her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW TO PROCEED\n",
      "\n",
      "Theres so much I could and would like to say, but I don’t know what would actually benefit the situation. I want to find a middle ground between being understanding and open while staying fair and true to myself. I have no idea how to bring her closer to the idea that I might not have been the one showing questionable behavior, but she is. And how to say all this without triggering her again…\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I am unsure about the best medium to lead this conversation. Writing is a lot easier for me, I get overwhelmed easily when talking and have a hard time processing fast enough to respond adequately. On the other hand she might be overwhelmed by the content of my letter, put her own interpretations into it and not respond. My favorite options would be for her to read the letter with her therapist or for us talking with a neutral third party present. I don’t know how to bring her to do this either, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a last resort I hope for you to have advice on how to tackle this. Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR; : My mother in law passive aggressively let me know that she’s angry with me. As I calmly said something about it she started shouting at me. I repeatedly tried to talk to her and she is accusing me of being responsible for a lot of bad feelings she’s having. I don’t know how to feel comfortable being around her again when I don’t understand and like the social rules she is expecting me to follow. I am hoping for advice on how to talk to her about it without triggering her again.\n",

      "Title: Still dating, but breaking up before college (17M and 18NB)\n",
      "Body text: Technically we are still dating so I figured this did not fit r/breakups. Also this is long as heck; scroll to bottom for the questions I have and a TL;DR because this is a little insane to read. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically exactly what the title says. I (17M) started seeing this person (18NB) in early January and officially dating them in mid-February, so currently we've been dating for over three months and seeing each other for four. We agreed when we first started seeing each other that this would be casual and we'd break it off before we left for college. We've been really good friends for all of high school and have been through a lot, so I think we'll stay in touch at least as friends. But I started my senior year in a shitty LDR with someone a grade above me (so, college freshman) so I really did not want another. We didn't have a specific goal in mind for what we would do but we assumed it would just be casual.\n",
      "\n",
      "We unfortunately ended up getting a lot closer within this relationship than we ever meant to. We became official because we realized we were doing everything a couple does besides being called one. I can't fully remember if it was on the same night, but soon after we told each other \"I love you.\" I really do think we love each other. Yes, we're both young of course, but I truly do think I am in love with him. We both realized this, and we revisited our plans for what to do with this relationship. Neither of us think an LDR while in college is a good idea, especially since we're both bad about keeping up with people. We agreed that we'd break up in the summer before college. (We wouldn't be able to break up sooner because we do a ton of activities together and will therefore go on multiple week-long trips together, and we want to use the time in summer to spend more time together. Otherwise I would consider breaking up after high school ends.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I keep thinking about how the day we break up is getting closer and closer. It makes me so sad to think about it. I really like being with my boyfriend now. My relationship with him has been incredibly meaningful and has been helping to change several bad thought patterns/ ideas I built up from other relationships (namely the shitty LDR, lol). I don't want to stop loving him. They are such a special and wonderful guy. I don't like the thought of them with someone else. I don't like the thought of ME with anyone else. I don't want to break up. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm also scared of entertaining an LDR. We'll technically be going to school within 5 hours of each other, but I feel like that's gonna be too far to maintain a serious relationship with a busy college schedule and while trying to acclimate to college life and enjoy ourselves. I don't think it'd be unreasonable to still remain friends, but also there will need to be a period of time where we don't talk so we can get over each other. Part of me is scared I won't ever be able to get over him, at least not for a very long time. I'm worried I won't know how to, because I've never experienced a mutual breakup before. Part of me is also scared that if we don't talk that our friendship with each other will deteriorate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know that if we are really meant to be with each other we will end up together. But I also feel like thinking that way is either just giving up on what we have but in a way that doesn't feel as bad, or it is going to cause me to hope that we'll end up together once all is settled. Honestly I think that it's a little unrealistic to think there are people we're meant to be with; I'm probably gonna end up married to whoever I am in love with and who is present enough in my life to make it work. I don't know if that is the universe working its magic or if that is just normal human companionship. My point is, letting him go with this logic feels sorta stupid since it is so incredibly unlikely we'd come back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do. Is it a good idea to break up before college? I guess I'm sorta settled on the idea that it is, but I also am starting to question if that really is the right move here. And if we do breakup, how will I know when? I'm worried I'll procrastinate it as far as I can because it will hurt. Should I set a date? How do I even approach the conversation of setting a date? Should I bring up the idea of staying in touch? Part of me wants to just stay somewhat romantically involved with each other, even if it's just seeing each other every other month or only on breaks. I also don't think that's healthy, but ugh I just don't know what to do. I feel like crying every time I think about how this is coming to an end, but I don't want to prolong it until it's become something bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - I'm in a very nice high school relationship but college is approaching, and I'm beginning to question our agreement of breaking up before we leave for college. I'm also extremely saddened by the thought of our break up. \n",

      "Body text: I've never written in Reddit and I feel quite lost with one thing so I though I would give it a try. Please be gentle with me, I do not want to blame my girlfriend for this, this is just about my feelings. Me (23M) and my gf (23F) met last September. We have been together for approximately 7 months. We met in September 3rd 2024 for our first date and everything went fine. Then couple days later on 5th of September we agreed via message that our next date would be held in the upcoming week at 10th of September.\n",

      "Now couple months ago she told me she had a one night stand after our first date on 5th of September, the same day we agreed on our next date. I didn't like this info as I always choose to focus on just one person at a time when dating seriously. I feel like I would want my partner to select me right away, and right now this has not happened. We agreed on exclusivity on fourth or fifth date so she did nothing wrong, it's just how it makes me feel and how I would hope my partner would act. I would hope my partner would select me from the beginning and that the exclusivity would be based right away on own will, not an agreement about exclusivity.\n",

It's just how it makes me feel now that we had already met.\n",

She had broken up from a 3 year relationship 3 months ago before we met and she had just started to date again when we met the first time. I had been single for 2 years and I was ready right away to get serious with her.

      "But today my girlfriend and I got into a fight over a screenshot I sent to my friends from Fortnite to discord. Basically in that picture was my friend reviving me because I was knocked on the ground had his hand like next to the my skin's ass. The way this happend was that I got pissed because I got knocked and pushed mouse away from me and the camera just showed us in such view. I thought it was absolutely hilarious and immediately sent it to the discord channel with friends. Yea we laughed about and so on. Didn't think much of it afterwards it's just a game. This picture was sent to the channel on Feb. of 2024 so about a year and something ago.\n",

      "Yesterday my girlfriend had dream about me checking out girls and liking pictures of naked girls on Instagram, checking porn on Reddit and stuff like that basically a thing she is insecure about and I respected it. She is my girlfriend and I want her to be feeling happy in a relationship we have because I really care about her and love her. So to make her feel better about what she had dreams about I gave her my phone and let her go through it to prove my innocence. She didn't find anything. Nothing on Instagram, nothing on Reddit... well did find questionable thing on Reddit but I justified it by me hiding the post and marked it as disturbing so I don't get any more like that so basically I said didn't wanna see anything like it that's why I put it into hidden. That didn't make any problems to her. Yea and it was fine.\n",

      "Then she went through my discord channels and she found my channel with friends and got extremely upset and outraged at the same time about me taking such screenshot and sending it to channel and how can I do such things to her and that it is completely disgusting and disrespectful. Where I replied that it was just a game and I only send it because it was funny and explained her how it happened. Yea well that didn't help at all and she said she didn't find it funny at all and that it is just sick. Then the flight was getting just worse and worse and it basically ended with just bursting out swearing at her which I never did ever ever and then she left. I just couldn't believe how could we fight over such stupid things and found it completely pointless but it just happened and I bursted and I am absolutely sorry for how I acted at the end.

      "Body text: **TL;DR:** My girlfriend (33F) and I (31M) have been together for 5 months. Recently she’s been more critical toward me and less affectionate. She used to talk about living together, but now the idea seems “too much” for her. I’ve been trying hard — going to the gym, taking dance classes — but I feel like she’s pulling away emotionally and physically.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used to have a great connection — affectionate, supportive, intimate. She even used to talk about us possibly moving in together. We never set a timeline, but it felt like something mutual.\n",
      "\n",
      "But recently, she’s been acting different. She told me how much she enjoys being alone at home, and when I said something sweet like *“Soon we’ll have our own place and you can feel free there too,”* she replied: *“Yes, everything has its time. I’m grateful for this place — I know it’s temporary.”* That stung a bit. It felt like she was subtly walking back from the idea of living together, even though she brought it up before.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last couple of weeks, she’s also become more critical of me — saying things like:\n",

      "* *“You don’t close your eyes all the way — that’s creepy.”*\n",
      "* *“Sometimes you look at me weird from behind your glasses.”*\n",

      "At the same time, she compliments other men — saying someone has a nice body, someone else dances really well, etc. I get it — nobody’s perfect, and I’m really trying. I’ve been going to the gym and even started new dance classes, partly because I want to feel better about myself, but also because I miss the kind of attention she now gives to strangers.\n",

Started off the relationship pretty rough but that was mostly due to us being young but overtime it smoothed out a bit and now we're doing quite decent overall. In many ways we're pretty good for each other, we banter and laugh at the same things, share similar values and opinions in many things and we're very comfortable with each other, though not sure if that's just something that comes with how long we've been together.

I'm not really sure what changed but overtime I just don't really get all worked up about her appearance as much anymore both generically and sexually. Don't get me wrong, she's objectively attractive and puts effort into her appearance and ticks all the hygiene boxes. I'm not sure if my preferences have changed over the years or this is just due to me being shallow. Not sure if this is valid, but over the last 2 years or so I've been taking fitness/gym relatively seriously and might have started to think that it's also something I want from my partner.

Recently though we just can’t stop arguing I’m so tired from it all I’m constantly cleaning the house she cooks and I do the rest (dishes,washing,clean the bedroom) she will come home cook then just ditch do her side hustle. I even go out of my way help her out and book her parcels. She’s gotten so bad with it that she will be on two things at once while huffing on her vape and snacking at night. Now I got home noticed my vape was dead so I was like hey algood if I use yours a couple times til I replace it.She would flip out at me saying no. The moment she needs mine I’m always like yep algood. It’s the same if her charger breaks for her phone algood the moment I need hers absolutely not she will flip out at me even though I need to have mine charged cos I get up at 4:30am for work. It’s driving me insane she will not do anything for me and it’s not often I ask for favours I always get up to her demands and try be the best I can but somehow it gets switched to me because I stole her vape or her charger like I don’t ask for much and when I do it’s a big argument and if I don’t let it go it gets worse but it just annoys me I’ll drop anything for her but it’s not the other way round.

      "I 19M am dating my gf18F for over a year now (known her for 2), and I feel like she doesn't appreciate me or respect me in a way? We are both each other's first serious relationship and shes just finishing her first year of college soon for some background info. It's nothing huge it's just tiny things that add up. For example I was at her family's recently for Easter dinner and while we were getting food she poured her drink and I held my cup up then asked for her to pour me some, she then put down the juice container and told me to pour it myself because I'm a man. Another time I was over at her house and she was making herself a sandwich so I asked if she could also make me one and got a similar response. Whenever I go to her house for the weekends (she lives an hour and 30 mins away) she won't let me eat her food or if I do she expects me to pay her (not joking), I got upset at this one morning so she gave me a muffin her mom made while she made herself breakfast. Other things like if I don't text goodnight she won't, she doesn't come to my city for any weekends even though her parents live here because \"gas is too expensive\", one thing that gets under my skin in that she has a guy friend that shes known for 3 years and he has admitted he liked her in the past. He even wrote her a letter saying how happy he is that they're friends when they first started being friends. I've let her know I don't like when she talks to him but I can't force anything, I feel silly writing this but she accepted a gift from him in a video game, it wouldn't bother me but it was a $40 item so to me its not so much that it's a video game but the message behind it? Whenever she is messaging anyone on her phone she also hides her screen from me... We do genuinely get along and for anniversaries or bdays she does spend a lot of time to make me handmade gifts, she doesn't expect me to pay for her when we go out to eat but I do anyways, she doesn't go out on the weekends and has only a couple friends, she pretty much just goes to school and the gym.  For our first date actually she wouldn't let me buy her stuff because I needed to save money for a vehicle, she always talks about our future together and wanting kids eventually. I do love her a ton but I really don't feel like she appreciates me. I'm thinking of having a serious talk with her, I'm not sure if she just has a different love language than me or she's just really frugal or what, but I don't feel like I'm appreciated or really respected , is there some way I could bring this up without being too confrontational about it? \n",

It seemed small, but it felt like a significant disconnect at the time.\n",

But the truth is, we’re very different people, and making the relationship work has always required effort from both sides.\n",

      "Mike and I have been friends since middle school, and got along very well. I am very extroverted and social, he's much more introverted but very smart, and he's very social when it's just him and I together. Both of us are queer. There have definitely been times over the years where the nature of our relationship blurred; we generally attend each other's family functions, and visit each other about twice a month (\\~6 hour travel).  \n",

      "In the past few years, I feel as though this friendship is causing a strain on my ability to seek out or be in a romantic relationship. He is very protective, and admittedly my taste in partners has historically been....not great. We talk very openly about how much we love each other (platonically in the way we discuss), and it's been a clear conversation that he does not want a physical relationship. Not just in a sexual sense - he is very touch averse, does not generally like close contact in the way that I would have with other friends (hugging when they arrive/leave a stay at my house, sitting closely together if somewhere crowded, etc).  \n",

I have been in three serious relationships in the same time, including one of two years and then two shorter.  \n",

We share clothes, vacation together, take road trips, are close with each other's families, etc. We have a number of inside jokes and catch phrases, all of which boil down to our sort of \"motto\" of \"us against the world.\" It's cheesy, but in hard times in my life it has really comforted me.  \n",

However, I feel both emotionally and logistically stifled in seeking out other relationships. I feel emotionally committed to someone else. And, in times where I have gone on a number of dates with the same person, I find myself feeling like I am lying or deceiving when I am describing stories that involve him without disclosing the complicated nature of it, so I just end up backing out of the potential relationship instead.  \n",

      "Body text: I'm (F24) in my first relationship with my partner (NB23). We've been together for coming up on 2 years. Because I didn't realize I was gay until college, I didn't get into my first relationship until I was 22. \n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, it was thrilling, exciting, and amazing. I'd never had this type of relationship or intimacy with another person before. I felt that I loved them very quickly, and they did, too. I still love them tremendously. They're my best friend and I worry about them constantly. They've made so much progress since we've been together and have become so much more stable since we've started dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our main problem is that we are terrible at fighting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our fights started out as very calm and controlled; they even told me that they whisper during fights to make sure they don't yell. But they also felt that i was overly defensive during fights and it made it difficult to communicate or get anywhere with me. Eventually the fights became nasty and longer. The first really bad one, they wouldn't let me go to sleep and we fought until 5 am until I couldn't stop hysterically crying and they realized I was past my limit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, almost every fight has been that bad. I definitely contribute to it - I have a lot of difficulty letting something go if I feel like I have been misrepresented (ex. if they say that I did something \"all day\", I feel the urge to defend myself that it was \"only at breakfast\") and I do embarrassingly have trouble admitting when I was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a habit of exaggerating what they're accusing me of, putting words in my mouth, and when I argue against that and tell them what I feel that I \"actually\" said, they get very angry. Lately, they've been yelling a lot; they used to stop once I pointed it out, but now they don't. We had one very bad fight in November where they yelled and threw a bunch of my stuff around the room, and though they were EXTREMELY apologetic afterwards, their behavior has started ramping back up to that level. Once I'm crying and unable to respond functionally, they tell me that I'm making them out to be the bad guy and they'll end up having to apologize the next day even though they were the one \"in the right\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm mostly writing this so I can hold myself accountable and force myself to remember how they actually act in a fight. I know we both make mistakes, but it's left me so scared to bring up any issues or defend myself when they bring up an issue, and I leave every fight so, so, so confused about who was right or wrong and whether I am as mean/selfish as they say. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know what most of the advice will probably be, but I really do love them and I can't talk about this with any of my in-person friends or family. Please let me know how to get them to remain calm during fights and how to tell who is right/wrong. \n",

We have been together for a little over 5 months and things have been going good so far, we've had a good schedule going with making time for each other and prom is coming up soon but I'm not so sure about the future of the relationship. I have been really worn out because she always has problems with the relationship or with me, either I don't put enough effort into it or I don't reassure her enough.\n",

She reassures she does love me which I believe And I just feel terrible for even considering leaving her. She also has had a tough time at home with her parents fighting, she doesn't have a lot of friends, and her mom is mean to her. She often says I'm the only good one in her life which makes me feel like I have no choice but to stay with her. She also gets extremely clingy and jealous because I had a good friend that was the opposite gender and I understand I have to stop hanging out with her but she gets very mad even when i just say hi to her in the halls. Any contact with someone of the opposite gender and she breaks down. She also cries a lot over little things and I feel like she guilt trips me whenever we argue. I just need to see other opinions on my life. And with prom coming up, I feel like if I do decide to break up with her I should do it after prom. When we were eating lunch and she was laying on my shoulder and I felt grossed out and immediately regretted dragging it out this long.\n",

      "Body text: I’m expanding on an earlier post: I found out my boyfriend was lying, going behind my back, and hiding things about him and his girl “best friend”. I would consider it emotionally cheating but I’m not sure that’s right. They have an extremely deep connection and I had tried to draw some (what I thought were reasonable) boundaries around the amount of attention/time he was giving her toward the beginning of the relationship due to a few warning signs (they were calling late at night, she wanted him to go over and watch shows without me being welcome, he hid his phone and lied about texting her early on, etc.)…. But he’s been hiding and lying about all of this: he’s actually been texting her literally all day every day, calling her all the time when he’s not with me, venting to her about our relationship/me, she’s been disrespectful toward me in their messages/called me a b-word and he never defended me but he would defend her all the time if I ever brought her up, been watching movies and gaming with her on Discord whenever he’s not with me, she sends him selfies, she’s sent essay texts asking for more effort from him and he’s agreed, and more. He admitted he would tell me he was busy spending time with his family or just studying/doing chores during these times because I would be waiting to spend time with him. He even hid that he went up and saw her in person (albeit with 2 other people there to my knowledge) to watch tv. I had felt suspicious and worried about her on several occasions, but he assured me it was just my anxiety (I struggle with OCD/anxiety). He’s also been talking to a different girl more than he had led me to believe who he had a past situationship with. On top of that, I found out he’s been going on OnlyFan links through Instagram every other day, even when he’s physically been with me in my apartment. He says he has an addiction. He’s practically been living with me and we were talking about moving in with each other around August. He begged for my forgiveness, but he will not cut her off completely. He said he can bring the contact down to “1%,” but isn’t willing to lose a “friend” who apparently brings him “stability” and “solace.” The only way he is willing to make the relationship work with me is for me not to make him block her. I’ve asked what I can do better, but he says I’ve done more than any one could expect - I’m so confused. Is there a way to rebuild trust if I agree to just more limited contact with her?\n",

      "So little back story to the this I’m (32M) and my partner is (30F) we have 2 beautiful daughters together we have been together for 5 years and mid way into our 3rd year we moved away from our hometowns and moved in together we are now 6/7 hours away from hometown. We had the kids after we moved away ( we moved away for better quality of life cheaper rent crime and such ) move was from NYC to NC ( Raleigh ) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship started out good she comes from a great family she has a good work ethic and a lot of ambition for her future but from the Very beginning I noticed something that I should’ve made a bigger deal then I did but I felt like I could help her change , she was really bad at communicating like REALLY BAD when something even super minor bothers her she’ll close up and go a few days without saying even a word to me like legit not a word I get home from work and try and try and she’ll listen to me talk and will just scroll on her phone and eventually care for the girls and go to bed . I have a lot of patience since I’m really good at communicating since the beginning I’ve been trying to help her get better at it , she pretty much is mad about 5 of our 7 days of the week and those days might aswell throw them away relationship wise bc she won’t speak to me. I take great care of my kids I provide protect and I’m the silly fun parent , my kids are my world . But she uses the kids as ammo against me to hurt me I’d say about 2 times a week she threatens me with the kids exact words are if we brake up I’m moving back home with my parents , now she does say that she doesn’t want to keep the kids from me I’ll have full access to them bc she doesn’t want to cause the girls any harm but that she moved with me here and so if we’re not together no point in her being here . \n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to break my heart not to have my little girls with me on a daily basis bc I’ve made a career here and landed a really good job , so I’ll have to travel to see my girls now which I’m willing to do bc they’re worth every ounce of effort to go see , but part of my wants to fix things but it seems impossible bc this has been going on for about the length of the relationship and it’s making feel miserable to the point where coworkers and family members have mentioned things like you look terrible or you don’t smile as much as you used to .\n",
      "When she goes 5 days without speaking to me she makes me sleep on the couch , once she’s ready to talk she then apologizes and says sorry I get excited and happy but she’s right back to her normal self in maybe 1 or 2 days for the slightest reason sometimes not even things that happen at home even work problems , example last week she went 4 days without talking to me because I went to play basketball with my brother instead of taking her out , my grandma is 91 I barely get to see her bc she gets upset when I go see my grandma bc in her words I should worry about the family I created not my old family. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll end it here I’m not perfect but I come home from work and I say hi to her try to give her a kiss and I go straight to my girls and I’m on the floor wrestling and playing with them all the way until they’re ready for bed I do this everyday and I wouldn’t trade it for the world but everyone around me keeps telling me next time she says she’s moving back to let her go and the will always have me because I’ll make sure of it but I have to take care of my peace and happiness .\n",

      "Body text: So, I'm currently in college, and will graduate in about a year. I met my boyfriend two years ago, fresh out of a break up following a sort of phase where I had started exploring a little bit more. Said break up was caused by my indescretions when I was drunk, and I felt quite remorseful afterwards but I understood why it happened. I'm saying this to kind of put it out there that I'm not good in relationships - I guess you could say I'm one of those bleeding heart types that feels a little too much of everything, but despite that (or maybe because of that) I'm not especially stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, back to the relationship. He graduated a year ago, and we've been long distance since. He has a pretty good job, so he visits me every 2-3 months (via flight, because we're in two distant cities). He usually finances the trip himself, as well as the place both of us end up staying at, as well as all meals. I've been becoming more guilty about the money aspect of it, because the thing is that even though my parents still support me, I feel guilty using too much of their money towards this when I haven't made it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of this, the LDR has been pretty taxing - calls have become exhausting, I barely talk to him about the things that bother me, and I treat every conversation like a sparring match. Not my intention, but purely instinctual. I can't maintain a good conversation unless I'm ranting about something or debating something. Every call feels like work, somewhat. When I'm with my friends, and he calls, I hardly ever want to pick up now. When I say 'I love you too', there's a definite part of me that feels fake. People tell me that long distance isn't easy, but is it supposed to make you feel like shit?\n",
      "\n",
      "I just feel like I'm with this amazing guy, who for some really needs me to be with him, but I can't shake myself out of my head enough. I feel like such a bad person all the fucking time. I have a good support system with my family and friends, so I can lean on them all I want. But I'm the only one he ends up opening up to, so I feel like I can't even leave without hurting him. And if I do, I'll be the worst person ever, like there's no getting over that guilt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I wish he was cheating, or he said something red flag-ey, or if he thought he was too good for me. I wish he would break my heart, and leave me be to get out of it because I know I can.

They were as lovey-dovey when they started as when things took an unfortunate turn causing them to break up. It's making me think that perhaps we are just fundamentally different in what we expect, but at the same time I can't help but feel she's seeing things through rose-tinted glasses. Perhaps the spark in her previous relationship stayed because of how young she was? I don't know. I'm not a professional.\n",

      "Body text: I(27F) have been with my partner (29m) for almost nine years, about a year and a half ago we separated briefly. I was going through a very dark period emotionally and mentally. Not long after I moved out, I met someone online. He came to visit me shortly after I moved into my new place and we slept together then kept in contact afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later I lost my apartment and had no choice but to move back in with my (ex) boyfriend. We never clearly talked about whether we were back together, now I know he assumed we were exclusive since I moved back in. I kept quiet about what happened while we were apart, including the fact that I had continued seeing other people. I was still talking to the first guy I met and eventually I went to see him again while I was traveling. I lied to my partner about where I was going and when I came back, he went through my phone and found out everything. He saw messages, pictures, and found out I had been with multiple people. That night he hit me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve stayed living together. He tells me he forgives me but constantly brings everything up, checks my phone, calls me horrible names, and says I ruined his life. He flips between being kind and completely breaking me down. He blames his drinking on me and tells me I destroyed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I spent a month in Paris. It was meant to be a break for me, a reset. But he made me feel like I had to stay in constant contact. If I did not message him fast enough or stay on the phone long enough, he would get angry. While I was there, I saw someone again and we ended up sleeping together. Eventually, my partner found out about that too. He saw pictures and everything exploded again. Since then, he keeps using the past to shame me and control how I live now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am jobless. I have no support system. I feel completely stuck. I know I made mistakes. I know I hurt people. But I do not believe I deserve to live like this. I feel like I have no freedom and no peace. I do not know how to leave or where to go. I just know I cannot keep living this way.\n",

      "If anyone has been through anything like this, I would appreciate any advice or support. I do not know what to do anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR:\n",
      "After my partner and I broke up, I met someone new and we stayed in contact even after I moved back in with my ex. He later found out I had slept with multiple people, including while I was traveling. He hit me when he found out and now uses it all to control me. We still live together. He calls me names, controls everything I do, and blames me for everything. I have no job, no support, and feel completely trapped.\n",

      "Body text: I (18F) am unsure if I am imagining this, but I feel like she (18F) used to love me more when I did not love her as much, and when I did not use to be as affectionate. Before we got together, we tried to talk like a couple, and she kept telling me that I was not affectionate enough and did not show her my love. When we finally got in a relationship, I decided to change, but now she's gone and changed herself. I recognize these behaviors from past relationships, even when subtle. I feel like she is getting an ick from my affection (since her last talking stage with a man, she told me she got an ick from him loving her too much). Should I go back to the way I was? I don't usually open up in relationships or show affection, so I fear this will be a horrible experience and that I will never show love again. FYI, we have only been in a relationship for 5 months.\n",

      "Body text: My bf and I have been together since the beginning of the year. We have the same goals and views on relationships and what we want. Or so I think?

      "\n",

      "What bothers me is  I had walked in on him once, he pretended to be sleeping, it was odd but I let it go. An hour or so later I had gone back in there bc I was putting laundry up.

      "two days later, I had been trying to sleep and couldn’t ( insomniac). He was up in the living room so I got up to sit with him. I walked in and he was watching porn and masturbating. As soon as he saw me he turned his phone off, covered himself and looked shocked. I sat down and took a second before asking him what he was doing. He said looking through tik tok. I asked him if I could look at his phone, he retorted with why does that matter. He opened his phone ( away from me) and showed me tik tok. Thing is I know it wasn’t, his tik tok is on dark mode and he was on a bright white screen. with porn on it. I looked at him shocked. I didn’t say anything else. He said I’m making such a big deal and always acting like he’s doing something. And yelled I’m not even hard (even though he was). I got upset and went and laid back down. \n",

      "\n",
      "A week after that, I broke down. I’ve always struggled with mental health, and trust issues due to past relationships and family. I was also r- a year prior. He was the one who helped me feel better and more comfortable. So it hurt me he had lied. I talked to him about a couple things and how belittled it had made me feel.

That makes no sense to me so I was trying to understand that logic.i told him I didn’t mind he did it, it’s not something that has ever bothered me, and I told him that if he had been honest I wouldn’t have been overthinking so much, thinking he disliked me, or maybe the sex was bad, maybe I wasn’t attractive anymore or etc. I said if had told me what he was doing I would have just said oh ok, or apologized for walking in. \n",

      "Title: My (21f) best friend (21f) is an addict and it is ruining everything\n",
      "Body text: Me (21F) and my best friend (21F) have been friends since we were 14 years old, we’ve been through thick and thin together and experienced our teenage years together. She always had an interest in alcohol and weed and she was like the instigator for when we (our friend group) started experimenting with alcohol, like all other teenagers. With my father being an alcoholic, I was always very hesitant and didn’t want to take things too fast, so me and our religious friend were most of the time sober until later when I wasn’t afraid of becoming an alcoholic from one drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was all fine because we only had alcohol and everything was really exciting because it was all so new. Then a few years later she was talking about trying weed and was getting kind of fixated on that. She was talking about how we all should try and how she was trying to get some. I made it very clear that that was something I would never do and I wanted no part in it (seeing as it was illegal and I have a family of alcoholics) I tried to talk her out of it, but I was kind of a spineless teen, but she did it and she thought it was really cool and it was okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "That was of course until she started smoking weed more often, which eventually turned into every day. I asked her to slow down often, but she always replied with the classic “I can stop whenever I want to”. I didn’t notice the personality changes because I was so naive, but she slowly changed and then started getting into more drugs and now more hardcore drugs. (Still no needles that I know of) But she destroyed some lifelong friendships and dropped out of high school to then work full time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our friend group drifted apart and I felt responsible for her, and so about a year ago me and her only other sober friend got her through rehab which was great and she became more of a person again. After rehab she started working again to earn money so she could again live on her own and then she started going to parties again and her boyfriend, which she met in rehab, started taking drugs with her again and smoking weed. What a coincidence. I was strongly against this relationship and they broke up shortly after, but the deed was done. She was in the deep end again and she was driving drunk and under the influence. I help her get help again, but it doesn’t stick. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have had to work out of the country for three months, so I don’t know everything that is going on, but one weekend my sister tells me that my friend was at our house for a morning party. She was there with a lot of bad/influences friends of hers and it was one of her friends that knew of this party, which is how she ended up there. It was a very small private and casual party of my younger brother (18M) and his friends. I only know she was there because my brother told my sister and she told me. I thought it was really strange that she wouldn’t tell me herself that she was at my house partying, but I let it sit for a little more than a week and then I called her and asked her about it. It was all casual, I was just confused as to why she didn’t say anything. She then told me how she and her friends ended up there and how she had a lot of drugs like ketamine with her and when she got home there wasn’t anything left. She said she remembered telling my younger brother that he couldn’t get anything, but she didn’t remember much else. She also told about how there were a lot of very bad people there and my brother shouldn’t be around them and such. She also told how she got a little crazy and started yelling a lot at some guy there and practically ruined the party. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then she asked me if I loved her no matter what and I would never hate her, where I obviously said I could never hate her and such and then she told me she slept with my brother’s best friend (M18). \n",
      "\n",
      "And this doesn’t sit right with me. She feels mostly bad about sleeping with that guy, and she would never have told me about these “bad guys” that were at my brother’s party if I didn’t ask her about it. She wouldn’t have told me that she brought drugs to my house, when she knows my feelings about it and how I want to keep my brother as far away from that as I can. I’m just really hurt and I don’t know if our friendship can recover from this. I have never yelled at her, and I didn’t then either. I’m a very mild person and I hate when people are rude and yell. When she told me this I only said okay and asked about who the guys were and that was it. I don’t know how to proceed from here.\n",

      "Body text: (Alt account so I can speak freely and be anonymous, so I don't have to worry about chaos) \n",
      "\n",
      "As background, I (18 nonbinary) have had very unhealthy relationships in the past that have resulted in some abandonment issues and overall failure to see possible red flags, especially since it's been a year or so since one very toxic relationship of 5 years with a guy who was just very toxic. (won't go into intense detail because it's not the focus) And I'm just starting to better my taste in men. But for the reason of this post, my current partner (18M) who I'll call \"Zed\" (whom I've been with since October 15, 2024 so 6 months though my math could be wrong) is often busy with his future and his creative projects and I know I should give him space but he's also stated he's not that busy and yet I send him a text and I quote \" I love you btw :3\" and nothing for three days! I've overthought it a ton, so I know that he maybe didn't see it yet or forgot to reply because adhd and I do the same a ton, so it could be nothing, but I feel like I'm only important when he needs a distraction or sexual requests. (will not dive deeper into the exact details out of love and respect) and to add to it a little he's very hypersexual(not sure on exact terms but basically very horny a lot and easily) and has stated he doesn't like me just for sex but there are multiple instances where  a hug or cuddle or just existing causes him to be.. 'excited'  and he has R.S.D so I do my best  be clear and direct when I say no that it isn't that I don't love him and \"never wanna touch him because ew\" and on my side I am on the ace spectrum and as of writing this demisexual feels like a good label but basically  I have long periods where I don't want to do sexual stuff especially after school or lunch when I am exhausted and just want to cuddle and recharge and I gave in every time because he'd  be so insistent in a pleading way more than a \"do it now.\" Like forceful, but I know there's something that needs to be discussed, but I just don't have those tools yet for that. But overall all I'm just insecure that I'm just in a watered-down version of that 5-year guy situation, and I don't wanna break up just because \"oh you're 18, just do it, try everyone out, you're young, learn XD\" I want to treat him with respect and figure shit out and learn that way. Especially since he could learn too, maybe, and honestly, TL;DR I just want to know/learn, am I just being paranoid about my feelings of insecurity in the relationship, maybe how to approach certain topics without the answers of \"just leave him lol\" also, we are poly and me and him are dating another guy (18M)that he's been dating longer and I'm just kinda feeling this guy out. This isn't about \"Oh I'm clearly getting less attention and blah blah\", I don't care, I love Zed, and I'm learning if I like our partner, and there is a balance of I'm the new one, of course I'm going to take less priority. That's just how shit works and I love that they love eachother. Hell, if Zed asked to have intimate \"moments\" with another guy, I wouldn't care as long as our partner is cool with it, then all good, I just want him to be safe and happy. Sorry for the long part after, but it's important to know that this dynamic is there, but that isn't why I'm feeling how I am. If that is there and I don't know, then ok. I'll instantly feel better. \"Oh, ok, I'm not being shoved off and ignored, and Yada yada.\" I know we are all very young \"adults\" and are prone to these mistakes or situations all I'm asking is for advice on how to feel better about it and how to handle it maybe and try new things out because I'm only a young human that knows very little on healthy relationships and could use some different views besides this isn't a life changing post it's just a vent and a chance at a healthy discussion on this odd situation that I may not be portraying with 4k detail and exact things again I'm only human. (Sorry if this is too much yapping. I'm writing this on a night of no sleep and am quite tired, with Grammarly to help with punctuation and spelling.)\n",

      "Body text: So, I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years. He is extremely caring and sensitive. He loves me a lot and we never had any arguments. The thing is, I don't feel the same for him anymore. Note: I was never in HONEYMOON PHASE with him, my love for him has grown slowly,so it's not that what's missing. I just feel like I see him more as a friend than a partner.\n",

      "Body text: Hello! I'm looking for some relationship advice.. I'm a 39F and my boyfriend is a 44M. We've been together for 7 years this month. We have children together who are only toddlers. We rent a townhouse and pay bills together and have so for years now. He has a lot of mental issues (anxiety; mainly agoraphobia) that I have been very patient with for years. We live about an hour away from my job and my family/friends. He has never been further than about 10 minutes from our house with me. He used to travel and be much more active in the world years ago, but never when we were together. \n",
      "\n",
      "We meant a bit before COVID hit so when we weren't going out it didn't really bother me, no one was 😅 but it's been years I've been waiting for him to get help (therapy, medication) and even just take basic care of himself (see a primary for basic bloodwork, a dentist for his gum issues, and a cardiologist for his heart issue). Our girls are 17 months old and ever since they were born he has gone downhill when it comes to being present and being helpful in the household (cleaning, laundry, dishes, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "He has childhood trauma issues and mother issues that he refuses to address and I think it plays a part in how he treats the girls and I... he constantly tells me I need therapy, and anger management, and I need to stop smoking, and I need to be more patient with him... I am open and honest about our relationship with family and friends and my therapist; all who believe I am not the one who needs to make changes for us to move forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got engaged over a year ago and about 9 months ago I gave him his ring back and told him I couldn't marry him like this. I work full time and have to raise my girls pretty much on my own and it is exhausting.. I'm just looking for help and get denied most of the time. The past two weekends I have left to go be at my mom's where I get more help and support I need. When it's ok to say \"I've had enough\"? I don't want to feel like a quitter or feel like I gave up on us... I feel like I have given it my all and I am not met with the same sacrifice for our family. He gets upset when we don't have time to watch a 2 hour movie.. I don't think he lives in the same reality I'm in. I'm just confused and looking for opinions, advice, or just kind words. Appreciate you taking the time to read my nonsense; I know everyone has their own drama and troubles. Cheers.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "So I’ve been seeing my (25/M) girlfriend Megan  (24/F) for 4 months now. Slightly under 3 months of being official. I met her about 10 months ago through a good friend who’s now engaged to one of Megan’s best friends. Megan is also a shy and reserved person. I am also her first ever boyfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the beginning of the relationship I’ve noticed she doesn’t initiate any form of physical contact, literally zero. And when it comes to emotional affection, like telling me how she feels about me, she hardly does that and when she has, she was drunk. Or I’ll say something like “I really like you” and she’ll say it back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like 2-3 months ago I asked her if she liked physical affection, like when I grab her hand and stuff, bc I wasn’t sure if she did and if I was over doing it and she said yes she likes it and that I wasn’t over doing it. I was hoping this would make her initiate more but it didn’t at all. I thought I was just being impatient and she needed time in that area so I waited. \n",
      "\n",
      "A month ago her parents were away so I slept over and on the last night of me sleeping over I brought over some wine. We sipped a little bit and halfway through the night I tried to initiate making out and start touching her but after 10 seconds of making out she pulled away so I wasn’t going to try anything the rest of the night. As the night went on she started to drink her wine really fast. Like she wasn’t sipping on it, it was clear she was trying to get drunk. And eventually she asked me to feel the inside of her sweatshirt and then I initiated sex but it rushed and was unsuccessful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This past weekend her parents went away so I slept over 4 nights in a row. I wanted to see if she would initiate anything so I told myself I wasn’t going to be the first one starting physical contact. So for the first 3 nights we did not touch. We did not make out, we did not cuddle, no sex was attempted. We laid in her bed for hours each night and nothing. The only thing she did was prop her phone up against my arm to watch tik tok or we would watch tik toks together. There was literally zero body contact. At the end of the fourth night she said she wasn’t feeling well so I felt bad so I ran my fingers through her hair, rubbed her back and kissed her forehead a few times and leaned my head against hers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m starting to feel pretty frustrated and tired of being the one to initiate any form of physical contact. It doesn’t feel good since it feels one sided and feels like I’m the only one who desires it. I’m not looking for anything over the top but just looking for what I consider to be the barest forms of physical affection. We haven’t made out in like a month, we attempted sex like a month ago which was unsuccessful, and we have never even cuddled. \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I communicate with her without making her feel like she has to show physical affection? Because I truly think nothing will change. I want her to naturally want to touch me and kiss me and want to have sex with me and not do that stuff because she feels like she has to or just because I said something. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: my (25/M) new girlfriend (24/F) does not initiate any form of physical contact. I am the one to initiate everything and it’s wearing on me and I feel undesired and unsure at times. \n",

      "But I just don’t see the effort from her end, I’m left on delivered all day long while she’s scrolling TikTok and Facebook instead of talking to me, doesn’t engage in conversations whenever I start one, and just doesn’t seem excited to talk to me at all. during the day I totally get it, we both have busy lives throughout the day, but yunno i can’t even get 10 minutes out of her day? Seems odd to me\n",

      "Weird part is…when we’re together it’s beautiful, the flow is amazing we have no issues, communicating, talking, doing things. It’s great, just as soon as I’m gone the effort seems like it’s non existent, and yes I’ve brought this up with here multiple times and she thinks I’m Saying her work is getting in the way our relationship, which it’s not at all.

      "And at first she would call me in the mornings while she waited in line to get into work and wanted me to stay on the line with her until she got in, which bothered me because in the mornings I always like to spend a good while away from my phone, with no noise, etc., to the point that on certain occasions I’d say I’d fallen asleep to avoid the call, to the point where it literally started happening that I would fall asleep until after she had already gone in (the latter happened unconsciously); the same thing happened at her lunchtime, when I’m working on my own projects (I work remotely as a 3D animator), and she also wants to tell me about her entire morning and have me there with her the whole time (it’s worth noting that the lunch calls don’t happen every day but do happen fairly often), and then in the afternoons when she leaves work, she calls me from the moment she clocks out until she gets home, and it gets to a point where I feel annoyed because I’m doing my own work or projects and I feel like, “Jesus, I just want to do my own thing,” and I don’t know how to handle it because sometimes she comes off stressed from work and I feel obligated to pay attention to her during the entire hour it takes her to get home or while she’s at lunch… and I feel overwhelmed by all that because I don’t want to make her feel bad but I want to have my own space, and then every night she wants me either to sing to her or talk to her so she can fall asleep since she goes to bed early, and in the evenings I usually play games or watch series with my friends (it’s worth noting that she’s part of my friend group—we’re a group of five who’ve known each other for several years but only recently did she and I enter into this relationship, so very often she plays with us or just pas the time with us)—and it’s not that I don’t like listening to her; in fact, whenever we’re together in person I LOVE listening to her and pay attention to everything she mentions, or when she’s feeling bad and calls me looking for comfort, I do whatever I can to support her, but I feel that so many calls overwhelm me during the day because I feel compelled to give her my full attention for as long as she wants to stay on the call, which is like… JESUS… I get overwhelmed and start to feel anxious to the point that whenever something happens (my lunch arrives, she has something else to do, etc, and we have to cut our call, i feen an immense relief) I don’t want this to become a problem that could damage the beautiful relationship we have… it’s like… literally my only complaint… and I don’t know how to work on it because part of me feels guilty because I don’t want to make her feel bad or anything, it’s not like I don’t care… but at the same time i feel she could tell me all that over a normal chat or at another time… and I don’t know how to work through this….\n",

      "I’m 24M and going through something emotionally messy. I recently ended a 3 year relationship with a 26F that, on paper, was solid—we shared goals like settling down, going overseas, finding good careers, owning a house starting a family one day etc and had a comfortable rhythm. But over time, I realized I didn’t feel like my true self around her.

      "Me (F33) have been in a relationship with my bf (M31) only for a few months. We met on a holiday trip in January, spent an amazing week together (confirmed the relationship on the same day we met, love at first sight) and continued in LDR. The time difference is 9 hours. Our plan was that I’ll go to visit him for a month in May and then he’ll come to my country for 3 months or we’d even get married to stay together in one place (he’s always planning these things more than me). I guess I need to mention that he’s not from a third world country and I’m an attractive woman 😅 so likely it’s not like he’s just using me for is advantage. I’m a Sagittarius and he’s a Pisces, might be important for someone 😄 I have disorientated attachment style (anxious/avoidant), don’t know about he’s but he’s definitely acting like an avoidant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, from the day that we met I was sure he has severe ADHD. He didn’t even know what’s ADHD, lately he’s been researching it and agrees. I mention this because I know ADHD can affect to the emotional regulation, understanding other people’s emotions and keeping up with communication (hyperfocusing in something else, forgetting texts etc). The more we talked the more I was sure about him having that (I’m a psychiatric nurse).\n",
      "\n",
      "He has his own quite new business and is constantly busy with that (he’s working remotely from a computer).\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s had social issues since he was a kid and he doesn’t really have any friends. He says he’s not used to keep in contact with people all the time. At the beginning the communication was probably the best I’ve ever had with anyone, it was so fluent, open and consistent. After a month of LDR it changed very suddenly. I was very confused and couldn’t understand what happened and tried to talk with him about it. I didn’t really get answers and on top of this all, he disappeared for 3 full days. He tried to come back as nothing had happened and I opened up calmly and respectfully but also a little mad, saying I will never ever tolerate anything like this before. After that he communicated very, very honestly and vulnerably with me, saying he’s in a cycle where he works too much and then crashes out and chases dopamine from alcohol, marijuana and pornography. It was a lot for me to digest, but I remained calm and supportive and he said he will stop the substances, and in my understanding he’s actually managed to do so. \n",
      "\n",
      "The communication continued a bit better I guess, I think for 2 weeks we were really digging deep and sharing our thoughts and emotions in a raw way, expressing a lot of love for each other constantly. \n",
      "What happened then, is that out of nowhere after sending me a normal loving text he disappeared again, this time for 2 whole weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first I was mad, then I was worried. We’d been talking about both of our depression and I started to think he’s having a depressive episode. But he really dragged me along with this one, I needed to take a sick leave for 2 weeks because I couldn’t eat, sleep, hardly breath and because of that I lost a lot of money. \n",
      "When he came back, he explained that he had had a lot of stress regarding the business and some other stuff and he wanted to solve the problems first to be able to fully concentrate to our relationship. Some of the things he was dealing with he said he needed to solve so were able to get married without issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get that this is also a thing with a severe ADHD, the person only sees the issues he’s dealing with and can’t consider the emotions of others in his life. For our relationships point of view the things he was dealing with were not big, so he could’ve easily told me about them. Since the beginning I always told him to just tell me if he needs space and I’m glad to give it - please don’t just disappear. It was really hard for me to understand why again he couldn’t do that. He truly didn’t seem to understand the damage he’d caused to me before I told him that I needed time off from work, lost money and that now my bosses know I have some mental health problems (I’ve never needed a sick leave before). He seemed to think that I’ve just lived my life normally and it’s not a problem that I don’t talk with my partner in 2 weeks (I did send him a few supportive messages during that time, because I thought he was isolated and sad). \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of these problems he was dealing with (mostly financial) he asked that I won’t come to visit him on May and instead he’ll come to me already in the middle of May. I agreed to not go to see him because while he was gone I’d already booked another trip for myself for May and will be back on June. He said he’ll come at the beginning of June, but last time we talked he was already postponing it to the middle of June. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this 2 weeks disappearance the things have been alright, he’s put a lot of effort to the relationship. He seems to have extreme stress with the job especially because he’s thinking about fully moving to my country and needs to organize a lot of things. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last week the communication started to feel a bit weaker again, and last Thursday I didn’t hear anything from him on a whole day. That would’ve been fine, I really don’t need to be in contact 24/7, but we’d agreed to have a call on that day since we both were free from work. Also because I had expressed to him at the morning that I miss him even more than usual, it felt a bit cold to not get an answer the whole day. \n",
      "On Friday he explained that he needed some time alone again on Thursday and asked how I was feeling. I send him a longer and loving message explaining my feelings and concerns that our connection is not strong enough for us to start a life together and that I don’t know if he’s needs are being met in this relationship because mine often aren’t. He reacted with a heart to the message but still haven’t answered. \n",
      "He keeps sending some reels on Instagram and yesterday send a message that he misses me, but when I asked if he has time to call during the day he hasn’t even opened the message in the whole day, neither answered. That’s unusual and I find it very disrespectful, he could send me a message in 30 seconds and say he doesn’t have the time on that day and I’d understand. I never complain about him not having time, what I’m concerned about is the lack of communication and connection. \n",

      "It’s only been 2-3 weeks since he came back to life after the 2 weeks disappearance, and already now he can’t send me a simple message if he needs time alone and ignores my question about the call (it’s been 1 week since the last call) and ignores my feelings and concerns that I told him in the longer message.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend makes me feel like his friends are more important. What should I do ?\n",
      "Body text: I’ve (20F) noticed that there have been multiple scenarios where my boyfriend (21M) had chosen his friends over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples: one time we were hanging out with my side of the family for my grandma’s birthday. We rarely go hang out with my side (because we are with his family more) and this time ALL the family was gonna be there. First off, the whole time we were there, he continued to express how much he wanted to go home by asking me, “when are we leaving?” (He asked this more than I would’ve liked that night). And then, like… let’s say it was 1 hour after all this, he tells me the boys (his friends) are going to watch a movie around 8. I tell him we are not going because we’re hanging out with my family, and it’s family I haven’t seen in a while, and family he has never met yet and I would love for him to meet them (my older cousins, my other auntie and uncles, and my nephew and niece’s). He continued to express his wanting to go, so I gave him a solution where I said, “we can watch the movie tomorrow if you really wanna go. Just you and me.” I thought that would’ve made him happy, but his response was, “well I wanted to go today because the boys are going.” That already gave it away that he wanted to go be with them, even though we’re celebrating my grandma. In the end, he ended up leaving that night to go be with his friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example is: he used to tell me “I’m coming over after work.” Or “can I come over.” And of course I’d say yes. And when the time comes, he says, “I’m going home to play games with the boys.” Now don’t get me wrong. If he wants to play with them, he can. I don’t care. What gets me here, is he ALREADY told me he was coming, but now, he’s not because of the boys and game. It was okay the first time, but he continued to do it again and again. Making me believe that he was gonna come over to spend time with me, just to say never mind. No matter how many times I expressed myself to him about this, he still did it. Why ? Because the boys ask him to get on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last example: he defends his friends just fine, but when it comes to me, he suddenly “doesn’t know how.” There was this time he told me he was at work, and he works with 2 of his friends, and one of my cousins. They were talking about their girlfriends and what gets them mad or upsets them. He then told me my cousin said something about me (which I will not go in details with) and I was really offended by it. I then asked him what he said, and he told me he just said, “well it’s okay because I wanna do it too.” I then talked about my cousin and how he shouldn’t be talking about me like that and such and that I was offended, and right away, he was defending my cousin and trying to make it seem like what he said, was okay. I then told him why he didn’t defend me like this when my cousin said what he said, and his response was, “it’s your cousin. I can’t be rude.” (Keep in mind, they’ve been friends longer than we even started dating. They’ve been friends since middle school. We starting dating last year). I was hurt by this and just so confused. There have been like 2-3 times after this, that he did the same thing. But yesterday we got in a little argument. And while arguing, I mentioned a friend. “Why don’t you just go talk and be with ___. You continue to talk about how nice and sweet he is.” I don’t know what it was, but he was really triggered by that. His replies were, “what does he have to do with this.” And the one that really got me, “don’t say his name.” I told him it wasn’t an insult and such, and he says, “insult or compliment, don’t say his name.” Like oh. I know that there wasn’t really any point in bringing up a friend of his, but the way he told me to not bring him up and to not say his name, that’s what got to me. I then begun to tell him why he can’t be like this to his friends when they talk about me, and he says, “when you have friends like me, you’ll understand. But you don’t, so you have no place to say all this.” Like okay. Yes, I don’t have friends like him, but still. That whole part in the argument, he just kept telling me it’s because he has friends, and I don’t…  \n",
      "\n",
      "Those were the examples, and I continue to express to him that it’s clear there are many times he’s done this, and clear they are #1 on his list, but he keeps saying they’re not, and I just don’t believe it. I see and feel the love he has for me, but the love and care he has for his friends are much more than the love and care he has for me. His girlfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea what to do, and no idea what else to say to him that would express it hurts me at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR : my boyfriend chooses/defends his friends over me sometimes. One time he went to watch the movies with them Instead of being with my family we haven’t seen in a while. (And we were already there. He left the birthday party). He would tell me he’s coming over, but say never mind because he wants to go on the game with the boys. He would always defend them but when it comes to me, he doesn’t. I feel like they’re more important than me.\n",

      "Body text:   Ok so I(f-15) met this kid(m-17)  in early October of '24(he was 16 at the time) on an online group chat (don't judge). We got to talking, realized we had similar interests and we grew into a close friendship. I somehow ended up getting feelings for him early to mid November and our other friends started \"shipping\" us and telling us/saying we'd be cute together. I tried shutting the idea down but he didn't, or at least not really. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Eventually by the end of December/early January I had gotten slightly obsessed with him or close enough at least. I had told my closer friends about him and the feeling I had for him and my closest friend(f-15) kinda cheered me on but also had my back when everything went downhill. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Around late January/early February, me and him had grown sorta distant, he had stuff happening in his life and I was letting him have his needed space. I was a lil scared or nervous to reach out to him...his parents weren't (and still kinda aren't to my knowledge) fully ok or aware of us talking or him talking to anyone online. Which is reasonable but it caused him to basically disappear without a word for weeks at a time frequently and worry me and a bunch of other people, including our mutual close friends . \n",
      "\n",
      "  In early March, I took a break from our shared group chat and had already kinda been ignoring his messages beforehand. About a week later when I had returned to the shared group chat, no one even really noticed I had left and it kinda annoyed me but I could've been overreacting. \n",
      "\n",
      "  I had left the chat again sometime in the last week of March and didn't join back until like last week. meaning I was gone for a good month or so. He barely realized I was back until 2-ish days after I'd rejoined. We haven't talked to each other much since. \n",

      "I feel like I’ve completely hit some sort of wall and I can’t figure out how to fix the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t live together but spend most of our time together at my place. He’ll be here for weeks since he has all his essentials here, and only goes home in case he needs to pick something up from there or wants some time apart. We’re thankfully both similar in the sense that we need alone time after being together for long stretches, but the last month has been very different. I’ve felt terrible around him and I don’t exactly know why. My libido has completely tanked and I feel like I don’t even have any interest towards him, as he’s tried to initiate sex a couple time the last week and I’ve had to turn him down due to just a complete lack of interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel terrible about it. I want to be close to him, but I feel some sort of repulsion at the thought of having sex. This was not the case before.

It never bothered me before and I was very happy to see him satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the things which I feel may possibly have contributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I do all the cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping. He offers to pay for groceries sometimes when we go shopping together, but I struggle with accepting it. Before we even started dating, he made a point to let me know that he’s stingy and doesn’t like spending money. We go 50/50 on activities and eating out. I’m a people pleaser but I also earn more than him, so I don’t have any qualms with covering the costs. The trouble is, he’s told me that he feels like he’s not contributing enough, which makes him unhappy. I feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place - if I let him pay for things, then I’ll be an unjust burden on him, but when I pay he feels emasculated for it.\n",
      "* We’ve had some issues in the bedroom since the beginning. He’s got a bit of a porn addiction. There was one instance when I initiated sex, but he told me he’d masturbated multiple times before coming over, so he wasn’t going to be able to perform. I explained that I felt hurt because it made me feel like I can’t satisfy him, which he assured me wasn’t the case. He claims that the two are very different for him, and sometimes he just craves doing it alone. He’s so used to the porn that I haven’t ever been able to make him climax myself. This is also something that is causing me anguish and I often feel like I’m inadequate. I have tried a great deal of different things, he’s very happy with them generally, but unable to finish regardless. Sometimes I feel like I’m competing with the women that he sees in porn. It’s not a competition I can win, so I feel gutted. In a perfect world, he wouldn't need the porn at all, but I know it's unrealistic to ask that of him. I just hate feeling like the less preferable backup option.\n",
      "* The biggest problem for me is that it’s very difficult for the both of us to actually talk about these issues. He completely shuts down when he’s upset; I might as well be talking to a wall. I love him and genuinely care about him, so of course I don’t want to upset him, which means we don’t really talk about these issues and my feelings properly. Any serious talks we do have usually make us both feel worse than before, or just upset him to the point where I need to console him, leaving me feeling unheard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don’t know what to do. I want to rekindle the feelings of affection and desire I had for him not long ago, but I don’t know how to approach it. I’ve been looking at some options for couples therapy, but we would both prefer to handle this by ourselves. The therapy is very expensive and I’m hesitant to invest in it, assuming we’re able to fix the issues ourselves. At the same time, I need to act now and not leave the issues bubbling under the surface. I don't want either of us to start building up resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I approach these difficult conversations while being gentle with him? I understand that being overly kind to the point of ignoring the problems isn’t doing us any favors. I have to admit that I’ve had thoughts about ending the relationship, but this is not a serious consideration and not what I actually want. I just want to feel seen and understood.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend lied to my face today. Can we continue?\n",
      "Body text: I (23F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for quite a while, but our relationship has an atypical timeline. We met in October 2023 and majorly hit it off and started dating (but not gf/bf). I was set to move abroad for exchange in January 2024, and I let him know near the beginning of us knowing each other. I didn’t want anything to get too serious before I left in order to protect my feelingsy, if he moved on while I was away, or if I met someone while I was on exchange. In April 2024, I sent him a postcard because I missed him and we started talking every single day. This continued and I was reunited with him on September 1, 2024. So basically we were talking every day, FaceTiming usually multiple times a week for hours, but we had no official title. He even asked me out while I was abroad, but I said no due to cold feet and not seeing him for so long.\n",
      "Fast-forward today, May 1, 2025. We’ve been officially exclusive since September. It’s been fantastic up until today. Yesterday, he helped me move out of my apartment and put my things in his basement to store over the summer. I’m leaving to go home for the summer, but will be back in September when I move into a new apartment. I have issues with retroactive jealousy, which is important to know for this. I’ve also been having a female issue (if you know what I mean) and my symptoms mean it could be an STD. Both of us got tested in September (my rule) so I should be okay. But it was hanging over my head that maybe he hadn’t had something that didn’t show on the tests or manifested later. Anyways, I asked him straight up if he had slept with anyone while I was on exchange. He said no, and I asked him again telling him that it was okay if he did because we werent in a committed relationship. He told me no again. He told me that he loves me and has never cheated on me and I asked to go through his phone. There was nothing there. Then, we’re about to bake brownies when I had an epiphany - his old phone was sitting on his desk. So I went to it, turned it on and looked at the text with several girls that he hooked up with in August alone. Although we weren’t exclusive, I’m still extremely hurt. The worst part? He lied straight to my face before we went for dinner with his parents, and after when I asked him again. I can’t get over that he lied to me and deceived me by deleting all of his messages with them.\n",
      "Upon confrontation, he explained that he didn’t want to tell me because he knew that it would upset me. I agreed but reminded him that I was asking for health concern. He told me that he’s been faithful and is very certain that he only wants me in his life forever. He cut all of those girls off before I got back. But it makes me question the sincerity of everything. Also, I understand he was lonely but him seeing other girls while talking to me every day is very hurtful. \n",
      "Did I mention I have to stay at his house and I’m flying to my hometown tomorrow? He has to go to work in the morning and then was supposed to come to pick me up and take me to the airport.\n",
      "What the hell do I do? Do I give him another chance or do I just end it now and enjoy my summer single? I also don’t know what to do about the airport issue tomorrow and fact that long distance would start. \n",

      "\n",
      "Fairly soon after we starting dating there were a lot of breakdowns, involving her thinking she was mean, ugly, \"a bad person\", convinced I hated her, and only long, careful discussions seemed to help. She has picked at her skin until it bleeds the entire time I've known her, can get very angry if plans change suddenly, and when we hang out with friends, is generally in a quiet, sullen mood. She struggles with self-image, and until recently, ran 4 miles every morning for several years leading to stress fractures and muscle strains. We would try to cook together, but if it wasn't her method she would get extremely stressed and convinced it would turn out horrible. After a few months of this, I suggested she look into therapy. However, she's a very frugal person, and convinced that an unexpected catastrophe could leave her penniless, so after much convincing she was only open to the one provided at her corporate job.\n",
      "\n",
      "This therapist was helpful and she enjoyed the sessions, but since their intended purpose was for short-term work related problems, they suggested she look for something more long-term related to OCD. This was a year ago now, and though I've been trying to be understanding it seems like she's dragging her feet and delaying. There's been dozens of tearful discussions about it, but from her perspective it feels like I'm being controlling and saying that unless she goes to a therapist, we can't move forward.

For context, he used to be in a situationship with one of my friends and then they fell out terribly. He is a known player and doesn't have the greatest reputation. On the other hand, I have never had a bf or even had a crush in HS. I was bullied a lot in school (particularly by boys my age) and therefore always feel defensive and in general closed off to them.

We have a very understanding relationship, we love each other deeply. However, I have a goal of settling down by the age of 27 or 28 (2030 approx).

      "Medical studies in India were turning out to be expensive so he decided to pursue it from a not so popular tropical country beginning from 2020. The degree there is in the form of BS-MD which means that after 1 year of pre-med course in India, he would have to shift to that country for his MD course. However, due to covid, his 1st year was conducted online and was only able to go in the second year of his course. The govt of India passed a circular which disallowed this online format and he will have to stay back in that country for some more time. basically, he will have to appear for his FMGE in  the December 2026 duration. And after that he must apparently intern for a year to get his final license. He will get to appear for NEET PG in 2028 because that happens only in June. Fortunately, if he secures a good rank and college, he might start earning but very meagre. \n",

We could not afford vacations, fancy meals and were always on the budget. I will start earning soon but my parents and I would have preferred that I get married into a well settled family so that I would not have to go through the same financial hardships as they went through. Considering that medical students start earning a significant amount of money much later than other professions, I am having second thoughts about this relationship. Because by the time I want to be married, my boyfriend will have started earning recently (if things go our way). Our timelines are not matching and I would like to get some adult's advice, especially if someone in their late 20s/ early 30s in the medical profession can help me out by giving me a clear picture about his profession. \n",

      "My best friend confessed his feelings for me. I think I feel the same but I have some reservations about it. I’m unsure how to proceed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I met him about 10 years ago on the internet. Even though we only ever met in person once my senior year of high school he became my best friend. He is the one person I can be my true self with. I feel like I don’t have to hide anything. I can tell him anything and he knows everything about me. We’ve been through so many ups and downs together. It has been an amazingly beautiful experience to watch him grow as a person and see how far he has come in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a month ago we decided to meet up in person. I was worried our bond wouldn’t translate well from behind a screen to in person and it would be awkward. That was far from the truth. We hit it off so well that it was like being physically with each other was just natural, like our friendship has been this way the whole time. We started making plans to make regular hang outs as we really don’t live that far, only a 3 hour drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all sounds really good right? Well, we may have hit it off a little too well. We decided to end the night by watching a movie. About halfway through we started cuddling. At the end of the movie he kissed me and confessed his feelings for me. I know he had a crush on me as teenagers but I thought it had fizzled out over the years. News flash to me, it did not, he was in love with me this entire time, I was just oblivious. After the kiss and confession of love we ended up having sex. This was a mistake. I think? I am not entirely sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the part where I’m gonna sound like a really shallow person. He is the perfect guy for me. If soulmates existed that is the term I would use. I love and care for him deeply. There is just a couple problems. He’s shorter than me and not conventionally attractive. Which I know doesn’t matter. I don’t really care about looks, but height had always been a deal breaker for me. I want to feel protected when I am held and I don’t get that feeling when the man is smaller than me. I know it sounds terrible. There’s also the issue of his own mental illness, he’s bipolar. As his friend it can be exhausting to deal with at times. It takes a lot out of me mentally. I can only imagine that would be worse dating him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know I’m really confused about my feelings right now. I want to date but at the same time I have my reservations. He is not confused at all and wants to jump all in with me, already making plans for our future. I’m scared if we start a romantic relationship it will ruin our friendship. I’m also scared that we cannot go back to being friends after this and I’ll break his heart and he won’t be able to continue being friends with me. He has already stated that he cannot go back to seeing me as just a friend and he doesn’t think he’d be able to stay in contact with me as it would be too difficult.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We watched a play together and the theme was death and the importance of building connections with people around you. As we left the theater, there was a man, maybe 60s, with a can that was holding the door, I asked him if he wanted me to grab the door or needed any help. The man said no and my boyfriend and I went on our way. Immediately after, my boyfriend said in a teasing tone that was weird, I asked him why, and he said we just watched a okay about death and you ask an old guy if he needs help. I responded I was just trying to be kind. I don’t know why but it rubbed me the wrong way. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Another time I told him a story that brought me a little joy. I was heading to the gym early morning and saw police cadets doing their training. One was lagging behind and on her own with one of the officers. I was stopped at a light so I roll down my window and said to be encouraging, you got this, keep pushing, you can do it! She gave me a nod. When I told my boyfriend this he mocked me and said again it was weird and I was basically like “ooohh look at her she’s the weak one of the cadets” and I said no I felt compelled in the moment to say those words and was trying to be nice and encouraging. Again, am I weird for rolling down my window and saying that? Writing this, I actually feel like I was trying to share a nice little story and he was being critical of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The last example is maybe related to my bd is for connection. I have a very child like wonder for the world, and like to say, “oh look at that! How cool!” Or I’ll say, you want to know something really cool I just saw” and sometimes he’ll say no I don’t want to hear it, or when I point something out, doesn’t really respond too much. Recently we were walking, and he said “oh look at that!” And I responded “what, where?” only to realize there was nothing and he was poking fun at me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have a lot of dating experience and this has been my longest relationship so far. My question is, what can I do so that I feel more comfortable sharing stuff with him and not be scared I’m being met with negativity? Am I being obnoxious when I share these things, should I dial back? I just don’t understand why I’m always met with some form of negativity. \n",

      "For starters me {22F}  and bf {24M} have known each other for 2 years now and been together for almost a year. Back story, in t he beginning we hung out a lot and were spending so much time together and we kissed and started saying I love you before he even asked me to be his gf. When I asked him about it, he said it will come just wait. I would wait and still not be asked, I would set it up so we can go somewhere cute to hangout and hoped that he would and he wouldn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "After every place we went to, I would say wow so today is not the day. After a while we went to see the tulips which I proposed the idea and made happen. It was then when he asked me to be his girlfriend after almost a full year of hanging out and acting like a couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to present time, we are long distance since July of 2024 i like to point out, a  few months ago we brought up our anniversary and I forgot the full conversation but the important things is he finally confessed that he wouldn't have even asked me to be is gf then and i forced and pressured him into doing it. That left a sour taste in my mouth. He said he he isn't fully committed bc I didn't let him do it naturally. That felt like our whole relationship is a lie.  I got upset and told him to scrap it all. proposed a solution to start over and he said no he wants to keep the original \"anniversary\" date. He then said he did mean it that day. So now I am confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when our supposed \"anniversary\" is coming up for being together for a year, I have brought it up several times and shown how much that fake anniversary meant to me. I expressed how I wanted him to come visit me since I have visited him twice. He would say \"year we'll see\" but never try to plan anything or save for a visit. He says he's tight on money and this and that and I have offered to cover the hotel and everything when he gets here since he'll only be here for three day and two nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "we just got into a fight and he saying I should visit him since its cheaper then him coming here and I should go be there but our anniversary is next weekend. For the longest time, he didn't even remember our fake anniversary date and didn't mark it down in his calendar. He says he is not fully committed and had commitment issues but I met his family. We did couple things and now knowing it was all fake, two years have been wasted and for nothing. I don't feel like our anniversary date is real hence why I call it fake. He is not trying to come to celebrate our one year together. well I guess now since it isn't real, it wouldn't matter anymore\n",
      "\n",
      "What do i do? I want to stay with him but I also feel like I wasted two years and the last year of us being 'official' is fake. I don't feel like his gf but it is confusing because again we spent so much time acting like a couple only seeing each other and if I talked to even a friend who is a guy from high school, he would get upset. But now after hearing the truth of it all and him not trying to actively wanting to come and prioritizing coming for our fake anniversary, I don't feel like he is my bf and I am not his gf.\n",

      "TL;DR : My long distance boyfriend of one year (known and been getting to know each other of 2) revealed that when he asked me to be his gf, he felt forced and pressured but for a long time he made me think it was genuine. I feel like our whole relationship so far has been forced and a lie. Our \"anniversary\" is now coming up and it feels like there are plans of coming to celebrate which ended up in an argument.  I feel like two years have been wasted and I am unsure what to do.  Should we start over? If we do how do I just forget the past two years. How do you even start over? \n",

      "Title: My (21F)boyfriend (22M) doesn’t want to see me\n",
      "Body text: Me (21F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been dating for over a year now. Since the very beginning of our relationship, I’ve always felt that I put more effort into seeing him and spending quality time together than he has. Recently, we had an argument about this because we’ve been seeing each other only once a week for the past two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference: I have an 8–4 job, am a full-time student, and also work another job from home in my free time. He’s currently unemployed and has university classes three times a week. In the past months, he had a virus infection (often headaches, fever) but still attended uni despite being sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have mostly only been seeing each other once a week, usually during the weekend, but we never go out on dates. It’s usually either attending family events together or me staying over at his parents’ house with him. The last time we went on an actual date was in February (this is being written at the end of April), and he hasn’t taken me out to dinner once. When we do go out, it’s usually just grabbing a drink and going home after an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "His university is eight minutes away from my workplace and dorm, but he visited me only two or three times in the last two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "This issue has been a constant in our relationship, so when I brought it up again recently, it wasn’t anything new. He gave several reasons why he doesn’t come out to see me or spend time with me: •\tHe feels under the weather. While this is understandable and I don’t get upset if he says he feels ill, it still hurts knowing he can attend university and play video games but doesn’t make the effort to see me. •\tIt’s inconvenient to drive up to me. On the two days he doesn’t have uni, he finds it too time-consuming and expensive to drive 20–30 minutes (depending on traffic), even though the round trip only costs about $5. •\tIt’s inconvenient to wait for me. Since I work until 4 PM every day and his classes end at either 5, 1, or 2 PM, he says it’s too much time wasted to wait for me to finish work. On days when his classes end earlier, he feels he has nothing to do for 2–3 hours. In my view, he could spend the time seeing friends, going to the store, or simply waiting at my place.\n",
      "\n",
      "These patterns are not new. Even last year, when he didn’t have a car yet, he often complained about taking the bus to visit me, as the bus ride back home took 1–1.5 hours, and he preferred to go to the gym or do school work instead. Sometimes he even said that seeing me simply didn’t cross his mind, although he did not mean this maliciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we do meet on weekends, it usually involves going to his family’s house or attending family events. He doesn’t feel comfortable at my dorm, even though it’s clean and nicely kept, because he finds it too small. This results in me spending most weekends at his place, surrounded by his family, which limits our alone time. Although his family is great, I sometimes feel I’m missing the privacy and comfort of our own space.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that I have been carrying this part of the relationship since the beginning. I expressed that I expect changes because I want to feel like a priority, not an option. I wish to be taken out spontaneously, to be told: “Hey, tomorrow I’m taking you out, be ready at 7.” This seems like a normal desire in a romantic relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I mention that he doesn’t make active efforts to see me, he argues that if he always had to wait 2–3 hours, drive to me, plan dates, pay for them, and bring flowers, the effort would not be equal. He questions how this would benefit him. From my perspective, making each other happy and spending quality time together should be enough of a reason.\n",

      "I could really use some advice about a situation with my boyfriend of 3 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had a very up-and-down relationship in the past. There are a lot of emotional fights, and huge stress caused by my chronic health problems. Even though there is real love between us, things often could often feel unstable and unsafe.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, he proposed, but it felt impulsive and noncommittal, more of an emotional reaction than a carefully thought-out plan. At one point he stated before this that if he didn’t propose with a ring, then it wasn’t real. He proposed with a cute silly little ring I made out of paper. It was really sweet. But it was also much earlier in the relationship for a proposal than I was expecting. I said yes, but also thought we should still take more time to live together and make sure we are compatible before tying the knot. We also had yet to tell anyone, so publicly we were just boyfriend/girlfriend. He agreed, but would sometimes only refer to me as his girlfriend in private when annoyed with me. That left me feeling like I couldn’t fully trust that he was thinking long-term. We’ve continued like this for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also lived together for a while, and honestly, many of our worst fights stemmed from the stress of trying to share a bedroom.\n",
      "He has moderate sleep apnea at a relatively young age and it made nighttime a huge challenge. He would often fall asleep mid-sentence without saying goodnight or letting me settle in, and the snoring made it difficult for me to get any rest at all.\n",
      "It created a lot of resentment on both sides — I felt ignored and physically exhausted, and he felt guilty but frustrated that he couldn’t control it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested solutions like having separate bedrooms (the way many older couples do), but because of space limitations where we lived, that just wasn’t possible. This combined with my chronic health issues left me feeling alone after 8pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, we had the worst fight we have ever had.\n",
      "I was feeling ill again, combined with a terrible migraine affecting my ability to think and speak. He had taken off work to go shopping with me in the morning and then have time to himself. I was struggling to get with it, and he became increasingly annoyed. I tried to take vitamins, splash cold water on my face and down a Tylenol to get with it, but it wasn’t working. I needed more time. He got mad that this happens so often, and my flares have been getting worse. I recently lost my job due to it, putting even more of a strain on things as I job hunt. I’m not sure how the fight escalated (I was pretty out of it) but he stormed off and locked himself in his office. I spoke to him through the door when I should have given him space. I didn’t understand why he was so mad at me. He got more frustrated, calling me a “dumb b****” out of anger. That set me off. He can’t say things like that, and it had become increasingly common during fights. He ended up storming out of the office, aggressively pushing me out of his way as he stormed out of the house, telling me to “f*** off out of his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I left to be with what family was around, couch hopping for a few days at the expense of my health before we talked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He apologized (though maybe not yet as much as I need him to) for what he did. He said he was out of line and wants to be together. His biggest need though, is to be closer to his support system, located mostly in another state on the opposite side of the country. I agree that’s important, but I also have reservations understandably.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed we still love each other and want a real future, but also that we need to do things differently this time. What I want is to stay together and rebuild slowly. I want to be exclusive, emotionally connected, and supportive while doing long distance for a while. I want to work on healing my body, saving money, and possibly starting school (my program is partly in-person, but will shift to online later, making moving easier when I’m ready). I want the chance to visit the new state a few times, get comfortable, and make sure I’m moving into a healthy situation, not just chasing love and hoping for the best. We’re giving each other some breathing room while working toward rebuilding trust, starting couples counseling and individual therapy, and really healing physically and emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s decided to move to the other state soon to be closer to his friends. He expects that eventually, I would join him there.\n",
      "I love him and I want to be with him, but right now I don’t feel ready to uproot my life. My entire current support system is here — my family, my friends, my doctors — and they’re all very against this move. Some of their judgment feels fair, but a lot of it feels angry, harsh, and almost like they’re pushing their own fears onto me. Perhaps they are seeing something I am unable or unwilling to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also have this lingering worry: when we were separated briefly, it felt like even the mutual connections we have where he’s moving wouldn’t have been there for me if I needed help. It makes me wonder — if something went wrong, would I be completely alone? He apologized to get me back after the breakup, but the fact that he has abandoned me more than once still sticks with me. I’m scared it could happen again, especially if I have no one else nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part is I think he wants a firm yes or no now. I’m worried that if I ask for this time, he’ll feel rejected or impatient, and end things entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him, and I truly want a life with him. But I don’t want to repeat the same mistakes by rushing into another situation where I’m isolated, unstable, and sacrificing everything just to “prove” my commitment. Maybe I need him to prove his?\n",

      "Title: Partner protects best friend over me\n",
      "Body text: I am 25F, I’ll be clover, my partner is 26F, Jess.3yr relationship. Since the beginning Jess has had a weird dynamic with her best friend Tay. I’m gonna go through some instances that have rlly been stuck in my mind, and make me feel sad and not prioritized. Apologies in advance bc there is A LOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the start, Jess would cancel plans with me when Tay wanted to see them - I was trying to be a cool gf so I let it happen (it was stupid of me, I know). One night, I was really struggling and needed Jess, she came but left in the morning to see Tay because Tay was anxious. I felt tossed aside. \n",
      "\n",
      "At a get together, Tay grabbed my partners hand and said“I wonder if this will make clover jealous”.  Tay would also use pet names like “my love”. I told Jess to pls talk to Tay about it, and she said that’s the friendship but she would talk to her if it came up - it took 6 months for it to happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would talk to Jess about how uncomfortable Tay made me, and I was reassured that it was just a friendship and they are just lovey.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Over a year into the relationship) Jess started uni, and. Tay joined and took every single class with my partner. Odd right? I worked a lot, so I loved texting my gf to check in, as we didn’t get to see eachother as much. They’d disappear for hours and then later say oh yeah I was with Tay - I asked them to please let me know when they would see her because I got anxious. Jess agreed. Jess would also text Tay everyday after school … they were already seeing eachother everyday at school so why need constant communication with her. Jess said it’s just school stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comes international bf day, I make a post about my gf, ofc. But to my surprise, Tay also posted Jess with a picture where Jess was on her lap. This threw me over the edge. I told Jess it’s very uncomfortable and it seems that Tay sees Jess as a partner and Jess is happily filling that role. Jess just said “it’s weird but how is Tay supposed to know that she can’t make those posts, she didn’t mean harm she probably thought it was funny”. This felt invalidating, and excusing Tays actions - like Tay is not stupid. I wanted Jess to talk to Tay about it. Jess only jokingly told Tay “you aren’t my bf silly” after Tay was upset that Jess didn’t like her post. I would’ve liked a more serious conversation like “hey this makes my partner uncomfortable, we are not dating so please don’t act as if we were in a relationship, we are friends, so these are some boundaries I want to establish with you….”. But Jess didn’t want to make Tay uncomfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked Jess if they could try to take classes without Tay for the next semester. They agreed. And that I wanted Jess to establish boundaries, but Jess didn’t want to push Tay away so a conversation never happened. We would go back to the cycle of Jess not telling me when she saw Tay - I repeated what I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, they had been seeing each other between classes everyday. Of course I didn’t find this out until I saw texts. Jess didn’t think it was a big deal because it was only for 10-15 minutes. I explained that to me it was a big deal because its odd to need to see eachother everyday single day. (Side note: at the start of our relationship, Jess and I would find small times to see eachother when we got busy days - so these small meet ups had significance to our relationship). Jess apologized and again promised to tell me.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.5 years in) Jess placed some unsaid boundaries with Tay- I appreciated this. Tay got a bf and stopped reaching out to Jess. Whenever we talk about this situation jess feels that she “completely iced out” Tay- which is kinda blaming me for the fact that Tay didn’t see Jess like she used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Tay would be moving to a different city. Tays mom told Jess that she needed to be seeing Tay before she moved - even though it was Tay that didn’t reach out to Jess. I told my partner it wasn’t her fault but they disagreed and thought it was because of the boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month later, I went to Mexico for a week to spread my grandmas ashes. Jess and I stayed in contact. Jess told me about one of her meetings with Tay, it felt good to know that my partner was maintaining connection even when we are away from eachother. Later the day before my gmas ceremony, Jess says that another friend Kurt is going over to our house. I don’t hear from Jess until 2am, and said “oh yeah Tay came, sorry I forgot to tell you”. I honestly couldn’t deal with it, I stopped talking to Jess the rest of the trip. Jess knew how awful I was feeling bc of my gma, and she had so much time to tell me that Tay was going to be there too. This confirmed that I could not trust Jess when it came to Tay. Although they are friends, I felt emotionally cheated on, why am I being lied to, why does Jess continue protecting Tays feelings but not mine. After I came back from the trip, they apologized and said that it was really messed up what they did and it won’t happen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Over 2 years in) after Tay moved - we were in such a good place, I no longer had to worry of secrets. But, I started thinking… if Jess cared about my emotions then she would’ve made changes while Tay was in town but it took Tay moving cities and getting a bf for something to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tay visited a couple times, but didn’t really reach out to Jess but would see other friends. I told Jess that\n",
      " Was shitty behaviour. But Jess disagreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can’t shake off that resentment, and I keep thinking about how awful I felt during such a large portion of our relationship. For the past month, emotions have been magnified because I’m in a high stress state because I’m studying for the MCAT and working and volunteering. During this we have been sharing a car, and I have asked Jess multiple times to let me know the plans in advance so I don’t have to stop my plans bc she needs the car. Similar to Tay, there’s a plan for a bit and then it stops and I have to keep reminding Jess that I need communication. I told Jess this reminded me of the Tay situation and that I’m still hurt by it. She apologized and says they wish they could change the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been emotionally and physically distant, it’s hard for me to close to jess again. I know it’s wrong of me to push her away, but I don’t know how to overcome this feeling of betrayal - I don’t want to keep pretending that we are good. Sometimes we have good days, but I just keep going back to the same feeling. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been more on edge than usual because Tay is visiting for a while. FYI it’s Saturday today. On Monday, Tay showed up to Jess’s work - Jess told me after but I spiraled wondering if there was something I sent being told. I did something toxic, and looked at texts. Tay checked Jess location before going to see her. That made me feel better that it wasn’t planned but still uncomfortable. Jess says that Wednesday they are hanging out with Tay. Im emotionally out at this point. Jess has a coworker bday party at Kurt’s house last night, she invited me to join but I couldn’t socialize so I stayed home. I’m at home, overthinking, so I am toxic once again and I check texts on iPad… turns out Tay was invited and I was not told.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Jess gets home, I asked if Tay was there why was I \n",
      "told to join, why was I not told of Tay. Jess said she knew I wasn’t going to go, and didn’t think she needed to tell me and that we should be over it by now - even though we talked about it a week ago. Jess thinks I’m just waiting for them to make a mistake and it bothers them. Maybe part of me is looking for the bad, but I have been asking to be kept in the loop (which I don’t think is too much) and I keep being lied to. Jess also says she didn’t say because she didn’t wanna ruin the good moments we have had but each time I’m not being told pushed me away. I want to trust them, but it’s been so many times that that trust is broken. I can’t just hand that trust back without seeing consistent change.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended the conversation by looking for couples therapists.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think? What should I do? How can I make them see that their actions hurt me? Is it that S doesn’t care enough about my emotions? Am I asking to much? \n",

Today I said to him in a very delicate way that I feel I do most of the chores. And the hell is out... I am used to talk things through, from my x-husband. But my partner just leaves the room, starts fixing things, dont talk to me, and then later says that he wants to leave me, that I deserves better. Its not in my nature to hold a angry person back, but I am not sure where I have him, so I dont take the chance, and I beg for him to stay. I dont know what to think and feel. I cannot live with him being so bad in resolving conflicts. And I know my self, I will soon just look at him when he starts, and say: go, I dont need you. I have no idea if he will come back or not. And I have not been willing to take the risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been looking so much forward to my father moving, and it is the solution to many of our problems. We will have more space to store all of our junk, more privacy and dont have to clean after him. But now I am not sure if letting my partner buy the house is a good idea. What if he does something like this again in a few months? Maybe I will loose the house.... Have to sell it and move into a small appartment. I cant afford it by my self. My kids really like him, and I love him. Its only when he is feeling really down that he gets in that mood. Normally we can talk about things as adults. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:  My partner is not good at talking when we have a conflict and he is feeling sick/sleepy/depressed at the moment of the conflict. He always says he wants to leave me. We have a really great relationship 99% of the times. This happens maybe 2 times a year.  Should I let him buy my fathers part of the house so we will have more privacy and less stress. Or is it too risky if he wants to leave me again? \n",

      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 9 months and we have been really struggling for the last few weeks. He is very codependent and sensitive to anything negative I bring up. He also doesn’t really have any hobbies outside of talking to me so anytime I can’t talk to him for little while, he gets really depressed. Anytime I do something he doesn’t like or try to talk to him about any issues, he breaks down completely. Sometimes he really is upset, but I know that most of the time is heavily exaggerated. \n",
      "\n",
      "One time I told him that he was guilt-tripping me, and he immediately broke down crying in my lap and kept asking me if he “really did that” until I finally just told him “no” and he then stopped crying completely. Another time, he told me he was scared of the dark and I was standing right beside the light switch so I flicked the lights on & off (I was just trying to poke fun at him, I really wasn’t trying to be mean. And the lights were only off for a few seconds). He immediately got into the fetal position and started crying. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of how sensitive he is, I feel like I can’t bring up anything to him. He has autism and I’m really his first real relationship, so I don’t think he really knows what is & isn’t appropriate behavior.

      "I really need to talk to him about what he’s doing and how it’s affecting me but I’m afraid when I tell him that I feel like I can’t tell him anything because of how upset he gets, he will think I’m just telling him to bottle everything up.

      "Me 18M and my boyfriend 19M had been dating for over a year and half before one night we both ended things one night. We maintained contact for the most part after and not even two weeks later we got back together because we both really do love one another. During that time I did my best to bury the feelings and love that I had for him (even though I knew the thought of him not wanting us to try again upset me a LOT). During this time I also devalued him in my mind (only looked at the bad parts of the relationship instead of keeping the mix of good and bad up in my head.) and also spoke to friends that didn’t like him and perpetuated a negative image of him to me. To cut to the chase , I KNOW that I love him but the feeling of being IN love with him isn’t there right now (I really hope that makes sense). Also!! The things that previously were making me unhappy the past time we dated has been resolved and a lot of it was me not willing to admit that I wasn’t okay with what was going on, so the reason essentially we broke up mutually is no longer a factor. I came here to see if anyone had advice on how we can fix this and if it just takes time and consistency for me to lose fear that I have (I assume that mixed with me forcing myself to bury the feelings). I really love him and want the rest of my life to be with him so please offer actual advice instead of just telling me to move on for good because I’m so young. (I am aware I COULD move on, the thing is I do not want to and if things keep going how they have been for now there is no NEED for me to as we both want to spend the rest of our lives together as of now.) \n",

      "Body text: TL;DR I 27F and 27M fiancé, relationship I struggling due to my insufficiency to prioritize him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well exactly as title says. We’ve been together for about 5 years, engaged for 6 months. We have 2 kids together a 4 year old and a 5 month old. Life since January has been hectic and fast. In January I returned too uni to continue in a BSN program. I’m in school 4 of 5 days a week. My parents provide child care, but when they’re unavailable or last minute cancellations etc Finace takes over. Fiancé has been trying to get a business up and running since last August. That’s taken a back burner due to seasons changing ( lawn care company) and me going to school and needing support from him with the kids. He has been very supportive where he can, but I also feel like he’s jealous and secretly hating? He will make comments about how all I care about is school, I’m selfish with my time, I don’t think about him or his needs at all etc. my schedule next semester is lightening up and will free him up ( completely off helping while I’m at school if all goes to plan). But I feel like our relationship is suffering. He often says I always say and never do. I’ll say I’m gonna go to the gym and then I don’t. I say I’m gonna clean the house when I get home and then I don’t. I will admit I do have an issue with saying and never doing. I say I want to do a lot of things and then never do them. He tells me I’m a liar because of this. I can tell he is getting fed up. I want to be more present and attentive to him and his needs, wants and desires but I don’t know what to do. I have a lot on my plate and I feel like I resent him to an extent. I’m constantly go go go from the minute I go wake up till I go to bed. I have school, I’m picking kids up, dropping them off, doing homework, cleaning the house up, putting kids to bed etc. like I said he helps with kids, when needed because there’s no other option. But he also sleeps whenever he wants even the middle of the day if he feels like it. He plays video games when he wants etc. but he will ask me to do something to help him and I’ll say ok no problem. Then immediately walk away and start doing something else. I literally will forget within 5 minutes that he asked me to do something for him. I understand this can be because I don’t prioritize him. My brain is on 100 all the time and I’m so overwhelmed with school and everyday life. I’m failing miserably at being a partner and being a partner that sticks to their word. How can I change the trajectory of our relationship? How can I start doing what I say and meaning what I say? How can I show him that I do care about his life too and his goals and dreams and wants. He’s less affectionate, less complimentary, less interested in us spending time together over the last month and I can tell he is building a big wall of resentment. Yes I’ve tried to sit down and talk to him but all the feedback I get is I’m being selfish, I’m not thinking about anything other than school etc he told me he doesn’t care about my school because he has real life to worry about. ( which was extremely hurtful, school is very important too me and will benefit our family forever, when I begin working)  and for context my parents pay all the bills for living while I’m in school so the only thing he is responsible for his is personal bills such as credit cards gas etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know what exactly I’m expecting as a response but some way for me to say something and stick to it and implement it and take action. And for a way to turn around the tune of our relationship currently. How can I show him I do care and I do want to be here and that he is just as important to me as anything else?\n",

      "Body text: I (F, 23) have been with my boyfriend (M, 25) for about three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we met, I was a very confident person and knew what I wanted. However, about two years ago, I started to sink, and my self-confidence became increasingly low. To this day, I don't really know why this is happening, as nothing serious had happened between him and me at that time. My thought is that from that point on, I realized that he could potentially be my life partner. I quickly developed abandonment anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always knew that he was friends with a lot of women, but since I was self-confident in the beginning, it didn't bother me. I brought it up to him and didn't meet with acceptance, but rather with \"I shouldn't worry.\" At that point, however, I became more and more of an overthinker because I constantly saw posts from other women on his social media, and I had questions in my head like: Am I good enough? Does he find me attractive? Will he leave me for someone else? The fear grew and grew, and then, six months later, I found myself with 24/7 stress and negative thoughts in my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that point on, things only got worse. We had to live long-distance for a while (me in Germany, him in Italy or the USA), which was also very difficult for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time, he texted many women (whom he was apparently friends with), made small talk, or tried to meet up with them. When I noticed this and asked him about it, he said he didn't want to tell me about it because they didn't actually meet up, and he didn't want to stress me out or make me feel bad about it. Then I thought to myself, if you think I have a problem with it, why are you even trying, and why aren't you being honest? (I should add that I never forbade him from meeting other women, regardless of my condition, but he should inform me about it and talk openly.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, the same thing happened, except that he had \"met\" someone new on Instagram and wanted to meet up for a bike ride (we both ride road bikes). That wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the flirting and how to hide it from your girlfriend with a \"plan.\" When I found out, my world fell apart, as at that point, in our long-distance relationship, I was already struggling with trust due to the previous scenarios. For me, it was emotional cheating because he lied straight to my face, flirted with another woman, and actively chose to hide it from me, especially since he knew what issues I was struggling with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was close to calling it quits (that was about 8 months ago). To this day, he can't give me a clear answer as to why he did it back then. He says he was afraid of \"missing out\" and that it made him realize he wanted nothing more than me. So I gave him a second chance, but my trust was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He flew to his family in the US for Christmas. It was a very difficult time for me, since most of his female friends are from there. As expected, he asked me if he could meet up with a long-time girlfriend (we've known each other for over 15 years, but we also had something in common). As I said, I didn't want to forbid him from doing it, but it was very difficult to stay calm. Sleepless nights and panic attacks were part of the daily routine during those two weeks. In between, I spoke to his sister on the phone, and she said she didn't understand why he absolutely had to meet up with this girlfriend when he knew what it was doing to me... I understand her point, but is that right? Because ultimately, I'm the person who has to work on myself and deal with it. And of course, I often wonder if I can ever trust him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time, however, I have to say that he has constantly kept me updated and responded to my messages and calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been living together again since January and are trying to build trust somehow. Whether it will work, I have no idea. So far, we've only had one other scenario where he liked pictures of women (some he knows and some he doesn't) in bikinis, which I made clear from the beginning that I simply didn't want to do, as I find it disrespectful. You can look at the pictures, but do you have to give the woman confirmation that you like what you see? Especially if that person is in a relationship? We plan to fly to the USA together in September. However, I have reached the point where I simply no longer know whether I am the problem with my problems or whether it simply no longer fits.\n",

      "TL;DR, Because of many scenarios I started to worry if this relationship is still good for the both of us + my problems aren't contributing to a healthy relationship, I am at a point where I don't really know what to do.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR: My girlfriend (32F) and I (31M) have been together for 5 months. She recently said she enjoys being alone at home with all the doors and windows open, wearing whatever she wants. I responded sweetly, saying: “Soon we’ll have our own place and you can feel free there too.” But she replied with: “Yes, everything has its time.

      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and at the start we would have sex very often, a normal amount we both felt good about. Since the beginning of the relationship we have both struggled with infidelity, first it was me who cheated on him with a stranger, then he cheated on me with my best friend at the time. A lot of messed up stuff. But we worked through it and this was 2 ish years ago and we are still together\n",
      "\n",
      "For probably about the last 2 years we have had sex MAYBE once every 2-3 months. I seem to be the one that's always wanting it, he gives me reasons why he doesn't, \"I'm tired, not in the mood, it won't be very good/long\".

      "\n",
      "About 8 months ago I caught him engaging with a sexual reddit community with other guys and girls frequently. He's not gay. Talking erotically with other guys and about porn etc. it made me uncomfortable and after a conversation about sexuality he assured me he's not gay and was just curious, and he promised to stop.

      "Body text: Me (22M) and my gf (24F) have been together for a few months now and things are going great for the most part! She's sweet thoughtful a great listener and incredibly silly, however, when we do things together that are more romantic like kissing or cuddling, put simply it's not what I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a more submissive guy, due to past trauma and that just being my natural preference, I particularly like the more assertive and softer women when it comes to more intimate things, I want to be grabbed pulled in and held, kissed, loved on, etc... but with my Gf this isn't the case. As I said she's sweet and a great listener which is very helpful for my traumas and I very much appreciate it, but she is also very much leaning towards the submissive side too, when we cuddle she's always the little spoon or getting held, rarely I get held and it's never been me being little spoon and more so me laying on her shoulder with one arm around me as we watch a movie. Every time we have a deep passionate kiss or make out I'm the one initiating it, when she kisses me it's a cute silly kiss on the cheek nose lips and other parts of my face and sometimes a more tender one but never even close to a passionate one or lasting more than a few seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want her to grab me either by my waist or shoulders or collar or even my head, pull me in and kiss me the way I kiss her, I want her to lock the kiss she initiated almost as if saying I'm not done with you and keep kissing me till I tell her I need to breathe or she's satisfied. I want her to lay down and pull me into her arms wrap her legs over me pulling my face into her shoulder as she plays with my hair. I want her to whisper loving things to me while she does so. When I'm tired I want her to sit down and gently pull me in to lay on her lap and just talk to me listen to my day and help me relax.\n",

      "There is only a couple times when I got this kind of attention that I wanted. It wasn't the best it was silent and still and wasn't as doting as I would've liked but I really loved it because I was being held by her, and it only happens once every month or so if I'm lucky and it's only when I tell her I want to open up about something deeply painful and emotionally scarring.\n",

      "We spend a lot of time together, every day we spend time together, while I admit sometimes it's just working together many nights it's movie nights and stuff so it's not like the opportunity for privacy and connection isn't there. But what always happens is I hold her, I cup hee cheek pull her in and kiss her, I gently hold her hands and guide them to places to be on me either my back my chest my head my shoulder and then they sit there as we kiss, I know she puts a lot of concentration into the kissing itself which is fine and I very much enjoy but besides that effort in the lips she puts, there is no effort elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's her first relationship my expectations on her knowing what to do are none. But we have had conversations about this, I've told her on multiple occasions that I very much like this kind of thing, and while she's picked up some small things like with the stuff she does with her lips. Those big things that I particularly want are nowhere to be found. I've told her that while I love kissing her it would mean the world to me if she kissed me. Same with grabbing and holding me. I've told her that I love the more assertive behaviors like that and that it's something I very much want to experience. But I'm not feeling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to sound ungrateful for what she does, she's amazing in her own right and has so many qualities that make her an amazing partner, my main fear is that she's not the right partner for what I want and am looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought crossed my mind where I wouldn't propose unless she did some of the things I listed, grabbing and kissing me till we pass out or she's satisfied preferably being quite long, taking and holding me every now and then and not just when I'm stressed and anxious and spooning me, etc... but is that reasonable? She's amazing in so many other ways I would lose so much to not be with her, and I'm scared I'll never find a woman who would be the more assertive one within our relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want her to do this stuff all the time, I know from very bad experiences that being the more carring one in a relationship is exhausting and isolating and painful. But having only a slight chance to have that kind of love once a month and it's just for an hour or so one night? That's not enough for me. She's new to relationships and I get that and I'm doing my best to be patient, but when we've had multiple conversations about how this is the type of interaction I want and why it's important to me and not getting it is frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm gonna keep trying and see where it takes us, maybe she will pick up on it and start initiating those deeper moments more often but if it doesn't happen I might end things with her, is this a reasonable reaction? Are we not compatible? And is this something that is important enough to throw away the rest of the amazing things? Idk what to do it scares me because if this is an indication of what sex with her would be like then idk if I would be satisfied and fully fulfilled in a marriage with her.\n",

      "Body text: I just started dating this girl and she's amazing. Its my first relationship ever and its going great. Around 2-2.5 years ago I had feelings for my best friend and I had asked her out, she didn't feel the same and we didnt really have a great connection like I have with my girlfriend now. I moved on and I have no feelings for her whatsoever. I still hangout with the same group of friends and the girl I asked out is there and my gf will meet them too. I dont want to hide anything from my girlfriend and I feel like I should tell her, I want to be honest with her but I'm not sure how she'll take this. Do I need to bring this up?\n",

      "Body text: I (17M) have been with my girlfriend (16F) for about 9 months. In the beginning, things were amazing — we were open, shared values like loyalty, and truly felt like we understood each other. She had told me about her past mental health struggles and history of self-harm, but said she was doing better. I believed her, and I trusted her.\n",

      "Body text: My bf and I have been together for almost two years and I’ve always wanted to go away with him, even if it was only for a weekend in a close by city.

We have had our ups and downs, but we have always been good about communicating with each other. we don’t yell when we fight, and we have always been by each others sides. We are each others first everything, and he’s going into the marines in june. I currently live an hour away from him, so we are on the phone most of the time. This weekend, he went out with his friends to a beach camping trip before him and his best friend leave for basic, i had full trust in him up in till last night. i’ve never had anything to worry about, he’s never lied to me about anything. One of his friends, F17 texted me with screenshots of a conversation between the two of them when he was drunk. apparently him and his friends were playing hot takes and who they would date if they were single. He sent her a message saying she was “bad” and that if he was single, he’d date her. As soon as i saw the messages I call him and asked if he had anything to tell me. He immediately confessed and apologized. I told him to grow a pair and start acting like a man. Now, i’m stuck between ending things with him and staying together. It was our intention to stay together when he leaves, but i don’t know how i could rebuild the trust it takes to stay in a relationship. I’m not sure what to do from here.\n",

      "* I've been in a relationship for 2 years with someone who is married\n",

      "\n",
      "I (M, 48) am in a 2 year relationship with someone (F, early 50's) who is married but separated. We started dating while they were living together but sleeping in separate beds, as things got more serious or frequent between us, she told him she wanted to separate from him and he moved out. We have continued the relationship and I eventually started therapy to deal with my feelings around her still being married (I come from a divorced family and my mother has been married multiple times, so I do have some issues). Things were going great, there were a couple of issues that arose that were hard for me to deal with, usually involving finances, owning a house together, etc..but I was able to talk through them and realize why I react the way I do surrounding those issues. I know she loves me, so it is not a romantic jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now, we had just gotten back from a wonderful 2 month roadtrip while between jobs and a few weeks after our return she learned that her husband has cancer. He is someone who doesn't have close friends who could help and no family to help, so she stepped in. She was there at the hospital for the surgery, he recovered at her place for a week or two. He is now back at his own apartment but he will soon start radiation and chemo treatment and the outcomes are unknown, but I imagine he will need help during the treatment, but I have not dealt with chemo or radiation so I have no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am having a hard time with this. I have never said \"I love you\" to her because it has been hard for me to let myself go there while she remains married, which I have talked to her about more than once. I feel like this is my hangup and my problem because I know she isn't interested in him romantically, but considers him a part of the family. I really want to move on from the marriage hangup I have, but I am scared I will continually put up my guard romantically and psychologically. I know it seems like a red flag, but life is complicated and dealing with financial issues is hard and not fun, so I understand why they haven't legally divorced. She has told me that she hasn't done more in the direction of a divorce because I am not affectionate enough, which is true and related to my inability to say \"I love you\". But telling me that feels unfair as I think she should be dealing more with the divorce regardless of being in a relationship with me or anyone, but I also understand that maybe she needs to feel more secure before taking those hard steps. I did finally tell her the other night that I did love her. It almost feels like she comes with him, and I have to accept that. I am mature enough to accept someone being in a friendship with their ex's, at least I thought I was. Am I being stubborn? It feels like I am just shut out of that part of her life. Which I could live with if they were completely split off from each other, but they aren't. I don't know what to do. I know a part of myself has not allowed myself to love her fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in my late 40's now, I have never worked on a relationship as hard as I have this one. I feel like if I break up with her, I am just giving up on us and all relationships are hard in time and it will be painful, especially at a time like this, when she is dealing with caring for someone with cancer. I think his treatment will last around 6 weeks, she doesn't plan on going to all his treatments, I don't know what the plan is there, I don't think she does either, it's kind of a day by day thing. Should I suggest pausing things until the treatment is done and see what where things stand afterwards? I just really don't know what to do or how I feel, but I know I feel sad right now. I don't know if asking this on reddit is the best thing, but I am feeling so unsure about how to deal with this. Thanks.\n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (M19) and I (F18) has been together for 1 year. Throughout our relationship he has a hard time with change. He lacks awareness and needs alot of guidance. I'm his first girlfriend and I understand and accept that he isn't perfect. \n",

      "What frustrates me the most is his passiveness and inconsitency. He's done things I was uncomfortable with, which he wasn't aware that it was wrong (even though we've talked about it), he forgets alot of his promises, prioritizes others just because he can't say no, and just doesn't change. i try my best to create a safe and healthy environment because I thought I was the problem, but it now feels like I'm all alone on this relationship. He knows about all my frustrations and have promised me things but it just keeps going back to before. It's not even general things, it's specific things. I told him I felt shut down when he gets defensive, to which he said he'll hear me out first. For a few, he'll succeed... Then back to that again. \n",

      "It hurts so much because even when we weren't together, I would be the one chasing him. I've always loved him more. I've accepted who he is, threw away all my values and beliefs, just for him. I was happy to know I had someone by my side who supports, loves, and cares for me. But I feel so alone.. like I'm carrying the whole weight of our relationship, one tumble and it all crashes down. He doesn't really comment about whether i've hurt him (which i initiated on finding out whats wrong with me for him) and I thought he's just a stable and strong person, but now I think... What if he just doesn't care? It hurts so much for me but it doesn't for him. \n",

      "Title: I (24M) rekindled things with my ex (24F), but communication is stressful\n",
      "Body text: About three months ago, I rekindled things with my ex. We dated for two months previously. It ended because of my anxious attachment and me being overly clingy, and her being more avoidant and needing 24-48 hours of space away from all forms of communication to recharge after dates. Although she was the one to break up with me, two weeks after she had already reached back out to rekindle. We slowly started seeing each other again. What began as a “maybe we can stay friends with benefits” quickly turned into something that feels much deeper and more like a true relationship again.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The good stuff:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* When we're in person, it's amazing. She's emotionally warm, affectionate, present, cuddly — everything I could ask for. She acknowledges that the relationship is much more of a 'situationship' than FWB, acknowledges that our intimate time together are 'dates', recently parroted an 'I love you' during an intimate moment, and uses pet names like “babe” more freely now.\n",
      "* We’ve started going to a weekly sewing class together, which has become a consistent touchpoint in our week. We don't always get private time with each other every week due to her energy levels or hectic schedule, but right now it's been a great segway into hangouts which typically lead to intimate full days at her place.\n",
      "* She doesn’t have notifications on for Discord or text, but she’s been more mindful lately. She’ll sometimes leave heart reactions on messages or send a funny meme, drawing, or a pic of her cats, which is new for her and shows she’s listening to what I’ve told her I value, even if it's not nearly at the consistency I'd prefer (at least once per day).\n",
      "* She invited me to come home with her on the bus recently — a small gesture, but meaningful, especially after our last hangout ended a bit weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The hard part:**  \n",
      "Mel doesn’t really like texting, and we never call each other due to her working a receptionist job (it makes her feel like she's still at work). She's incredibly present with whoever she’s around IRL, but over messages she can disappear for a day or two, even when I’ve sent heartfelt things or casual check-ins. She said this is just how she is with everyone, and it’s not personal. But because I have an anxious attachment style and work from home with a small social circle, these stretches of silence hit me hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve talked lightly about this. I let her know that little check-ins, heart reacts, or “thinking of you” texts mean a lot to me — and she’s tried in her own way to meet me there. But she still drifts into days-long silences, even when things between us seem amazing. After our last sleepover, which ended awkwardly, she acknowledged my apology message with a heart react, didn't discuss it further, and then pivoted away from the whole subject, merely 'hearting' my apology message and moving on as if it never happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mel shuts down and retreats during conflict, choosing to self sooth on her own. Meanwhile I attempt to fix and patch up every minor issue we have and go mad overanalyzing things when there's no chance for me to talk to her about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Where I’m struggling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* I often feel like I’m walking a tightrope between giving space and needing reassurance.\n",
      "* I don’t want to overwhelm her or bring up emotional needs too often for fear of scaring her off — especially since she once left because I overwhelmed her before.\n",
      "* I don’t want to resent the fact that I’m doing so much emotional labor in trying to be perfectly patient, available, supportive, yet distant.\n",
      "* I haven’t messaged her in two days now after sending a good morning text that got no reply or reaction. I want to hear from her, but don’t want to pressure her.\n",
      "* I want to eventually ask her to become my girlfriend again, but can't deny that these issues need to be solved first before we take that leap again with each other. I'm sure she feels the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "**My questions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Is what I’m asking for (a little daily connection through messages, even just a check-in or heart reaction) actually too much in this unique situation? I don't want a general 'if she wanted to she would' response. This is a layered situation that I'm sure has a better answer.\n",
      "2. Should I bring this up again when we next have a private moment, or let actions speak louder than words?\n",
      "3. Is this relationship dynamic normal for people who are wired differently (like avoidant vs anxious), or am I setting myself up for heartbreak by waiting?\n",
      "4. Is it okay that I want intimacy to feel consistent — or should I learn to live with these gaps between closeness?\n",
      "5. How do people who don’t like texting maintain connection in relationships, especially when hangouts aren’t weekly?\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:**  \n",
      "I (24M) rekindled with my ex (24F) about 3 months ago. We’re extremely close in person — affectionate, emotionally present, and even saying “I love you” again — but she struggles with consistent communication over text, often going 1–3 days without replying. I have an anxious attachment style and value small daily check-ins, which I’ve lightly communicated. She’s made small efforts, but I’m still struggling with the silence and unsure if this dynamic is sustainable or fair. Looking for feedback on how to manage this or if I should accept this as our rhythm.\n",

      "Body text: TL;DR it’s been 2 months since we broke up, I fought for the relationship off of emotional impulses with expectations of us getting back together, having gone through a hefty low point I’ve reached out and we have been chatting as just friends. Despite this there’s a nag inside of me that’s been growing to say my final piece with my newfound clarity to release that last bit that doesn’t seem to fade, should I or should I not ?\n",
      "\n",
      "So to start, we broke up a little over 2 months ago, I fought for the relationship off of emotional impulses and long messages which I (mildly) regret. I don’t regret fighting for it but the way I chose to fight, albeit the past is the past. I’ve reached out about 2 weeks ago asking if she was comfortable being friends to which she replied I’m totally comfortable with that. Based on a dumb question I asked during a talk we had and her supposed “openness” to being friends this quiet yet strong expectation we might get back together has been growing inside me again. The dumb question I asked was if there was a future for us, her response “if it happens it happens but I’m just not thinking about that right now.” I’ve tried to shut it out and shut it down but it doesn’t seem to work… my guess is because I’ve changed a lot of things in my life, I was only working part time no big plans for school or even ideas… Yet now I’m working full time and accepted into uni, and part of me thinks that because I’ve “fixed” part of her “said problems” with why she was leaving me we could try again. I’m unsure on how to shut this little flicker down properly honestly. I’m not sure if maybe it’ll fade on its own but it’s only seem to of grown. It’s making me have erratic most likely emotional impulses that are becoming more frequent, perhaps it’s because I’ve without realizing reached out before the scar had time to fully settle. While yes I do still love what we had and care for what we had it feels abundantly clear she doesn’t but then at the same time I’m unsure how one could so easily just ignore and I guess pretend a relationship that long at this young of an age didn’t happen. Perhaps she didn’t fall as hard as i did, a question I’ll likely never have an answer to, my big issue is that I do love who she is as a person and do have fear of losing her out of my life entirely but the love I do still have for her has been growing, so to get to what I’m looking for advice on… \n",
      "\n",
      "Should I say my piece knowing my expectations are honestly, that she shuts down any communication between us, even as friends due to this little flicker of hope growing ? Or should I try and work through this on my own and see if it’ll naturally die down or perhaps grow ? \n",

      "Body text: TLDR: my husband always texts other women \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband(32) and I (29)have been married for 5 years, and this has always been a part of our relationship — even when we were dating. He loves texting girls. I don’t mean random women or strangers — just female friends — but there’s always someone he’s texting regularly. And they’re always single. He never does this with anyone that’s married. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t have an issue with him having female friends. I know the girls he talks to, and I even hang out with them sometimes. They’ve never acted flirtatiously toward him — they’re friendly and respectful. He says they “feel like the guys” to him. But I still find some of it… off.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, he works out a lot and has sent progress pics to one of these friends (a girl), saying it’s the same as if he were sending them to a guy. I also saw that she sent him an outfit pic — not suggestive, but a mirror selfie. That’s not something I do with my friends (male or female), and it just feels kind of intimate to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, we were out together one night and he wasn’t on his phone much. Later, I saw a message from her that said something like, “I haven’t heard from you, hope you’re okay, goodnight.” It kind of stopped me in my tracks. I never text anyone enough to have a “goodnight” text routine — and it made me realize they must talk a lot.\n",

      "Not that this necessarily matters, but I think she’s a lesbian, so I don’t feel romantically threatened. But still… is this weird? Is it weird that my husband seems to need constant close contact with other women — even though he knows it makes me uncomfortable — and is it weird that I feel so conflicted about it?\n",

      "Title: me (21) and my bf (21) are in a happy relationship but he’s very financially unstable, not very smart, and he isn’t passionate. I don’t know if it’s time to let go.\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR : my boyfriend (21) and I (21) have a very healthy relationship. He protects my heart more than anything, and he gives me what he can but he is so bad with his money. he’s not the brightest and he lacks some common sense. He was the only child, but like most people, we’ve had to teach ourselves things. he isn’t passionate about anything, and we basically only have small talk . In a way, I feel like his mother and he seems to kinda get upset when we have conversations because of how much I have to correct him or I have to basically teach him everything. I love him, and he loves me even more, but I want a partner who I can depend on and I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be long, and I’m still gonna try to sum it up, but someone please. If you could take the time to read I would appreciate it because I genuinely need help and don’t know what to do. How do you even bring a conversation like this up to a partner without completely crushing their soul? My boyfriend and I are both 21 years old. He is an amazing partner emotionally. We got into a relationship quick after meeting each other, it just felt right. He was so emotionally open that I think it made us fall in love very quickly. he is very gentle with me. He’s never raised his voice. He doesn’t argue, and he always puts me first when it comes to his plans or prioritizing quality time together. he isn’t controlling, and just overall We have a very healthy relationship. We have been together for almost 11 months, and from the beginning, we have always talked about our future together like marriage, kids, and, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I met him, he has always been on and off of jobs. Probably every 2 to 3 months he has to get a new job and he’s never been financially stable for more than 3 weeks. He grew up only child with a single mother. So no one around him has really taught him anything about money. Without being said i’ve dealt with financially unstable partners before, and it’s something that irritates me deep in my core, because it’s one thing to go through that for a little bit, but since I’ve known him, this has been the case, and there’s so many times, I have had to almost worry for him, because I feel like he doesn’t have anything in the bank. He doesn’t talk about his financials with me, and he’s been using money apps, so I’m sure he has a lot of built-up debt. he has to unlock his card Every time he goes and makes a purchase because he’s scared he will get a charge on his card. Except clearly If you have a charge on your card, Then it’s probably a bill that you have to pay . he owes money at the Gym because he never paid his membership and says that he will never pay it. He can’t download apps, because he hasn’t paid his Apple Music and etc. This is just to name a few examples of how terrible his money habits are .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " I grew up with my mother working, and also splitting bills with my father, who didn’t even pick up his dish after he finished dinner, so I’ve made it very clear that if I am expected to do all the house, chores like cooking and cleaning every single day then I will not be splitting bills especially when it comes time to have children . Most of the time I pay for my own food and I can count on my hands. How many dates we’ve been on and there’s only been one time. He planned one date by himself, and that was only after I told him to do that :/ he says he’s gonna do all these things, but they are always just empty words that never come true. When he says he’s gonna do some thing, or get some thing for me. I always just smile and nod . I grew up the oldest child and my parents also didn’t teach me about money, but that is where I realized I had to teach myself everything, especially now where any information is so accessible. I hate that. He isn’t at the maturity level, where he realizes he needs to be financially literate, and do things for himself, like creating budgets, or saving money . He is very undependable, and I could never ask him for help if I needed it . \n",
      "\n",
      "I love learning about everything that I can. I feel like I have a bunch of just random little facts about most topics people could think of including music, art space nature, animals, psychology,  Just honestly everything and I feel like I’m a very intellectual person who loves to have deep conversations about all of those things. I feel like me, and him can’t ever have actual deep conversations, because he will say some dumb nonsense or just nothing at all. And I feel like it’s because we aren’t mentally at the same place. In general, he’s not a very smart person, and sometimes he can lack a common sense. I feel like sometimes when we have conversations he gets irritated because I’m correcting him on most things because he just doesn’t know much , he’s not an idiot by any means there is just so much that he doesn’t know, and for his age. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like most of the things tend to just be common knowledge. I just almost feel like I’m his mother, and he is my child. it truly gets exhausting, dealing with my own things, and then also me worrying about him and helping him create budgets. I wish he could figure things out by himself, and I also wish that we could connect on things that are important to one another. And no, you don’t have to be a genius for me to feel a connection with you, but I feel like he isn’t passionate about anything. I feel like that’s what it makes me emotionally unfilled and now I almost resent him for it. And I feel like I’m acting not like myself around him, and just more bland and dry. I grew up and only child, I don’t wanna teach a man life skills when no one taught me. And I definitely don’t wanna teach a man how to take care of a woman financially enough or at least be financially stable to were she feels stability in her life, and like she could be a future with this person. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know he’s struggling and a lot of the job situations really aren’t his fault. But why is it that I always have to deal with men like this. I’m trying to figure out my own life , and it gets so draining when you can’t ever relax, and you can’t have your partner just take over for you and you’ll be comfortable enough with him to where you know you don’t have to do things yourself. Instead of being more feminine when I’m with him, I feel more masculine, like I have to take the role of leader, and tell him what to do. that’s definitely not the life that I wanna live.\n",
      "\n",
      "and I know he didn’t have any handouts but I just feel drained. And I know Love isn’t always enough to keep a relationship. I don’t know if these are things that could be resolved or if I’m being too hard on him, but I know what I want. And I know I’m not asking for too much. I think it might be time to let go, but I couldn’t see myself without this person. maybe we’re just still young and I know that we don’t have things figured out, but it’s just sad because even emotionally I’m craving something deeper, and a more passionate love but I truly do love him, and he is genuinely SUCH a good and patient man. We’re best friends, and we spend more time together than not. I just wish he was smart enough to help himself as well as being intelectual or maybe even smart enough to be passionate and feel deep emotions about things. how could you possibly bring this up to a partner who loves you even more than you love them without completely crushing them when they are nothing but so so caring and loving to you? \n",

      "Title: My girlfriend doesn’t initiate sex (lesbian relationship)\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR; :My girlfriend won’t initiate sex even after I’ve had a conversation with her about it, she says she’s hyper sexual and loves sex, but unless I initiate it then..there ya go. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So ima start off by saying that a lot of these posts on here about the girlfriend not initiating sex is about a straight couple, usually a woman to a man. I don’t know if it’s because women have a lower testosterone level than men or what, but that’s usually how it goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation is a bit different, I’m a woman (22) and my gf (26) doesn’t initiate sex, we haven’t been together long that’s my main issue. We’ve been together for 3 months, known eachother for longer but only officially been together 3. My girlfriend has expressed to me she likes being dominant in bed but honestly most the time I don’t want to be the submissive one. Too many exes in the past have made me feel bad about wanting to be the submissive (most women in the lesbian world ARENT dominant) and so over the years I’ve kinda changed my role. I like being the top now. Only every blue moon do I like being dominated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now don’t get me wrong she ALSO loves being submissive ontop of being dominant, whenever we do have sex it’s very intimate, whenever I’m inside her with a strap or my fingers are inside or I’m eating her out or whatever I’m doing, she’s always touching my chest or kissing me or rubbing all over my body. It’s extremely erotic on both our ends and she seems like she really enjoys it once I start. I don’t doubt she likes the sex pretty much is what I’m getting at. Even after she finishes and I ask her if she’s done she says no and wants me to keep going. We could go for a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I swear it’s seemed like if I don’t initiate things they never happen. I’ve been questioning if she’s into me, but I stop myself because she’s extremely closed off from everyone else. Like I mean she’s told me if she didn’t have to go to work, I’d be the only person she’d ever wanna spend all her days with. She constantly tries to go out of her way to do nice things for me, she compliments me quite a bit, and she always tells me she loves me. Maybe she’s just not sexually attracted to me? Maybe she’s too shy asking about it? \n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought up before that she never initiates sex, but I didn’t word it like that. I worded it like “why do you never show me you want sex? Like maybe a certain look or you bite your lip or you give me subtle hints that you want it?” And all she’s givin me is two answers; that she does feel like she shows it it’s just I don’t seem to see any hints (I swear she never hints at it I’m not just being dumb haha), or she says that she’s not used to being the one to initiate sex so it’s strange to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "A little background, she’s been with men and women in the last and the men specifically always initiated LOTS of sex is what she told me. She always was being asked and never had to be the one initiating things. But if that’s the case wouldn’t she try ti put in some effort to try to change that? It doesn’t take much to ask for sex or to give hints. If I’ve spoken to her about this before then why hasn’t there been any changes? And since our relationship is so fresh you’d think we’d still be having lots of sex 3 months in. When we first got together it was a lot of sex, almost every night. She expressed to me in the past she’s hypersexual and that she’s “like to have sex once or twice a day” I’m like :0 . I’m not the most sexual person in the world so that’s quite a bit for me BUT I mainly get off when someone gives me hints they want it. So now we could go a week or two and nothing, unless I initiate. I’m convinced if I stop completely we just won’t have sex. And I’m not the most sexual creature in the world like I’ve said so it wouldn’t bother me too much if we don’t have sex but I definitely feel more connected with her on a deeper level when we do get intimate. She’s also explained to me she feels more connected when we have sex too. What should I do? \n",

Weve been dating for two years now in a sort of long distance relationship (its around 400 miles and we meet a lot), and even though she said on multiple occasions that she wants to have sex and shes sending me lots of nudes when were apart, once were together her attitude is very different.

      "\n",
      "I'm a 28-year-old guy, and my wife is 22. We've been together for a while, and I can confidently say she truly, deeply loves me. She's incredibly affectionate—always hugging me, kissing me, cuddling me, and telling me how much she adores me. It's sweet and honestly flattering.

      "\n",
      "But recently, it’s been... a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s started expressing her love in ways that are more intense and kind of confusing for me. She’ll kiss me all over, squeeze me tightly, and then say things like, “You’re so cute, I could just eat you alive!” or “I love you so much, I want to devour you.” At first, I thought it was just playful exaggeration, but she’s been saying it more often, and with a level of seriousness that makes me wonder how I should respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, she doesn’t want to harm me or anything like that—she’s always gentle, and it’s not coming from a dark or scary place. She just seems so overwhelmed by her feelings that she doesn’t know how else to express them. She’ll joke about “biting my soul” or “absorbing my energy” because she wants to feel as close to me as humanly possible. Sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it’s intense, and sometimes I honestly don’t know how to react.\n",

      "I love her deeply, and I know this is her way of expressing her emotions. But lately, I’ve been struggling with how to receive this level of affection.

I would understand if I was a “bad” boyfriend, but I do everything in my power to make sure she’s happy even if that means suppressing my feelings. I put her before myself. Idk I just love her but I don’t know what to do about that aspect of our lives.

      "Body text: I've been in my first relationship for a year now — and it's a long-distance one. At first, things felt exciting and hopeful. But over time, as I became more focused on my career, I realized how much pressure I was under trying to balance both love and ambition.\n",

I hoped we could stay in touch through short daily chats about our day, but she wants deeper conversations and emotional connection every day.

      "Title: My (20F) boyfriend (20M) associates places with things that happened there and this hinders our relationship\n",
      "Body text: Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year and a half and we have this issue that each time we talk about it we are almost breaking up. He associates places, he has gone with me, with bad things that happened there. It is hard to explain so I will give an example. In the beginning of our relationship we were walking in his hometown in a park that he really loved. And we were talking about our past relationships so he asked me how many boys I have slept with. So i answered honestly - 4 (including him), two boys that we were in a relationship and one one-night stand. For context I was his first time. So he got weird about it and I felt it like he was judging me for this but this is not the subject here. For a long time he said that he could not go there because he was constantly associating this place with the thing he found out. Every place that we go - he associates with something - if I have cried there or if I have said anything that would disturb him, etc. He also said that he is scared to take me places because he does not want to ruin them in his mind. And this hurts to hear. so bad. Anyways I want to be together and he wants too but can’t fix this thing on his own. He denies therapy, I tried talking to him about it but he says that it may deepen the problem and he definitely doesn’t want that. So idk what to do. I know it is not my problem, but i want to try and help him fix it together so that we can have a healthier relationship, which now is on the edge of a break up. Help please 🥲\n",

After spending the entire night talking and laughing we went back to mine and put a film on. One thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together, it was the best night of my life and honestly I felt so comfortable with him. After that he cuddled up to me and I fell asleep. Sometime in the early hours he got up and left but did text me so when I’d wake up I’d see it haha. Think he knew I’d be a little hungover.\n",

Then in December 2023 she broke up with him and we started hanging out much more. Then in the new years she asked me out. Anyway, going back to the topic, i shyly asked her if she was fine with deleting the photos she had with him as it was all over her camera roll, she said Ofcourse and that she was wanting to do it for a long time. A couple days passed and she said that she went through all her apps and deleted everything. For the next couple months, everything was pretty smooth sailing, though this lingering feeling of not being enough was creeping up as I noticed she didn’t put as much effort into our dates I planned or wasn’t as affectionate to me as she was to him. Then cut to October, I was at her house and we were messing about and one thing lead to another and I found that she still had nudes that she took with him (she claimed adamantly that she didn’t ever take those kinds of photos with him) and all the photos she claimed to have deleted were still there, as well there were photos of him hidden in the summer of him in the Snapchat my eyes only feature. From then on I have felt like a wreck, my mind and heart has been killing me. Lots of the bad stuff she claimed about the relationship were proven lies and yeah. And I have been getting harassed and stalked by said Ex, and he knew of the photos still being there which I suspect she is still talking to him yet claiming on having blocked him. I don’t know man, I just feel second best here. In her eyes you can tell. I do apologise again for the messiness of all of this, I just wanted to get everything off my head in a blurted format.\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend (26F) and I (29M) have known each other for four years, and we were best friends before we started dating about a year and a half ago. We moved in together six months into the relationship, and for a while, things were really good. We took trips, shared life as a team, and even when we argued, we worked through it and came out stronger. I truly believed we were building something lasting.\n",

But since the beginning of this year, our relationship has started to deteriorate.\n",

      "It feels like no matter what I do, I’m always falling short. I’ll forget something small, and what used to be mild annoyance turns into full frustration or even anger. I’ve made a real effort to avoid repeating mistakes, but there’s always something new to be called out on. And it’s not just the criticism — it’s *how* she expresses it. It often feels insulting, dismissive, and disrespectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I try to stand up for myself or express how I feel, I get brushed off or ignored. She’ll shut down when I make a fair point in an argument or change the subject entirely. It’s like nothing I say *lands*. And I’ve realized lately that some of her behavior mirrors the exact things she’s said she resents about her mother — being emotionally dismissive, unsupportive, and deflective.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a lot of hypocrisy. She expects things to be done perfectly for her, but puts very little energy into doing things for me. She wants instant responses when she talks but often ignores me when I speak. She demands respect but doesn’t offer it in return. These moments make me feel completely unimportant.\n",

      "I love her deeply. That hasn’t changed. But lately, I find myself wondering whether *she* still loves me — or whether I’ve become someone she no longer wants to care for. And then I feel selfish for even thinking that. She’s struggling. She’s dealing with so much. But I’m hurting too.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend(M20) and best friend (M16) dont seem to like eachother and I am not sure on what to do?\n",
      "Body text: I (F 19) met my boyfriend (M 20) on Tinder. I am a bit embarrassed to tell people that, but we had hit it off really well and have been together for a couple of months now. But the only problem we have had is trust because of his ex, and that has come with the conflict of him kinda not trusting me with other guys, which includes my best friend of 5 years. My best friend and I are online friends, but we were both really close to each other to the point where he called me sister, and I called him my little brother. We also like to tell each other that we love each other platonicly (Side note: I tell all my friends I love them and don't want anyone to think he has feelings for me because he is acesexual and likes men.). But recently my boyfriend opened up to me how he doesn't feel comfortable with me matching pfp with my friend because he had always seen is as a couples thing, and after a while of me explaining I have done it with my friends and the reason I dont like the thought of unmatching with my friend is becasue I saw it as a virtual bff bracelet that we have because there isn't much we can do as online besties. But we came to a compromise on me asking if my friend would mind matching pfp with me and my boyfriend. He said sure he didn't mind and for a bit we did match pfp, but after a bit when  My bf and I had an argument (we later resolved) I had ranted to my friend about it and ever since then he has told me he didnt l ike the red flag he was seeing from my bf. After that day, he said he didn't want to match pfp with my boyfriend and me for a couple of reasons. 1, being he felt the push coming from sharing the pfp with my bf and I and 2, being he has had a past experance where he was friends with this guy for a while and then when he got a girlfriend, she always seemed to be verly jealous of there friendship and alwyse butted in between them until one day he just stoped talking to my friend. So after that conversation with my friend, I was sad but told him it was okay and no hard feelings. after a week of me keeping this info to myself because my boyfriend was going through some stressful events and I had essays I needed to work on I then told him what my friend said, and he seemed upset (which is understandable) and was talking about how he jus wanted to feel included and didnt want mean to give off a bad vibe to my friend and wanted to talk to him, I told him I would ask my friend my I'm not sure if he will aggre because he dosent realy talk to people much and a little bit of information i didnt tell my bf is that my friend dosent realy like him right now. But my bf is telling me to ask him to let them talk about it and change his mind, while I told him I will ask there isn't a 100% guarantee he will want to talk to him 1 on 1, and I am kinda telling him its fine my friend isnt mad at him and he is upset I dont seem to care and I made him feel like I dont care about his feelings.\n",

      "this is my first post in a long while so please let me know what I should do in the situation because I don't want to lose either of them but at the same time, I'm not trying to be a pushover, and if you need more context or have question,s please let me know!! (Another side note, this is my second ever relationship. I have only ever had one other, but that only lasted a week and was in my 2nd year in high school lol)\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: My boyfriend feels insecure about the closeness I have with my friend, particularly when I used to match profile pictures with him, which my boyfriend sees as something romantic. To compromise, my friend agreed to match PFPs with both me and my boyfriend, but later backed out due to discomfort with past negative experiences with jealous partners. I delayed telling my boyfriend because of other stressors, but when I did, he got upset and wanted to talk to my friend to clear the air. While I was trying to manage both sides, but feel caught in the middle, and now my boyfriend feels hurt and thinks I am dismissing his feelings and leaning more twords my friends side\n",

      "Title: I [18 M] asked a friend out [F18] and I think I made the wrong decision, how do I let her down gently?\n",
      "Body text: I, M18, asked one of my mates (F18) out like 1 month ago, while I was drunk at the bar for another friend's birthday. I hadn't liked my friend Anna (fake name) for that long, I wouldn't say I was pressured but more so just overly confident in myself/feelings. Usually I'm not so good with that stuff. Anyways we hung out at my house and I planned the rest of the date because I was going to keep my word. It ended up falling on a group holiday/vacation with 4 other friends, and it's about ten days long, the date was yesterday (day 5). But I realised while I was there that I'm not exactly as into her as I thought I was. Nothing at the date went wrong or anything, fairly regular for a first date, but I'm just not ready for a realtionship, or at the very least not one with her. My main issue is that I found out while getting ready to go to sleep yesterday that she has liked me for 8ish months. And just for clarification we're not offically dating or anything, but she seems way more invested than I am, because I just very casually liked her. I'm not sure how to go about letting her down, because A) I asked her out, B) she's liked me for wayy longer than I have (and she said she was happy that I'd finally asked her out) and C) we're obviously still on holiday together..? And I would like to avoid hurting her feelings gravely if possible, as I would still consider her one of my mates. Any advice would be hugely helpful and appreciated. Thanks.\n",

      "Title: My boyfriend (31M) compares me (29F) to other people (10 -year relationship)\n",
      "Body text: Hear me out. Before I go into detail of what the problem is I want to clarify that I’m looking for a solution, not advice telling me to break up. Other than this persisting problem in which we both equally wanna solve, he’s literally the best human being who makes me feel so loved and is the person I want to spend my life with. I plan to have him read the comments on this thread later and I don’t want him to feel hurt. As for myself, I’m the one writing this post hoping to get some real advice, so any criticism you have for me, I can take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, Me (29F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together for 10 years now. We’ve been through ups and downs together and any problems we have we can communicate to one another. But one persisting issue I have with him is he sometimes compares me to other people. It’s not just to other girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "One instance is when he was talking to me about one of his celebrity crushes, just typical fangirling behavior, which I don’t mind. But he suddenly makes this comment\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s witty, you’re not like that”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him right away that I was not ok with what he said. He told me I should chill, that he didn’t mean it as a comparison. We fought. Reconciled on a good note. He told me he’d be more careful with his words in the future. However, I know that deep down he thinks I’m too sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another similar situation occurred within the same month. We were talking about Thai music (for context, we’re both Thai) He was saying that I don’t know a lot of Thai songs which is true because I usually listen to other stuff. This was fine. He was just stating a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then another weird comment was made. He had been playing guitar to Thai songs with his colleagues for fun lately. He said he enjoyed it a lot because they know the lyrics to the songs and can sing along “You have a nice voice, babe, but you don’t really know the words” I felt like that was a direct jab at me so I snapped a little and told him that he doesn’t know the words to the songs I listen too as well so why should I know his music. I felt offended but thought that maybe I’m being too sensitive so I didn’t press it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third time he commented on my inability to sing every Thai song there is was when he went out with his colleagues to a bar that exclusively plays 90’s Thai music. He invited me to go with him but I ended up not going because I didn’t feel like going out that night. After he came home he told me he enjoyed that night a lot because he could sing along to every song with his colleagues. He then told me “It was a good idea for you to stay home, babe, there’s a lot of oldies. You probably wouldn’t be able to sing along”I was so annoyed but I kept quiet. Didn’t wanna start a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally the fourth comment on the same topic was made today and the reason why I decided to write this post. He was driving and we passed by a bar. He told me he had visited this bar once with his friends recently. I asked him how it was. He told me that it’s a good bar, played live, Thai music mostly, and proceeded to remind me again how I wouldn’t enjoy it as much because “You don’t listen to that many Thai songs”\n",
      "\n",
      "I snapped. Big time. Yelled at him. Told him how annoyed I was with his constant comments. He snapped back at me, told me that he had no idea what I was talking about “What comments, I only made one. You’re so sensitive. I have no idea what I can or can’t say anymore. There’s no limit for you”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had the biggest fight. I told him that he’s been making several comments about this but he denied and told me he had not, I had to tell him the specifics of each comment. He could only recall one of those past three comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that I’ve constantly been on his ass. That he never meant those comments as comparison. He was just stating facts and thought nothing of it. I told him I wish he’d be more careful with his words because what he said made me feel inferior, like he was pointing out flaws I didn’t know I had.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me he feels really suffocated. He really thought nothing of what he said, didn’t mean to hurt me or compare me to anyone. Told me that he loved me for who I am and wouldn’t want to change a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve known him for 10 years. I believe him when he says he thinks nothing when he makes those comments. He would never intentionally say things that he knows would hurt me. He values the peace in our relationship too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the problem is he has no idea what he can or can’t say anymore. He told me that since we had a fight over that celebrity crush comment he’s been so scared that he’s going to unintentionally hurt me again so he’s been real careful and that made him feel suffocated. He wants a straightforward solution so he can make sure this never happens again. But the problem is there’s none. This is such a case-by-case problem so I could only tell him to just be more careful with his words. He told me he HAS been but the same problem still happened so he doesn’t know what to do anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "For further context, during the first few years of our relationship, he had made some mocking comments about my body and compared me to other girls before. I was never that confident in my body to begin with but these negative comments from my boyfriend created the biggest insecurity in me. I had communication issues in the past so I never directly told him how I felt, until I exploded. We talked and he apologized, felt really sorry for what he did. Now he often tells me I’m beautiful and praises me every chance he gets. Partly because of that, I had gotten a lot better at dealing with my insecurity. I can honestly say that I’m confident and very happy with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But sometimes during my weak moments, I doubt his compliments. Thought to myself maybe he’s just saying this to make me feel better but didn’t actually think I’m beautiful because he used to make fun of my body. Our relationship is the best and so loving but it’s not without scars and some healing wounds. I wholeheartedly forgave him for what he did but I think I can never forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this argument we had, I’m thinking to myself that he probably made those comments frequently without realizing because those were aspects he felt I lacked and wished I was better at them. I told him I think that is the reason but he denied, saying that he never thought I should change. That he’s very happy with what he has.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I’m rambling at this point but for the past 10 years me and him have been through so much together. I wouldn’t have stayed as long as I had If I wasn’t happy with him. But this recurring problem has been eating at both of us and we feel exhausted emotionally and mentally. I don’t want to make him feel like he has to watch his every move when he’s with me but that seems to be the case currently. I realize that this is the issue that I have to work on myself If I want to continue this relationship. Both of us had been working on it, especially on his end. But it still happened again. He feels bad and suffocated, I feel hurt and insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is, for anyone who has had similar experiences, what do you guys see here? Do you think I’m being too insecure and sensitive? Is there any way to navigate through this properly? My boyfriend prefers a practical solution that will ensure this type of incident never happens again, if there’s one that works for you please give us advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR my boyfriend keeps comparing me to other people about seemingly random and trivial things.\n",

      "Body text: Dated for 1.5 years. While we have our differences, we've been a happy couple together when times were good. Unfortunately, like many others, times are not good right now. Both of us are hit with stressful situations outside of relationships, and we haven't been properly been able to support each other - particularly worse on my side, as I fold pretty hard on interpersonal stress and anxieties.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a tendency to go on a positive feedback loop when both of us are stressed out at the same time. The same thing almost brought us to the brink of breakup half year into the relationship, but we perservered and managed to work things out together. Now, we're in a similar situation (albeit with different sources of stress), and I've been working with my therapist and her to figure this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "My GF and I have been trying to make some respectful, heart-to-heart communications on our relationships throughout this week. While I do think these communications are invaluable, we (or at least I) are realizing that we are much different from each other:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. She trusts people from the beginning, believing in her judgement. I, on the other hand, gradually build trust over the time as we share more experience together. I always leave a benefit of doubt against my own judgement, especially when I don't have much data to back.\n",
      "2. As a result, she doesn't appreciate that it feels like she needs to prove herself to earn my trust and commitment, which is quite far outside of my comfort zone and cannot be provided.\n",
      "3. I felt that she has been committed and trusting me in the relationship, but she doesn't feel the same for the reason above.\n",
      "4. She leans towards naturally growing closer together when forming human relationships, and is stressed out that trying to work things out with her feels like, well, a work. While I also believe in the value of letting things flow naturally, I believe it eventually plateaus and you have little control over whether it'll work or not. In addition, I believe all (at least nearly all) romantic relationships will require constant work.\n",
      "5. She feels like our relationship has stagnated in the last several months, which I disagree. Both of us have a better understanding of each others' boundaries, can communicate more respectfully, and have more trust towards each other (or at least I do). \n",
      "\n",
      "For all the reasons above, she is worried that we might be incompatible to each other. She also currently seems to be overwhelmed with these thoughts and is unable to process them by herself. I believe two human beings from different upbringings will naturally have major differences, and that those differences doesn't necessarily mean incompatibility. I've emphasized this and that constructive & respectful communication can go a long way to close the gap. \n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the conversation, I felt confidence in what I believed in, but could acknowledge how she could feel that way given our differences. We've ended the discussion with an agreement to try out couples therapy. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the more I think about it, the less confident I get. What she have felt and the perspective she provided were very valid, even if it was wildly different from mine to the point I've never even considered it. What if she's right? What if there really are some things that are important to her that I won't be able to compromise on? I am willing to work through the problem to see if the situations improve, but what if I'm giving her a false hope and dragging her into more suffering? What if she doesn't have the energy work through the problem *with* me?\n",

      "Body text: My ex and I dated for two years, and he ended up breaking up with me but we still kept seeing each other. I found out that he had kissed his ex girlfriend while he was REALLY drunk at a party, and I found out from one of his friends. At first he was just angry that someone told him rather than letting him tell me himself. We had a long talk and he apologized profusely and understood that what he did was wrong and that there’s little to nothing I can do to move past this. But all I want is to forgive him and get back together. My friends that I met when we broke up are telling me that he’ll continue doing this and he has no sympathy for me and what he put me through but they’ve only met him a couple of times and I know he feels terrible for what he did to me. I just don’t know if this is the right decision and all I want to hear is that it will work out and we’ll be able to move past this.\n",

      "Title: Looking for advice on whether I (35F) should stay with my husband (35M) with large difference in ambition levels\n",
      "Body text: Looking for advice on whether to stay or leave husband with drastically different ambition levels  \n",
      "In a nutshell: Husband and I have been dating for 5 years, got married last year. Since the first year of our relationship, I have been bothered by what I perceive to be a lack of drive/ambition both in his job and our household. It is eating away at me and I can feel my frustration at his lack of productivity building.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explain further: I am a physician and consider myself quite ambitious and hard working. He is in real estate, but he does not put much effort into the job (he has had about 1 client per year over the past 5 years, all of whom were friends of his already; no one he met after he became a realtor as I know he does not put much effort into networking or marketing his business). He spends most of his time at home doing what I consider to be hobby activities-trading some stocks and purchasing collectibles (probably makes $30k a year from these). Overall he does not bring in much income - which I am ok with - but it is the lack of effort/industriousness that frustrates me when I come home from a long day at work. In line with this theme - he's not much of a go-getter when it comes to household tasks either; for instance, if the house is messy he will not take the initiative to clean it up himself. If the laundry is full, it'll stay full until I tell him to wash it, then it will sit in the dryer for days before he folds it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What has kept me in the relationship is 1) He generally listens and supports me when I ask/tell him to do something whether it be cooking/cleaning (but I do feel like I have to tell him to get it done) 2) with his flexible career lifestyle, I anticipated this would help a lot with childrearing since he could be a SAHD and I do genuinely feel he is interested in being a good supportive dad 3) he has a good-natured/peace-minded temperament - for instance, when we get into arguments, he 9/10 times the one to talk me down and try to work on our problems which I recognize is a rare and commendable trait in a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find he is at ease with his low-pressure easy life which I recognize has been causing me to feel a growing resentment every day, especially after long shifts like a 12+ hour day. When I address this issue, he states it was a long time for his career to grow and that he's \"working on himself\" for instance he'll listen to audio books on real estate - so I have always had hope that he would become more ambitious and his career would blossom with his hard work but my honest assessment is that I don't see any transformations in him. His lack of ambition sometimes even irritates me to the point where his affection annoys me.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: My husband is not ambitious.. he doesn't take much initiative in his career and household and it has increasingly been causing resentment within me. But he also has some nice qualities (peace-minded, supportive, and maybe the time will help with childrearing). Looking for insight from any 3rd party who has been with someone like this and how it turned out down the road...I guess I'm trying to see if someone's input may convince me to give him an \"out\" on his lack of ambition to put my mind at ease, or if I will just continue to feel this way day in and day out, in which case I don't know if I will every feel fully happy staying...\n",

      "The last few months have been hell. Wedding planning turned into a war zone: endless arguments over how many events, who gets invited, and which traditions to include. We tried to compromise-first one wedding for both cultures, then two, then back to one-but every solution just led to more resentment and fighting. I’m exhausted. It’s affecting my work, my health, and my mental state. I even looked into inpatient care because I felt so overwhelmed.\n",

      "Body text: Hi Reddit. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m in a relationship of about two and a half years with someone I really love. We are currently long distance. \n",
      "\n",
      "He recently opened up to me and told me that he doesn’t feel understood by me, and that he’s not sure if he ever will. That’s something he’s struggled with in most of his friendships too, but it’s especially painful for him in a relationship. It’s brought up a lot of anxiety for him about our future together.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that conversation broke my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s one of the most emotionally mature people I’ve ever met. His EQ is off the charts. He’s the person all his friends go to for help with relationship stuff, conflict, emotional support, anything. I’ve even sent my own friends to him when they needed advice. It’s like he has therapist-level emotional skills. He just gets people, and he can see the full picture in a way that I really admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him one time how he does that, like what makes it possible for him to communicate and understand people that deeply. He told me two things. First, you can’t be rigid in your own stance. If you’re not flexible, you’ll never be able to actually see someone else’s perspective in the first place. And second, you have to actively put yourself in the other person’s shoes. Not just acknowledge what they feel, but really step into it and understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s where I struggle. Because I don’t even get to that step. I’m stuck at step one. I never learned how to process my own feelings in the moment, let alone communicate them or hold space for someone else’s at the same time. When I was growing up, I didn’t have the space to express feelings. If I was angry or upset, I couldn’t say anything. I’d go to my room and journal alone, and that was the only time I felt safe to process anything. So now, in this relationship, when something intense comes up, my brain goes into survival mode. I freeze. I shut down. I step away because I’m overwhelmed and I’m terrified I’ll say the wrong thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one time during a conflict where I felt so emotionally overwhelmed, I kind of shut down and just backed out of the conversation emotionally. I didn’t even realize how that would feel to him. But he told me afterward that it felt like I abandoned him emotionally, and I completely understand that. It hurt to hear, but I get it. He’s someone who needs to feel like we’re in it together, solving things side by side. When things aren’t resolved, it lingers with him and ruins his day, and I honestly feel that way too. But our triggers trigger each other. He needs closeness and real-time communication. I get scared and need space to think. It just… clashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here’s the core of what’s been really hurting him — and what I’m scared I won’t be able to change fast enough. He’s said that when we’re in conflict or even just discussing something important, it often takes hours or multiple long conversations across different days for me to fully understand his perspective. He says he has to break down his feelings and thoughts over and over again, rephrasing, repeating, explaining in different ways. That’s emotionally exhausting for him. And more than that, it’s the reason he feels misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes him feel safe is being able to say how he feels once or maybe twice, and for me to just get it. Not perfectly, not with the perfect response, but to really get it without needing him to explain it ten different ways. That’s what understanding looks like to him. That’s what safety feels like for him. And I’m not there yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since that conversation about his anxiety and how unseen he’s felt, I’ve started freezing up even more. Not because I’m afraid of conflict, but because now I feel like there’s this pressure to “get it right,” and if I don’t, it’s going to be proof that I’m not what he needs. It’s like, if I don’t perform perfectly in those moments, I’ll lose him. And I don’t want to lose him. I want to be with him forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, I am trying. I’ve been practicing saying how I feel in the moment, even if it’s messy or half-formed. Sometimes I even say, “Hey, I’m trying to do that thing, to tell you how I feel right now instead of later,” and I go for it. He’s been patient when I do that. He’s given me space to make mistakes and grow. But I’m scared that if I mess up too many times, it’s going to be the last straw. And I would understand that too. He deserves to feel emotionally seen and safe with his partner. And I want to be that person for him. More than anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s not perfect either, and I’m being patient with his flaws too. But this one thing, this pattern, is something he’s brought up a few times now. He’s pointed to several conversations where he’s felt unseen or unheard, and it’s clear it’s becoming a big issue for him. And that terrifies me.\n",

Fast forward a few years, he started using some pills that you can get over the counter at smoke shops, etc. Then he started asking for scripts from his doctor for pain that was not communicated to me. Now it's both of these, plus alcohol (not extensively, but drinking beer). All of these things are hidden from everyone except for me. \n",

      "No 1) A couple of months back I was facing work related issues in my team and I briefly told him about it on the messages since i was at home. He said we'll talk tonight about this. In the night, we did talk but he didn't ask me this. Maybe he forgot, that's what I personally think because he is a forgetful person but it still hurts and gives me a feeling that he didn't care about it enough to make me talk about it again. I'm not a pushover person, like I can talk about a thing only if you're interested in it. I'll not shove it down your throat. If you don't want to hear it or if I get that feeling, I'll just let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that a couple of months later,  in person I happened to share few things with him which was kind of really tough to share and I was not planning to share any of it and one day we just happened to talk and I happened to share it. That was in person. (Though this wasn't exclusively about my personal problem s, It was about a common friend and some other related things). I was really proud of myself that day that I was able to talk to him like talk talk. That was also the first time, I happened to cry in front of him and it was liberating given that I can't cry infront of anyone. All this made me feel closer to him emotionally. For me feeling emotionally close in a relationship is super important. I want to feel that way. He did listen to me all throughout and I finally felt oh I can too share things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you he isn't a bad listener. He does listen but sometimes I feel like he does not like to talk enough. Even with my friends, we talk a lot, about anything and everything in the world.  So probably I'm expecting the same from my partner which might be too much I know\n",
      "\n",
      "No 2) Let me tell you about another instance where I felt he didn't care. So the flat we are living in, I had some argument with the owner related to some repairs that needed to be done in the flat that we recently moved in and the owner was not on board with it, so I had a long discussion with my owner. Since I share the flat with him, I really wanted to crib about it to my partner after the intense discussion. It was really late in the night and he said he wanted to sleep and that we'll talk about this tomorrow. He was sorry about it that he couldn't listen me crib in that moment. It did hurt me then but I was like okay. But what really hurt me more was that the very next day, even the next to next day, he didn't bother to ask me about it. And so I wasn't comfortable to share with him again and I didn't because I don't want to force him to listen to my cribbing. And I don't crib much, just that on a few occasions, I become a cry baby. The only reason I wanted to talk to him about it was because we both share the flat and if there is an issue, it's a shared issue. It's not my personal one. After he didn't ask about my work problems, I've stopped sharing my personal problems but I thought I'll still share the common problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably he cares but is forgetful or probably he really doesn't care. If the latter is the case, I really want to rethink about our relationship again. Because for me that's important for emotional intimacy. The lesser I share things with him, the lesser I'll feel for him. I want more of friendship in our relationship. I'm not in it only for the romantic gestures. And from my side, I really like him. And I really care about him. I want him to talk about his problems and I'm genuinely curious to know more about him and because of these couple of instances I don't feel if he's genuinely curious about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "No 3) On the similar lines, I had another heated conversation with owner. By heated I meant it was a formal conversation only but more like a detailed point to point conversation which took a lot of energy from me, after this incident I briefly told about it to my partner 4 days later because I had to tell him and it took me a lot to share with him since the last time he had declined to listen to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm thinking if I'm not comfortable talking to him about the common shared problems, it's super difficult for me to talk about my personal problems, which is entirely just about me. And that's what bothers me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still love him and want to be with him and work on these problems but only if he does care about me. I don't want to be pushover. I don't want to share my problems if he isn't interested in talking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think he might not be aware about how I've felt on these instances and that he deserves to know about how I felt. And that I'm constantly re thinking about our relationship.\n",

      "So I feel like it's not their fault. It's probably how they've been raised (Men, please correct me if I'm wrong)\n",

      "So before rethinking our relationship, I should make an effort to communicate to him and I know it's super difficult of a task for me. He deserves to know for all I know.

      "\n",
      "We have been dating for 5 months. From the start of our relationship, I had some habits around how often I would go home (\\~1 hour away) to see my family on the weekends that did not sit right with her. Some of it was valid, there was a stretch I was either traveling or gone home for various reasons 3 straight weekends, and it became a topic of our fights pretty often (I've heard \"you're never here, you're home every weekend\" countless times), but nothing like that amount of time apart has happened since, I usually go home once every 3 weeks or so, and see my family once a week in some way. I'm a very busy person and also very close to my family, much more than her, but I really didn't feel that I didn't have space for a relationship in my life, but her idea of how much time I should dedicate to her is a little different. Since then, there have been quite a few things that have piled up and added to her frustrations; stuff like saying another girl's name in my sleep (which I genuinely have no clue of how or why it happened, I am 100% loyal), absentmindedly searching a girl on IG whose boyfriend's tiktok I saw, being late to a couple of dates, going home after an argument when I had plans with my dad the next day, etc.\n",

      "I have not been perfect, and it truly feels like this relationship has had no breaks. I don't understand why or how I accidentally hurt her seemingly every week without meaning to, and it's come to the point where she has a lot of bitterness toward me and has said some very mean things to me that have hurt me a lot. A lot of name calling, mocking, and belittling which I felt I don't deserve despite having not been perfect in this relationship, and it comes out every time she gets upset. Some things just don't leave my head; she once told me to \"go run back home to mommy and daddy and suck mommy's tits\" during an argument on how often I go home, and it just hurts to hear stuff like that from someone you see a future with. Her argument is that I've driven her to that state of frustration, she was always loving until I got her to that state.\n",

      "I'm not sure how to fix the trust between us, and being in the thick of it I'm not even sure I can think trust myself anymore, it is so taxing mentally to be told over and over how I'm not enough and how I don't care about the relationship, when I genuinely do. From her perspective, I am the villain in this relationship and cannot do anything right, and I agree I've not been perfect but the things she has said to my face have been so hurtful too and the pressure of trying to be the perfect boyfriend she sees for herself is so much. I just want peace. How do I go forward from here and try and fix things within myself and with her?\n",

They broke up on not good terms and he’s mentioned to me he feels guilty on how things ended and some mistakes he made during their relationship. We started dating/seeing each other about 2-3 months after they broke up.

      "The first major fight was early on in our relationship when we were just “talking and casually dating”. She called him a few times in one weekend and he brushed it off so lightly saying he didn’t know why she was calling. Later on when I saw their messages he had told her a week or two prior he was open to catching up sometime. So not sure why he acted surprised she called. He didn’t tell her he was talking to someone new and his justification was he felt like it was mean to rub it in her face essentially.\n",

Later I saw the message he sent her and it basically said something along the lines of “hey I recently started seeing someone new and she doesn’t feel comfortable with me talking to you. So out of respect for her can you not call or text without any notice. Sorry” basically. We had been seeing each other for over 5 months at that point.\n",

I asked him to remove it by putting them in either a drop box or shared album. Just away so it doesn’t need to keep popping up when we are together. He said he will and handled it. It kept popping up and I asked him if he actually did it or not. He said it’s too much work because there are so many photos.\n",

I told him on one condition, when we move into our next lease together (his lease ended so he stayed with me for a few months until mine ended at the time) I don’t want it in our new home together. He can ship it to his parents house or put it in a storage locker. I don’t want to bring it into our new home together, and he agreed.\n",

When I brought this up to him he said he wanted me to see him throw it away and he had just honestly forgotten about it. Whatever, we talked it out and maybe misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the other day she texts him, and he told me right away and kinda shrugged it off as a random dumb text. He didn’t seem to care to respond to it or at least that was the impression I got. It’s been for days since then and it’s been kinda in the back of my mind wondering if he responded. I feel like since he keeps responding even though it’s short, she keeps reaching out. Tonight at dinner, he got a text notification and immediately grabbed his phone at an angle so I couldn’t see the screen then put his phone in his pocket. I just immediately got a gut feeling it was her. I asked him did you ever respond. He said yeah then said “oh she actually just texted me back” and tries to show me. He texted her responding to her message after four days from her original text and said “blah blah blah happy Mother’s Day. Hope you and daughters name are doing well”. Then got upset at me and walked away. We got into a screaming match and he said I am so insecure about her for no reason and it’s ridiculous basically. I shouldn’t worry and that he just feels bad for her because she’s unwell.\n",

      "I get it. She’s mentally ill but also like it’s not your problem anymore … she lives in a different state and has friends and family who care about her. You don’t need to be feeling bad and trying to talk her down. I just can’t shake that he’s okay with me feeling insecure (the “love of his life”) about it and upset that he seems to care more about her well being than how I feel about the situation. I’m not sure if I’m being too sensitive and should just deal with it because she’s mentally ill.\n",

We have had multiple convos about it every time she reaches out but seem to always get escalated and not resolved. I trust him and it’s not romantic. I know he feels bad for her and wants to be a good person but it’s a boundary for me.  Am I being too much and difficult for no reason.\n",

Lately I am have been going through perimenopause and I have chronic pain which has made me want to have sex a lot less. I have suffered from depression off and on and he called me a “black hole.” I can’t seem to shake it. Now he is making me meals and cleaning but I feel like I have internalized his comments to me. My mom and uncle moved 45 min from me and they are very dysfunctional. He helped me some with them so I feel like I need to consider that. I worry about handling my finances on my own without him as he does contribute (he works as a bartender, I work in an office). I just feel like he struggles with depression too but won’t address it while I keep trying to. Is calling me a “black hole” beyond the pale? I feel he isn’t motivated to do much beyond bartending too. Should we break up?\n",

I guess another big thing is I’m very scared of what will happen if we break up since we live together and I don’t have a job or anything else to fall back on.

It’s random, and she seems really happy when they talk. Once, she even suggested we meet him when he was visiting our city, but it didn’t happen. I try to be a modern, understanding husband and haven’t shown any issue with it, but deep down, I feel insecure. The guy is married, and my wife loves and cares for me a lot, but I can’t shake this feeling.To add, I don’t talk to any of my past female friends since marriage, and I know my wife would get upset if I did. She also checks my chats if I talk to any woman. I’m confused—am I overthinking this? How do I handle my insecurity without causing a fight? Any advice on how to talk to her about this?Thanks!\n",

We even watched movies together sometimes.\n",

There were times when we both felt sad or off when the other was gone, but we always came back to each other.\n",

He can't hold a normal conversation, constantly makes weird sounds, including fart type sounds (we are freshmen in high school...), is the loudest in the room, and is always repeating the same unfunny type of jokes over and over again. It feels like a burden to hang around him in class and in public because it, to be honest, feels like I'm hanging out with some several years younger than me.

      "Body text: So basically a group of friends and my \\[F19\\] boyfriend \\[M19\\] of 1 year were hanging out the other day and the topic of sex came up, which isn't totally abnormal.

I do not hold this against him to any degree, and quite honestly really am not bothered by it (it's way too much of a hassle to clean up anyway), but he was obviously shocked by the news. I can't know exactly what he's thinking, but I would assume he's probably just feeling super insecure right now and comparing himself, which I really don't want him to do but I understand and have definitely have done the same thing in the past as well.\n",

      "Body text: I (28M) have been dating a woman (25F) for about two months. We had a short fling last summer that ended suddenly, but we reconnected in February and started seeing each other again with more clarity this time. We're monogamous now, have regular communication and intimacy, and she contributes financially when we go out no issue there.\n",
      "\n",

      "A few weeks ago, while we were out, she made prolonged eye contact (about 5 seconds) with another man long enough that it felt deliberate. I didn’t bring it up in the moment, but the next day I calmly asked her about it. She said she didn’t remember it or maybe did it subconsciously. She apologized and acknowledged it could be seen as disrespectful, but insisted it wasn’t intentional. That left me unsettled.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also asked me recently what I think about exclusivity early in dating. I told her I feel that if you’re seeing someone seriously (daily contact, regular intimacy), you should respect that by not dating others. I asked if she was seeing anyone else. She hesitated, then eventually said she wouldn’t if she liked someone and no, she wasn’t seeing anyone. Her hesitation made me question things more.\n",

      "Last week, I suggested we spend Friday night together. She agreed but said she might have work early on Saturday.

The next day she didn’t text, and when I reached out, she responded coldly.\n",

      "We’re supposedly fine now, and she even suggested planning a weekend trip together soon. But I feel like something inside me has broken a little.

      "Today, we made some pizza for dinner. He served me a slice and I went to go serve myself another. He told me to stop and not do that. I just looked at him confused on why I couldn't. I continued to grab the slice and he continued to say no and to put it back. I started to give a confused smirk at this point because I couldn't tell if he was joking. He then said that he made the pizza (we both did) so he was the only one who could delegate slices, and give himself the best slices. I thought what he was saying was so ridiculous. He does typically try to give himself the best bits when we have food, but has never outrightly said it so blatantly, so this seemed out of character. So I laughed/chuckled at the absurdity of his statement. He then got angry and yelled at me for laughing. That I know he hates when I laugh at him because I think what he's saying is absurd or that he's crazy. I was shocked by his sudden anger. And got a bit angry myself. His reaction was not justified in my mind. I said I thought he was joking so I laughed. He said he was, but that I know he hates when I laugh like that and it made him upset. I said he made a joke and I laughed, why is he upset then? He said it's because in the past when I laughed, it's because I think what he's saying is absurd or crazy. He apologized though for yelling. We argued a bit. Both arguing our points. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't want to argue anymore and felt tired because it was going nowhere, like most of our arguments. So I then mumbled \"we shouldn't.. or I don't think we should.\" I didn't finish my sentence though. I didn't really have an ending to it. Not sure what I would have said if I did finish it. \"We shouldn't argue when hangry...we should stop talking...\" I don't know. Anyway, he then got up, sat away from me, and started watching a video. I didn't say anything in response for a few minutes, but then asked why he sat away. He said it's because I said 'I don't think we should be together'. I said \"No I didn't. I didn't finish my sentence.\" He said I did and that I know what I said. We argued on this for a few minutes. He said I'm trying to convince him he's wrong, while he's not trying to do that with me. But I know what I said or I guess didn't say. He kept saying I said something I didn't, which made me feel insane. I said he knows I didn't finish the sentence, but he likely filled it in with what he thought I was going to say. He said no and that I said it. I got upset that he doesn't belive me. He said he doesn't trust me. So I finally said \"fine, we'll agree to disagree on what was said.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do. These arguments are dumb. I know the start and basis for them is dumb. But we always turn dumb things into big arguments and they just hurt me. And I feel like I've built resentment over time. He's told me he doesn't trust me in the past. He seems to assume the worst of me sometimes. Like I'll say something. He'll assume a terrible meaning. I'll tell him I didn't mean it that way and meant it another. But he won't believe me. The lack of trust sucks but he believes it's warranted. Like when I ask why he doesn't believe me he's said a couple times that it's because I'm not a nice person or not as nice as I put off, so he can't tell. \n",
      "We've been together for 4 years and our arguments haven't gotten any better. We did couples therapy and still have the same issues. I try to use \"I feel\" statements when I remember and validate his feelings, but it doesn't change anything. The arguments still get bad. And I admit I didn't really validate his feelings here. I apologized for laughing during the pizza incident, but I struggled to validate during the other argument. I guess it felt like I would be validating a lie. Which I know is wrong of me. And I'm not perfect either, I realize. I obviously contribute to the arguments. But I'm just tired of them. I know arguments are normal in a relationship, but I don't think they always have to get unhealthy. He doesn't think they're as big of an issue as I do. This is my first relationship so maybe I am being over dramatic. I just wonder sometimes if maybe it doesn't have to be this hard. \n",

      "TL;DR My bf (30M) and I (27F) argue and it tends to become unhealthy in my opinion. We've been together for 4 years and it hasn't gotten much better. If anything, I feel like we've both become more bitter over time. This is my first relationship and I wonder if all relationships are just this hard. I know arguments are normal, but I feel so shitty. \n",

My boyfriend however is getting ready to be a senior in high school and has no motivation. He doesn’t have a job or a license and he isn’t putting enough effort into our relationship. He does however struggle with OCD and ADHD which might be the main cause for not having any of those things. I have told him I feel like this relationship isn’t going to work for much longer if he doesn’t want to put in the work to make it. I have done everything I can do. I pick him up and drop him off after dates, I pay my half and sometimes his, I come home from college to see him often, and I try to get him to come to my family events. My mom officially hates him and tells me I need to break up with him because I’m settling but he just applied for a job and he’s trying to change his behavior. So I’m stuck. I know we are both young but I don’t know what to do. I love him but I don’t want to raise him. Do I leave him when he is finally starting to grow up and try or do I stay and hope it changes?\n",

She lives just in front of my house, we never ever talked and I didn't even dared to talk because I was so shy until 3 years ago me and my mom went to buy some groceries and surprisingly she and her mom were also there and that's how we met, my mom introduced me to her and my mom told me to save her mom's number on my phone. One random day I saw her mom on snapchat but the username was showing different then I realised it was her younger sister's id through which I got her id and that's how the friendship started (ik it's complicated), then the friendship grew more and more we used to chat and call, we talked a lot about our pasts and she trusted me and thought I was a nice guy (she used to say it), she shared her traumas and past and had a serious trust issues and had lost all her friends with remaining just a few including me being very close. We used to talk everyday until 10 days ago we were playing a game who would have a great comeback and guess what... I said so personal things about her past( ik i was not in my senses what I was talking or saying to her knowing that it was just a game) which every her friend in her past had told her due to which she had broken many friendships. The next day I realised that I said very bad things and I should have not told and apologised her but she said that it was too late and she have learned a lesson and would be careful afterwards she also added that I clearly didn't respected her dignity, I got emotional a bit and I admitted that I was wrong and broke the trust but her response was very cold that she don't care and I should also not get affected by what she said, after that I texted her till yesterday but got ignored every time (ik I should have given her space) but I know her very well what she says she don't change her mind. I was completely shocked that what I have done now I am having a guilt and said sorry multiple times to her but she said that no need of sorry I am not angry with you just learned a lesson and I am done with this. Now currently I am thinking about her and cannot get off her from my mind because I used to share small small things in every few hours what happened, and she did the same. Idk but because of my foolishness I lost a best friend in my entire life and idk what to do. How should I stop thinking about her as she lives just in front of my house? Due to this I am even struggling in career (I scored less than 50 percentile).. please help me how can I fix this friendship again as I also don't have friends whom I could ask this... please upvote this and thank you for reading this whomsoever read until here.\n",

Quality time is very much my love language, and it's been really difficult to not have that nearly as much as I want/need in a relationship.

      "Body text: Every time I try to plan outings together, either we are late because she doesn't wake up on time, or she doesn't wake up at all, so it doesn't happen. I dress up all nice and I end up having to undress or go out by myself. We also never get intimate anymore and sometimes I'm pushed away when I try to initiate anything. It made me realize that I an no longer good enough, not attractive enough, nothing. The only time she ever notices me is when I'm being distant because she is. The only time she initiates intimacy is when she knows I'm upset from not getting to spend time together. It's slowly declined to this since we started dating about 5 years ago. I obviously can't and won't force her to do anything she doesn't want to do. But what should I do? Do I change my look to something different and new? Cut my hair short? I can try losing weight but I'm already considered underweight, and I can't seem to gain weight either if that's what the problem is. I don't know what's wrong with me.\n",

      "Body text: So I (25/M) have been dating Megan (24/F) for a little over 3 months (two have been official). Wet met nearly a year ago and had a friend group and we all got along well. Megan was always shy and reserved in the beginning and even when she warmed up she was still closer to the reserved side. She’s also never had a boyfriend before so I’m her first.\n",

      "Recently, I’ve grown frustrated and disappointed about the affection in our relationship. Megan won’t initiate any form of physical touch, literally not even lay a finger on me unless I initiate it. She has only ever once complimented my appearance the whole time we have been seeing each other and she never is the first one to express how she feels about me or being around me. This whole time I have kept telling myself, “hey she’s shy and never had a boyfriend before so it’ll come out eventually.” But she still doesn’t initiate anything I listed, even when it’s just the two of us in a private setting. She also doesn’t plan any dates or hangouts that are just us two. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now recently when I go to touch her, like hold her hand or rub her back, I kinda don’t want to because it’s just me starting it everytime and it just feels one sided. I feel like I’m basically the emotional/physical engine of the relationship and if it wasn’t for me, we basically wouldn’t touch, flirt or compliment each other. We would only do our usual kiss&hug when we first see each other and when we depart. \n",

When he’d done it 4 consecutive nights in a row I begged him to please come sleep next to me because I had Sunday night blues/anxiety and really needed the cuddles/dopamine and he told me he “really just wanted to be sad alone”.\n",

      "For some background, we both have a history of depression (teenage years/early 20s). He also has some pretty bad family trauma from about a decade ago that he’s never sought therapy for and is pretty numb about. I sunk into a bad depression last year and he was incredibly supportive. He called around for a therapy appointment, coaxed me gently out of my bed rotting, and let me cry and talk as much as I needed to. He was so understanding, even when I struggled to understand what was happening myself.\n",

That we have it so good and it’s stupid that he’s feeling sad at all, and that he doesn’t know WHY he’s sad so what’s the point in talking about it. He’s basically now trying to pretend he’s fine when I know that he isn’t. He’s stopped taking care of his health - he hasn’t exercised consistently in weeks and is snacking non-stop, almost obsessively - and he’s gaming in excess with very little quality sleep. Yesterday he didn’t go into work and basically just slept the entire day.\n",

He knows this is bullshit, but also doesn’t seem to have the appetite to change it.\n",

      "Body text: So my girlfriend and I have been dating only for 3 months but have been on and off for roughly a year and 2 months, I really really do love her so much but recently she has told me everything that she was upset about.

A day or two passed and that is when she decided to tell me everything. I wont go into the details of the problems, but essentially it was mostly things which I overlooked and unspoken things which I should have-  we should have talked about previously. I don't want to blame it on my 'lack of experience' as she is essentially my first relationship but most of the things she told me I had no idea actually bugged her, with things that I do understand I may have disregarded but other things I completely had no clue about. While she explained all  this to me, even she herself stated that it was a compilation of things, problems, small and little which she did not talk to me about prior, rather that it built up and became one big problem which may have presented worse than it really was. Even herself saying she may just have been being dramatic yet I understand her fully from her perspective and that I have acknowledged her emotions and that they are completely valid. Because of these issues and especially unspoken things essentially about other girls (I have not cheated or any of the sort, just things in the past), they have had significant impacts to her confidence, self-looks, her trust and overthinking. I again had no idea she was even thinking of things like this until she talked to me about everything.   \n",

I have reassured her that I will learn and given her time and space, I have done everything to try make her feel as loved and as confident as ever, over explained everything to not make her not overthink and simply I have reassured her as much as I can. I just want to know what the next steps I should take, even simple things which can make her feel  just happier, things which can make her not overthink and things that can get her confidence back, anything that can make her feel better.

Some of his socks have holes in them. I want him to put as much effort into how he looks for me as I put in for him, but he just tells me to throw out his shirts that I don't like.

      "Body text: As per the title, my boyfriend is watching porn and I don’t know how to talk to him about the issue. I’ve never brought the issue up before- I knew he sometimes watched it and was never a huge fan, but not enough to talk about it. Unfortunately, porn is so common in the modern age and he’s had a VERY sexually active life before me with a high sex drive, so I brushed it off. Lately though it’s been bothering me a lot. We live together and have been together for a few years now, I love him more than anything, so it’s not enough to tarnish my image of him or anything. But I’ve never had to have this talk with anyone before (especially because we never set this boundary; I’ve never told him I didn’t want him watching porn since I didn’t know it bothered me, and he’s brought it up without me asking him to not.) and I don’t know how to go about it. I think he might also have an OF account which I’m 100% not okay with, but I don’t have solid proof yet so I’m also planning on telling him that I think OF subscriptions are akin to cheating (which I know will make him immediately unsubscribe. He’s been cheated on and had his heart beyond shattered from it and is a genuinely good guy, so I don’t think he quite understands that subscribing to other women’s sexual content can be seen as cheating until I explain it to him). We’ve never had any fights before ever since both of us are the kind to immediately talk about any issues and we’re incredibly open and honest with each other, so I want to absolutely let him know before resentment builds or I accidentally snap and get grumpy. Advice and tips for this conversation are absolutely appreciated! \n",

      "I've gone to my boyfriend saying Im not sure how to go about trying to lose weight sometimes because I really haven't had much exercise as bad as it sounds and he said maybe we can do walks together (even on days we aren't hanging out, like try to go on walks or something around the same time) but onto the main thing..\n",
      "\n",
      "We were texting this morning and it came up my boyfriend was gonna go on walks more because it feels like he's dying, he's been so tired and he feels like he's actively dying. I didnt pry into this much but I wanted to support him and help him any way I can. I didnt bring up anything like cutting alcohol (as he is trying to drink less when he does but I think he needs to stop completely for his health, I'm worried about his liver) or weight as he's a bit bigger which i love personally but I truly want to make sure he is healthy. Him saying he felt like he was dying scared me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I bring this up? Im not sure how and i just don't want it to seem attacking or anything when its stuff he may already know he has to do and is aware of. Im just so worried about him because I truly love him and want him to be around for a long long time. He's only 25 and I don't wanna see him having health issues like I do already at 21. :'(\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR bf made a comment saying he felt like he was actively dying as he has zero energy and I'm worried about his health (he drinks and his a bit on the heavier side) I don't want him to get liver issues or worse. How do I go about this to try and help. (More indepth details in post, kinda hard to shorten)\n",

      "Title: I (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) are in a very loving relationship, but I can't help feeling drained and sometimes a lot of quiet fatigue and anger at him. Is it something I need to fix within myself, or something we should change?\n",
      "Body text: I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for a few months, after a close friendship that turned into a relationship. He’s incredibly sweet. He cooks for me, takes care of me when I’m sick, planned a dream Valentine's day date, and genuinely tries to be a good partner. I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways, he really *shows up*. We've spilled our souls to each other and he knows about my past and my mental health and chronic illness struggles. I grew up with some very traumatic events in my childhood and destructive and abusive relationships at young ages, and he never shamed me or made me feel any less for it. It's all I wanted in someone and never thought I could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite all that, I’m starting to feel like I’m slowly disappearing in this relationship. He follows me everywhere, literally. In every social situation, at university, with friends, to my alone time. People now barely even know me outside of just expecting him to be there, and I feel like I’ve lost a lot of my identity and independence trying to accommodate him. It’s not that he’s controlling at all. He’s just… *there*. All the time. And emotionally very dependent on me. He’s also had a hard, traumatic past with bullying and doesn't have many close friends at all, and I so understand why he craves closeness, but I’m starting to feel like his emotional anchor, his mirror, and his support system, while barely holding myself together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve tried talking to him about needing space, and he *does* listen. But then the cycle repeats. I end up explaining myself over and over or becoming unwell just to be allowed to rest or have time alone. He gets slightly cold takes it personally even when he says he doesn’t. And the guilt is killing me, even when he says to me to not be guilty. Because I love that he always wants to be with me. That he tells me I'm always in his plans. And I know I'm young, we both are, though we've met each others' parents and are very seriously dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a growing disconnect in how we see the world. He has somewhat rigid ideas about his role \"as a man\": he insists on always paying for everything (despite us both being students), never letting me carry emotional weight, and acting like he has to suffer in silence to protect me. I know it comes from a caring place, but I want an equal in a partner. I tell him so often I want him to have a safe place in me and he says he does and that I don't have to go it alone either.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the same with how we think. We’re in the same science/medical degree, but I’m also very poetic, abstract, and creative. He jokes that it’s all “humanities nerd shit.” He’s very logical, very black-and-white in his thinking, and sometimes I feel like the parts of me that matter most (my voice, my way of seeing, the soft and strange language I live in) just don’t land with him. He’s not cruel. He’s not homophobic (I'm bisexual, he just doesn't know this) I don’t feel unsafe, I just feel subtly unseen. I find myself toning down my queerness, my language, my culture (he's White and i'm South Asian), my softness around him, just to make the air more breathable. And after a while, that’s exhausting. He says I don't seem \"overly sensitive like all those people\", but I've always been very tender-hearted and empathetic, it's like I've been dulling it around him like I do with the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him. He’s kind. He treats me so well, with so much care. But I feel like I’m suffocating. I really don’t want to break up or take space from him, I believe in nuance, and growing and changing. But I don’t want to lose myself either. I've noticed a decrease in my desire to spend time with him (sometimes even dreading it) or to cuddle or be physically intimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I handle this? I've communicated with him as nicely as possible for taking my own time off or making separate plans, and sometimes when he's joked about things or said things that I find upsetting (not maliciously, we both like our dark humour), I've let myself express that I don't want to. I've noticed a lot of my friendships fade, being simultaneously so happy and light with how he treats me and then heavy and crying my guts out. I want to make sure his needs are met and he receives the love and care and friendship he never got. But I can't help feeling I've lost my light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR:** I (19F) love my boyfriend (18M), he’s incredibly kind, attentive, and emotionally available, and he’s shown up for me in ways I never thought anyone would. But I’m starting to feel like I’m slowly disappearing in the relationship. He’s extremely emotionally dependent on me, constantly by my side, and I’m losing my independence, identity, and even my desire to be around him. I also feel like I have to tone down my queerness, softness, culture, and creativity to stay compatible with his more rigid, logical worldview. I don’t want to leave him, he’s a good person: but I’m exhausted, and I’m scared of losing myself completely. How do I navigate this without hurting him/not meeting his needs or abandoning myself?\n",

In other words, it's like she's stuck in her own head. When we do call, sometimes I'll be there for the beginning process of her getting stuck, but then she'll stay stuck.

      "I'm a very talkative person, but it's more like I'll spontaneously talk about topics that intrigue me (this is how she prefers it, because when I ask her questions it's hard for her to verbally speak).

      "Title: [25M] Still finding it hard to trust GF [23F], my gut won't let me?\n",
      "Body text: I met my girlfriend (24F) last year in September. We clicked well, and by January 2025 we made things official. I genuinely like her. She's fun, smart, and we get along. But there’s a major issue I’ve been struggling with that I can’t seem to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "From early on, she would talk a lot about her male friends. She’s in university, and they’re all part of the same friend group of about ten people. As things started progressing between us, around three months into knowing her, she began dropping hints about wanting a relationship and asked if I was planning to make things official. For context, I’ve never been in a relationship before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since she often mentioned these male friends, and I was seriously considering a relationship with her, I wanted to understand what those dynamics were like. So I asked if she had ever had anything sexual or romantic with any of them. She told me no, not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to January. I ask her to be my girlfriend, and on that very same day, she tells me that actually:\n",
      "\n",
      "• She had sex with Guy A four times (up to 2023)  \n",
      "• She had sex with Guy B twice (last time was early 2024)  \n",
      "• She gave Guy C head once (in 2022)\n",
      "\n",
      "This completely blindsided me. I was shocked because I had explicitly asked her about this before, and she lied. Her reasoning was that she didn’t think it was important to tell me at the time. Of course, I didn’t believe that. She was fully aware she was concealing it because she knew it would be an issue, especially since she wanted a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her I wasn’t sure I could continue the relationship after finding out in this way. She got emotional, cried, said she really wanted to be with me, that I had nothing to worry about, and that she’d do anything to rebuild my trust. I didn’t end things, but I was clear that I wouldn't feel comfortable being around these guys or with her spending time with them. At the same time, I told her I wasn’t going to try to control who she sees. I’m not her parent. I just personally hoped she'd distance herself a bit on her own accord out of respect for our relationship. She said she understood and took that on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the dynamics are not the same in terms of me being in a friend group with my past hookups, I don’t maintain contact with anyone I’ve been with. I could, but I don’t see why I’d need or want to if I have a girlfriend. None of what I’m putting up with is mirrored from my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, she’s been very vocal about loving me and how much I mean to her. It’s just hard to fully believe. It still bothers me. Every time she brings up one of their names, says she’s going to an event where one or more of them will be, or one of them calls her about work or trip planning, I feel weird.\n",

I kept wondering what that guy thought, especially knowing he’s friends with the other two she was involved with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before that party, she had asked me if I’d be okay with her going to another event where Guy C would be. When I seemed hesitant, she acknowledged she didn’t want to overload me and decided not to go. (I mentioned to her i don't want to feel like a burden and hinder her from doing things she wants to do, if she wants to not do things, it should rather be off her own accord out of respect for the relationship)\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that also plays on my mind is that I don’t know the tone of her conversations with these guys. I haven’t snooped on her phone or anything, so I’m left speculating.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s adamant that her relationships with them are purely platonic now (we've heard how this plays out since the beginning of time...). She even said the only way anything would happen again with any of them is if she were to be ... (extreme way to put it).\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I’m not trying to control her or micromanage her friendships. But the initial dishonesty, the fact that these guys are still in her close circle, and how casually she seems to treat it all, makes it really hard for me to feel comfortable. I also feel more invested now because her family knows me and is fond of me and vice versa.\n",

My girlfriend’s brother told his mom that the only thing he wanted was that she wouldn’t do this with his siblings and that she should be more open. His mom said that she won’t and that she would want them to be happy. I don’t know if she was serious or not, but that’s what was the last conversation about it. \n",

      "Body text: Let me start off with we are both Sophomores (F16) (M16) in High school, so already pretty young. We have been dating for 8 months now. Lately I have had waves of anger and jealousy towards her and this I believe stems from the things she has said to me. A few days ago I told her that I was going to a school volleyball event and that there were two girls on the team. Thinking this would be okay because obviously I am not there to be with other girls. Keep in mind having them is required to join. She freaked out on my friend, saying \"fuck him\" and eventually \"fuck you\" to me for wanting to go. \n",

      "She was mad she wasn't invited since I was going.  Here is why I am totally confused. She does track and she openly tells me that she talks to other guys there (not romantically). She says it is fine because it is a sport. I argued that this event was also a sport but apparently that doesn't matter. Then she too signed up for the event with her sister and the team has 4 guys on the team. I don't mind that but then she has the audacity to say she is still upset that I will be going with a group of girls (two of them).  I brought up that she would be going with guys and her response was that it was okay because they were Seniors. \n",

      "For a while she has been fighting depression. It has taken a huge toll on me and I doubt I can handle it longer. Everyday she calls herself fat and of course I reassure her but that is getting tiring. I can't change her opinion. Every time I am out with friends and more recently when I was having son-dad time, she texted me that she was in a bad mental state lately.

From meeting when we were young in a physically and mentally demanding job while struggling to survive, to going long distance for work then being thrown into the pandemic losing everything we had and not seeing each other for almost a year, to him moving in and getting hired at the same company, then I was hit with some more intense medical issues that he fully supported me through, I ended up losing my job bc of my health and he didn’t get a contract renewal so we packed up and found opportunities elsewhere. Since then we’ve been living together and working together at a fairly high stress job where just barely a year ago our abusive boss was fired. It’s been a lot. We’ve been through a lot (not even including the shit from before we met) It felt like after we went long distance it’s been life changing challenge after life changing challenge.\n",

In the last year I’ve gotten very reactive, defensive, impulsive, inconsistent, not putting effort in, not understanding, bad communication, no memory, and honestly pretty inconsiderate and mean. Last year, the start of our downward spiral, I really dropped the ball on his bday and it ended with him wanting to break up and me promising I’d do better (not cheating, but did traumatize him by passing out (wasn’t properly taking care of myself and was 100% preventable) in a packed public place and derailing the rest of the trip and his bday. This was right after a big fight about a week earlier and things were already a little hairy between us). Cut to a month later, and guess what? I pull the same shit, don’t give him enough care and support then make what could’ve been small into me being crazy reactive and defensive. I lost control. During these next months I proceed to make the same mistakes over and over again, and each argument with him practically begging me to do better and asking for change, and me getting more reactive and defensive.\n",

I know I have a lot going on medically/mentally and that definitely contributes to my hardships, but I never rise above it all. I let it pull me down. Then I get real comfortable in that low pit and use my health/brain as an excuse and have been extremely lenient with myself and lazy.

I’m slinging this guy around horribly and he’s done. It’s been almost a year of this now and nothing has improved. I have for the most part completely stagnated.

I’ve diminished and dismissed his emotions and mental health and made him not feel as safe coming to me for support. I haven’t been giving him the love and care that he deserves. I’ve been reactive and loud angry in public (embarrassing and really immature of me). I’ve made big goals and promised fixes but with no follow up effort or results. I don’t communicate my wants and needs well or at all then burst out upset that whatever need isn’t getting met while he’s just come to me to communicate his wants and needs or for emotional support. I am emotionally immature (he said I was a half baked adult and that’s the truth). Honestly I could keep going. I truly have no redeemable traits at this point. I’ve had nothing but time to get better, but instead I’ve been stuck in the same 3-4 week cycle of things being better for a bit then I sabotage everything and we have to start over again.

      "My gf has PTSD and ADHD, she can't sleep normally, she has a lot of trouble being on time to things, getting things done, being in certain social settings, and often makes small mistakes that others wouldn't. What I'm saying is that she doesn't fully have control in her life, and that bothers me. I am the complete opposite, very structured and organized, always ambitious and working towards my career. I enjoy having things done right and at the right time and its unsettling when they aren't. I do not blame her for anything she does or the way that she is, she is an amazing person for so many reasons and she tries so hard to fix these problems in her life. I always support her in her troubles but sometimes I feel that my needs aren't met or that a life with her may not be what I want for myself and my future. I believe a big contribution towards this deep discomfort is the gradual resentment I have built over time. Since I wouldn't want to tell her that her actions bother me, I keep them to myself. Obviously this does not work and creates greater problems down the road which we are now understanding. We have been discussing how we both feel in depth for the past few weeks but can't manage to reach any sort of conclusion or next step. We are not fighting, we care deeply about each other and want to resolve this, but my discomfort can't be satisfied.\n",

      "Title: My girlfriend wants to break up because she doesn’t feel the same—what should I do?\n",
      "Body text: Hello everyone, I’m 24 years old, and I’ve been in a relationship with my 23-year-old girlfriend for 1.5 years. This is my first relationship by choice. I’ve had many opportunities in the past, but I intentionally avoided them because I realized that I didn’t feel a strong connection with those people. When I met my girlfriend, we started a long-distance relationship, traveling back and forth between our towns (I traveled more due to my remote job). I’ve even stayed with her for weeks or months at a time. Over the course of our relationship, we’ve learned a lot about each other—both the good and the bad—and we’ve rarely had any arguments. We have a lot of respect for each other, and for the people around us, and we’re both calm and respectful individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "We share many interests that not many people have, and we often see things the same way. We’re both flexible people and have traveled extensively abroad. However, three months ago, she moved abroad for Erasmus (a six-month university exchange program). After I visited her two months ago, I noticed she started becoming a bit distant. (After I came back from that trip). After some days, she told me she didn’t know why, and I began to wonder if she might have met someone else. But I know her well, and she’s one of the most faithful people I know, so I couldn’t imagine that happening. A few days later, she assured me that she hadn’t found anyone else, and that she was dealing with some internal issues, not knowing why she felt this way. She also told me I didn't do anything wrong on our trip or before. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, she wanted to break up, but I suggested we wait for a month until she could visit me. When she came to see me for two days, we had a great time together, and she told me she didn’t want me to be her ex, but someone very important in her life. She expressed that she wanted us to stay in touch and have language exchange lessons every week. We spent time together at the beach, slept together like we did before, and when it was time for her to leave, she kissed me twice and said “I love you”—something she hadn’t said in two months. We agreed to meet again in 3-4 weeks, but I’m not sure what the future holds.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seems very conflicted with her feelings. She even mentioned that maybe she needs psychiatric help because she feels so good with me, but she doesn’t understand why she’s feeling this way. She said that I’m near perfect and that it’s the first time she’s met someone so good, which is why she wanted to break up. She feels like I give her more love than she can reciprocate at the moment. I’m not sure whether to wait, as I’m hoping things will get better when she returns home. I also think that the current distance between us is a big problem, even though she insists it isn’t.\n",

Now I have no problem with porn itself as I watch it myself sometimes. It is just my partner's porn use that freaks me out as I'm not used to being with someone with a healthy relationship with porn and I am so scared that he is going to have a similar mindset as my ex and not view me in a healthy way, and that I will relive that experience all over again. Which I know likely isn't true but it's still in my mind. I want to open up to my bf about this and get this off my chest but I don't how to do it in a way that isn't accusatory and doesn't sound like I'm crazy. Any advice would be appreciated as it is just difficult to explain this specific trauma to someone who probably has no idea about it\n",

My GF’s step mother died so it was a hard time for her, she threatened to kill herself, spread rumours that I was still infatuated with my EX (loose term) and hurt herself that night. She was put in the hospital. I was under a lot of distress and Sophie reached out to me regarding these rumours. I sorted shit with her and the convo got off topic. I tried comforting Sophie’s own suicidal thoughts and told her to always reach out to me. We also joked around but I clarified I had no feelings for her. Whenever my GF was mentioned, I avoided it because of the shit she caused me with the rumours and how she broke up with me before her attempt. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bribed Soph 10 dollars not to tell my GF because I was under a lot of stress that night and my words could be seen as flirty or with  ulterior motives. My GF was discharged, I was so happy to be able to talk to her and I didn’t tell her of this interaction and only showed her half of it until 2 days later. It was a fucking mess when I did and she sent a nasty msg to Soph.\n",
      "\n",
      "My 4 relationship after has been so stressful. I know breaking up is an option I’ve considered but I think with the shit we’ve been through we seem glued together in our familiarity and comfort we get from eachother. GF says she constantly relives this memory she had of me betraying her, from what I think is amplified by her step mother’s death and how blown out of proportion it was that makes her demonise it so much. I feel so fucking bad for talking to Sophie. Over the next few months after, my girlfriend tormented me, asking me to cut for her. She kept asking if I missed Soph and one day I admitted I did (in an attempt to look at a non biased way) but took it back a couple days later because I believe that’s what I didn’t feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "My GF says she feels it in waves, she loves me so much but our happiness is overcome by what I’ve done and the events after that where the relationship was really really toxic. And because of these waves she can’t truly leave me because she doesn’t have a definite hatred to me that can compel her to. I just have a sickly attachment to her because we both still love eachother but it gets on my nerves so much her mentioning this incident and asking about it 5 years later on\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I spoke to my ex twice when we were 14 and 15 under strange circumstances which made it seem I wasn’t over her. My GF found out because I didn’t tell her and it’s been 5 years and we have a horrible attachment to eachother where we cant leave. \n",

This is my second serious relationship, and this is her first healthy relationship given she was cheated on by her boyfriends in the past. I’ve done so much for her in such a short time, we’ve done everything together. I’ve always given her constant reassurance on insecurities and what she thinks her flaws are. In the past she has told me when she is angry or upset, she would isolate and not talk to the person until she has a clear mind. From the beginning I established communication and boundaries for a healthy relationship. One of those boundaries being throwing me on do not disturb. I understand being busy, and IM not entitled to all her time, but there was times where I wouldn’t be able to communicate because of it.\n",

But i need to know if its unhealthy or healthy or anything that needs to be fixed. Our relationship used to be really nice and normal with us having conversations and i have to do things every so often but my dad sadly isnt the most lenient so he sometimes takes my phone all day or randomly for no reason for a few hours to make me do chores that my brother just decided not to do. Sometimes he takes it for absolutely no reason and makes me just sit and think of how miserable my life is after he yells at me and calls me many different things that i cant say on here and just leaves me with no one to comfort me or anything. Ive been incredibly stressed about the constant working i have to do at home from my dad, and i get anxious from the things he calls me and i panic. Me and my girlfriend barely get to talk but 20 minutes a day and for a young relationship i would like more time to have love from the one place i can get it. Our relationship is filled with arguments over our anxiety and with no actual quality time spent with my girlfriend, it feels like im not even dating her anymore. I also have severe derealization diagnosed to me so that affects our relationship too i truly dont know whats wrong and just want to know if theres a way to fix it.\n",

      "Body text: My (27F) gf (24F) is adamant abt not deleting an old conversation w her ex for the reason that she doesnt normally do it, and she is hesitant abt changing this one thing abt herself just bc she is now in a relationship. Thing is, im insecure abt her relnship w her ex because i just found out that while they were broken up for months, they were still talking (initiated by her after the breakup bc she was flying somewhere and it had terrible turbulence and that she couldnt bear the fact that she wasnt gonna see her ex anymore) and even brought up the idea of maybe trying again when she gsts back home. And then she met me. Even when we were first hanging out, they were still talking she said, but not as often anymore. i was hurt bc im normally hesitant abt getting in relationships w people that had fairly just broken up bc im afraid they havent fully moved on. on top of that, she met with her ex when she came bck home (her ex is in the same country as her and im not, for the ldr context) while we were already together. but i just found out about it last month. she said she felt like she owed it to her to honor that promise (they promised to meet each other when she came back, before she met me) and thats when she finally made it clear to her that theres no future between them because she has me now. she felt guilty for talking to her again only for them not to get back together anymore. ofc i was hurt by the fact that she didnt tell me, but i forgave her not bc of her words, but by how she has been treating me and how she made me feel. and i believe that.\n",

      "so i dont know, is it valid for me to get upset that she chooses not to delete the convo especially when there are spicy photos there? she says theyre not explicit, just in underwears but it doesnt rlly matter bc she never rereads them, views them, nevwr reallt thouhht abt it anymore until i brought it up. idc how explicit the photos are but the intention of them is what irks me. she says she doesnt see how it affects her regarding our relnship but acknowledges how it affects me in thjs relationship.\n",

      "am i being to unreasonable and childish for feeling upset abt this? i dont want to cntrol her in any way, i just said that this is what this makes me feel and i wanted her to know. she says that its not that she doesnt want to delete them, its just that she doesnt see the point. and if she deletes bc im upset, i guess she feels manipulated to a point. is it valid that im feeling upset bc i feel like she should be trying more in rebuilding that trust w me bc her lying (by omission) was the reason im insecure abt it now? or is her autonomy as important still?\n",

He was the first to ask me out and I decided to give it a shot because I hadn't been in a real relationship before and figured if it didn't work out I would just go back to normal since I don't have the mentality that I need one to complete me. Recently my partner casually dropped in passing that he sees us as lifelong partners and the prospect scares me a little. There's nothing wrong with him and I don't see any red flags I just wasn't expecting it and it still feels too early for me to tell if that's what I want. I get the general sense that he is looking for a life partner, someone to be with until he dies but I don't know if I want the same thing. Especially considering we're both at different life stages and I don't feel like I've figured myself out in terms of my own independence and dont want to completely rely on him if things go south. I'm not saying I don't like him, he's lovely so far and I don't see reasons to end things.

      "Body text: \n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "My husband (32M) and I (29F) have been married since 2019 and have two kids. He works overseas while I manage our small business at home. A few months ago, I found out he cheated on me twice and used drugs. I forgave him for the sake of our children. Now, he’s become extremely jealous and paranoid to the point it’s affecting my mental health and well-being. I’m exhausted and considering separation, but I’m scared he might hurt himself if I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I have been married for 6 years. We have two young children. Right now, he’s working overseas, and I manage a small business back home with a team of six employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I encouraged him to work abroad because when he was still here, he didn’t take our business or family responsibilities seriously. He acted like he was still single—spending time with friends and hobbies while I did most of the work. I hoped that sending him abroad would help him become more responsible, especially since his father also works there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months ago, I found out he had cheated on me—not once, but twice—and was also using drugs. I was devastated and angry, and I wanted to leave. But because of our kids, and my hope to keep our family together, I forgave him after a month. He did ask for forgiveness, though it felt more like a formality than genuine remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, his jealousy has grown worse. One incident really triggered everything: I asked one of our staff members—who happens to be my cousin’s husband—to drive me to the town for groceries. It’s a long trip, and I usually take 4–5 hours because of how far and spread out everything is. Splitting tasks with him (he’d go to the market, I’d go to the grocery) helped us get done faster. My husband knew about this in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after that, he became obsessive. He constantly asks things like:\n",
      "“Why him?”\n",
      "“Is he handsome?”\n",
      "“Are you cheating with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after I stopped asking for help from male staff and brought a female staff member instead, the questions didn’t stop. It’s now become a daily routine—accusations, jealousy, arguments. Every time I go out, I feel like I have to defend myself for doing nothing wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "What hurts the most is that I never treated him this way when he cheated. I stayed silent, kept the pain to myself, and forgave him. But now I’m being treated like the guilty one. His accusations feel like punishment I don’t deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he’s demanding that I fire my cousin’s husband, saying it’s the only way he’ll feel “at peace.” But this man did nothing wrong. He’s a valuable worker—he handles our maintenance, electrical, and plumbing needs—and it’s very difficult to find someone else with those skills. My mother, who also helps with the business, doesn’t agree with firing him either. Plus, this man has a wife and child who rely on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my husband is not just jealous—he’s angry and hurting because he can’t be here. I think he’s projecting his guilt and pain onto me.

      "Title: How could I move on after my (26F) high school friend (26F) got engaged to my college boyfriend (25F)? (Read to see why this a coincidence x 4)\n",
      "Body text: All names have been changed.\n",

      "Hi I'm Roxanne and I'm 26. I was lonely growing up. For 15 years, I was basically around the same crowd, was bullied a lot, and didn't really have any friends at school. (I'm autistic, but didn't know that until my 20s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I was 15 and about to go into my sophomore year of high school. I had a kaleidoscope-thing that time (it's probably still lying around somewhere) and for some reason I was convinced that thing could grant wishes. Tired of being lonely, I held up my kaleidoscope-thing and made a wish that a new girl would come on our first day of school, and that she would be pretty and blonde and like horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, that was my standard of friendship that time. I was going through a horse phase at 15, and wanted a blonde best friend since I have dark hair. Anyway, my first class of sophomore year was Math at the new building. AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED? A pretty blonde new girl Hannah comes in, introduces herself, and the first fun fact she says about herself is \"I like horses.\" I AM NOT MAKING THIS SHIT UP. Maybe I was onto something when I thought that kaleidoscope grants wishes. But that is only coincidence #1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah and I did become friends, although not very close, and all in all I was still lonely. But in a few years we graduated, and I was so glad high school was over and I was so ready to move on. I had applied to a college in Colorado and got in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving to Colorado was life changing for me. All of a sudden I had a great support system that I never found in my home state. I was on the college swim team, a biology major, took lots of interesting courses, and met a lot of interesting people. I got a group of best girl friends who I still talk to!\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, I got a boyfriend. His name is Ricardo. (I was 20 at the, he was 19). He was from Reynosa, Mexico. He was as close to perfect as a boy could get. He was ambitious, hoping to put his neuroscience major into good use and had plans of finding cures and saving people. Neither of us would smoke, drink, or swear. He was the type that complained about getting a 99 on a test instead of 100. Athletic, handsome, kind, caring, hilarious. He used to text me things like \"**hopefully I can make the snow more enjoyable for you.\"** (I came from a state where it doesn't snow.) One time he asked me what my favorite candy was, and after I said \"Reese's\", he showed up in front of my classroom with a bag full of them. For Halloween, he was Ron and I was Hermoine. And so on and so forth. I could keep going on about Ricardo, but this would be a really long post.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could probably guess where this was headed. We broke up. More specifically, he broke up with me out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that was back in 2018. I've since moved on, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidence #2: I found out Hannah had transferred to the same college as me. Ugh, I didn't want anything reminding me of high school, but I was still kind of glad to see her. We would see each other in passing on campus, text every now and then, and say things like, \"We should catch up soon!\" But how many times have you told someone you'll \"catch up\" and then actually hung out with them? Exactly. That's what I thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was all before covid hit. (I was one of those extremely lucky 2021 grads). And I had more or less forgotten about most of my pre-covid acquaintances, unless I still regularly talked to them. It seems like that was the case for many people regarding Covid too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coincidence #3; Recently though, reconnected with Mike and David, who were members of our \"squad\" along with Ricardo. (We had all kind of drifted after Covid and graduation). I couldn't help but ask how Ricardo was doing after all those years (unfortunately, we hadn't broken up on good terms, had blocked each other on social media, etc). Mike let me know that Ricardo is dating a girl named Hannah now and they got an apartment together in New Jersey. Wait, *that* Hannah?? It couldn't be. It just couldn't. Life couldn't be that cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bring me to Coincidence #4. I was on vacation in Maui with my parents, a 26 year old woman basically 3rd wheeling two 54 year olds. It was then that I saw a couple on the beach that caught my eye. The girl had long shiny blonde hair and was wearing a striped swimsuit. Could it really be them? But I was too for away, and I didn't have my contacts in, and was not 100% sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Ricardo blocked me, and Hannah barely ever used social media the whole time I knew her, I looked up her mom. (Weird, I know). Sure enough, it really was Ricardo and Hannah on the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. THIS IS JUST MIND BLOWING. There is a 0.000001 % chance of something like this happening, and yet it did. Reddit, please help. I can't stop crying. Why would life treat me like this? I don't understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if I ever find that old kaleidoscope thing in my pile of stuff, I'll wish that my heart will heal. (Oh, and also that he'll accidentally say \"Roxanne\" on one of their dates).\n",

      "Title: I (17F) am struggling to communicate with my boyfriend (17M) who’s seemed to have changed his personality to fit his friends.\n",
      "Body text: So, my boyfriend is 17 and I am too, we’ve been dating for two years and we live together in our own apartment already. We had an argument a few days ago and I feel like it’s completely ruined us, it got so bad I went to my friends house for a night and he went away to do some revision for a college exam with a friend. I told my friend about the argument and she was completely understanding and there for me, I don’t want to get into to much detail about it or else I’ll start to feel negative again but when I read text messages I read them with a tone and he didn’t quite understand that, so a few messages he sent had quite an awful tone to it and I got really upset with him, he called me irrational and overly sensitive for reading messages with a tone or getting hurt over a message - his friends agreed with him, when I came back from my friends I decided to sit on the balcony and sunbathe listening to a podcast to calm myself down and he told his friends that I was just sitting there, they suggested (as a joke) “push her off”, and they said “are you the one to always fix things?” and he said “yes”. When in-fact whenever there’s an argument I always go to him and try to communicate my feelings and apologise but he doesn’t understand how complex and intense my feelings get. So, I waited this out on the balcony until it started to rain and I set up the sofa like a bed, then at the end he came to me for once. They just all are so immature I feel and the fact he’s surrounding himself with these people is impacting him negatively I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to sound awful to say but I really hate his friends, I’m from England so you may not be too particular with the term “chavs” or “roadmen” if you’re not from here but they have a very identifiable way of talking and dressing, they sag their pants so their boxes stick out, they were fake gucci crossbody bags and big puffer jackets. As we unfortunately live in area notifiable for them types of people he’s surrounded by them at his work and at his college, he’s started to pick up they way they talk and it disgusts me.\n",
      "\n",
      "They call women “tings” which basically is objectifying and translates to “things”. The friend he revised with referred to himself as a “serial cheater” which already is self explanatory, this friend also gambles and wants to take my boyfriend with him when he turns 18 which I’m so extremely against. I feel I should mention that my mental health is at such a crippling point right now, I have horrible anxiety (it’s so bad I throw up every time I feel nervous) and i’m getting diagnosed for ADHD - I struggle to do basic tasks including looking after myself. So, with that little bit of context my boyfriend tries to do catch up on the housework I struggle to do which I admit I feel so guilty everyday and I feel useless and he says that it’s okay and he doesn’t mind looking after me. I’ve started to try pick my feet up a bit more and help out when I can but at college he refers to me as “lazy” and that I sit at home all day, so his friends call me lazy and say “Do I need to show her how to do the dishes” and he’s still friends with these people.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all say negative things about me and just women in general, and one of these friends who made the dishes comment is actually a women, the complete opposite of what a women should be saying - why is she encouraging women to be the cleaners? They’re all very sexist and have a very dull and small minded way of thinking, they think I should be the one cleaning and cooking and I told my boyfriend he needs to defend me but he says it’s hard because “they don’t understand mental health” but he encourages their jokes. It especially hurts because when he encourages these jokes or they encourage him, they tell him to “put me in my place” yet when I go meet him after work or college and they’re there they all shut up around me and act all quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel really hurt by these things and especially because of the argument where I brought up all these things and I don’t know, I’m just lost. He’s changed so much and I can’t tell if it’s for the worse, I feel like it is, he refers to me as a “ting” sometimes or calls me the b word (censored for reddit rules) as a joke. He says things like “Nahh that’s mad G” and it just sounds so childish, I’m from London so my vocabulary (when I want it to be) is quite I guess posh so I absolutely hate when he talks like this and it doesn’t feel like he’s himself anymore. He changes his sense of humour so it’ll fit his friends (chavs) like pretending he forces me to cook and clean or put me in my place or calling women “nah she’s fine g” they’re just so sexist so then when he comes from work or college it just doesn’t feel like we can connect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really don’t know what to do in this situation, I know I’ve changed too but that’s because of my mental health, I can’t control when something goes wrong in my life and has a negative crippling affect. I’m always there for him even when I feel like I’m drowning in my own emotions and he’s always been there for me but the more he’s around these people he’s just slowly disappearing and I’m starting to feel alone in this relationship. I have to ask him to cuddle me when I just want to be held, whenever i’m upset he just sits on tiktok laying next to me even when i’m crying and I have to say “Baby, i’m really upset why aren’t you comforting me”. I’m a very sensitive and emotional person so I feel things really like intense is the word I guess.\n",

      "Body text: I met her thru online dating. We clique really well and I never had any intention taking advantage of her. At the start we became a couple really quick out of desperation. The first year there wasn’t any love or much meet up just simply texting each other daily. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The third year our love grows deeper, we care for each other alot more and I helped her thru out her life. Whatever she need. Emotionally , financially , life lesson ( I been thru alot and seen alot since I was 13yo) and teach her what I think on things as well as. Never once enforce my opinions on her but just to let her know how I think of certain things with proper facts & explanation. We grew closer & closer and our love for each other started taking deeper roots. I’m someone who always thinks that I need to be strong so people can depend on me, rely on me. I never once thought for myself. My sadness , loneliness , anger or any negative emotions I kept it to myself. I have always been her ‘teacher’ , ‘fixer’ , ‘decision maker’ & her support. She never truly support me emotionally but I never once notice or cared about it . I thought I can pull thru like I always do with life. \n",
      "\n",
      " The fourth year , we grew even more. We planned our future together , what we want and what’s our goal . I never asked anything for myself , I only wanted her to be happy. I build myself around her and never knew this is a mistake which makes her even more dependant on me. Life goes on and we became what people would call us ‘ like an old sweet couple’ . We trusted each other and never once doubted. She’s open with her emotion whereas I’m not. As I have once did , she cried and broke down. And I had to comfort her instead even thou I was in a very bad space. I tried opening a few times & the result was the same. This made me close my emotions and never truly shows her because it will be easier if I just keep it to myself & recover on my own like always. \n",

      "We argued here and there like any couples. I told her before that I’m tired. Tired emotionally and couldn’t hold on any longer. She promised to change but never did.

      "On today’s date. 3-4 months ago I realise what I truly wanted. I needed a partner that can walk beside me and not behind me. I wanted someone that can help me with a solution.

I had a great relationship with her family, and she was working on hers with mine. We were planning to spend the rest of our lives together. Until this past weekend.

      "Me and my boyfriend have been together since August and we immediately spent sooooo much time together. After a few months I stayed at his house every night for about a month straight, and I’m currently in between getting a place because my lease ended and the apartment I want will be ready end of this month, so I’ve been staying at his house basically every night the past month and a half or so. When I was talking about getting my own place he joked around a couple times about me just moving in with him but it never was a super serious discussion, and I always shot down the idea pretty fast because it felt too soon. However, now that I’ve been here about a month and a half already our relationship is in a GREAT place and it feels like we love each other more and more everyday! That being said I really want to have the conversation about me just moving in with him but don’t really know how to bring it up. A big point I want to make, and a big point that was frustrating for me in the past is I really wouldn’t be thrilled to be put in the same situation I was with my last apartment where I was paying 1200+ a month to just spend every night at his place. I don’t see us breaking up anytime soon and we love being together and it just seems this is the most logical move to make I just don’t really know how to say it or what to say, any advice would be so helpful , thanks!\n",

      "I (M, 48) am in a 2 year relationship with someone (F, early 50's) who is married but separated. We started dating while they were living together but sleeping in separate beds, as things got more serious or frequent between us, she told him she wanted to separate from him and he moved out. We have continued the relationship and I eventually started therapy to deal with my feelings around her still being married (I come from a divorced family and my mother has been married multiple times, so I do have some issues). Things were going great, there were a couple of issues that arose that were hard for me to deal with, usually involving finances, owning a house together, etc..but I was able to talk through them and realize why I react the way I do surrounding those issues. I know she loves me, so it is not a romantic jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now, we had just gotten back from a wonderful 2 month roadtrip while between jobs and a few weeks after our return she learned that her husband has cancer. He is someone who doesn't have close friends who could help and no family to help, so she stepped in. She was there at the hospital for the surgery, he recovered at her place for a week or two. He is now back at his own apartment but he will soon start radiation and chemo treatment and the outcomes are unknown, but I imagine he will need help during the treatment, but I have not dealt with chemo or radiation so I have no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am having a hard time with this. I have never said \"I love you\" to her because it has been hard for me to let myself go there while she remains married, which I have talked to her about more than once. I feel like this is my hangup and my problem because I know she isn't interested in him romantically, but considers him a part of the family. I really want to move on from the marriage hangup I have, but I am scared I will continually put up my guard romantically and psychologically. I know it seems like a red flag, but life is complicated and dealing with financial issues is hard and not fun, so I understand why they haven't legally divorced. She has told me that she hasn't done more in the direction of a divorce because I am not affectionate enough, which is true and related to my inability to say \"I love you\". But telling me that feels unfair as I think she should be dealing more with the divorce regardless of being in a relationship with me or anyone, but I also understand that maybe she needs to feel more secure before taking those hard steps. I did finally tell her the other night that I did love her. It almost feels like she comes with him, and I have to accept that. I am mature enough to accept someone being in a friendship with their ex's, at least I thought I was. Am I being stubborn? It feels like I am just shut out of that part of her life. Which I could live with if they were completely split off from each other, but they aren't. I don't know what to do. I know a part of myself has not allowed myself to love her fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in my late 40's now, I have never worked on a relationship as hard as I have this one. I feel like if I break up with her, I am just giving up on us and all relationships are hard in time and it will be painful, especially at a time like this, when she is dealing with caring for someone with cancer. I think his treatment will last around 6 weeks, she doesn't plan on going to all his treatments, I don't know what the plan is there, I don't think she does either, it's kind of a day by day thing. Should I suggest pausing things until the treatment is done and see what where things stand afterwards? I just really don't know what to do or how I feel, but I know I feel sad right now. I don't know if asking this on reddit is the best thing, but I am feeling so unsure about how to deal with this. Thanks.\n",

Whether it's breaking down in my bathroom or a foggy memory of whatever happened after, it occurs per routine. I've tried brutal exposure therapy, I've talked to therapists.

I guess somehow during this experience, he somehow spiraled into not wanting to go out and see Japan unless it was with me. Always in his thoughts, I suppose.

Again we had a big argument for days, he told me he wasn’t too sure about why he done that and that he was just trying to annoy her back then and that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all of that happening I have been feeling insecure for months, we are really open about talking our feelings out, so he knows everything about it and try his best to make me feel pretty and seen by him which I appreciate but recently I feel like that he’s been distant around me because of video games (I know it’s completely different but all of this story before is linked with why I’m not too sure if he just got into a routine or he finds me boring)\n",

      "\n",
      "The thing now is that, whenever he’s at home, he only plays his games, we don’t hang out together as lovely date anymore, or he doesn’t surprise me anymore. Even in the cleaning or cooking at home, I feel like he doesn’t try to put the effort like me into doing it anymore because I always do it. He only stays on his computer for the whole day or sometimes after work he comes back home after 7:30pm, eat, go to sleep for a bit, wake up at 10pm and play his game until 5am and go to work if he’s working the next day or just sleep and do that again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He let me fall asleep alone every night, sometimes I try to stay up until he go to bed but he doesn’t really care even if I ask him to come with me. On the sexual side, if I don’t try to put him in the mood, he doesn’t touch me to lead me into it (we use to make love at least 2/3 times a week now it’s only 1 time a week or every 2 weeks).\n",
      "\n",
      "About the wedding he’s not planning or helping me to plan anything, yesterday my friends came over and tried to help me because they were thinking that I must have been stressing on my own and didn’t wanted to let me down on that. He came back from work, eat the food I cooked for him and went to sleep until 10pm and went on his games. I know he’s providing the money for the wedding but I wish he could support me in all of that as my husband. I tried to tell him last night but he said “I came back from work and fell asleep, when I woke up everything was done how can I help?” And I just chose to stop talking about it and let him play his games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that for him being in a different country is hard and playing his games is a way for him to think of something different and to relax after a day with people speaking a different language but I feel like he’s bored with me too and try to escape all the responsibilities of our relationship. I told him multiples time that I was feeling like he doesn’t care of me as much as he used to do and it was scaring me because I don’t want our relationship to be a routine, I know that he is a homebody person so the past 2 months I made the effort of just doing the things he likes so no more visiting cities around like we used to so he can just chill at home around me but I realised that I am not happy this way and feel extremely guilty for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also about our sexual life, I feel like there is no more excitement for him with me and I started wondering if it was because of my body or maybe I wasn’t taking care of myself enough for him but when I ask him he tells me that I am pretty and he’s lucky to have me. I have been comparing myself more and more and found myself stalking his ex which I never did in my life and it makes me feel pathetic\n",

      "Body text: so me and my angel of a boyfriend connected naturally and have been flourishing all these past months. We have crossed so so many hurdles we never thought we would, lot of bad days, ample of good days but for the past 1.5 month something is just not feeling right. We fight/argue almost everyday, actually 6/7 days in a week goes by arguing which ends up ruining the other one's mood because of which rest of the day goes like a shit and sometimes is carried to the next day as well, though neither of us address this, but we do notice. Its not like the spark has faded away or we don't love each other, I could die for him and I still love him so very much and I know the same goes for him as well. We both really want to be stable and have the peace we both deserve from each other. When he tells me about his other friends being in a relationship where they dont argue and live a peaceful life, I get hella jealous and feel bad that I am not able to make this relationship work now. I have a very vibrant chirpy personality, I talk alot and would instantly light up a dead room. I wanted someone who would make me bath with love every second, who would love me like the air he breathes, which he was but off lately, its not like he doesn't love me, but I would say, he became someone like me, who would show tantrums over stupid issues, who would reply in an offensive way, as if I wasn't enough to be doing that and he should've been the one who would make me calm. But thats not the case, we both have been arguing over stupid things with no one knowing how to amend the shit and we just know how to counter each other. We both keep on asking each other back and forth throughout the day as to  what happened, to no avail.  \n",
      "One thing I would like to add as I consider this a really big factor: Since the beginning of our relationship, he has this friend group of some girls from which I was really insecure of, but with time I understood his relation with them and I am not insecure anymore. But all these months, Ive created so much fuss related to them, so much of drama caused by them, that there exists this knot between us because of external people existing between us. YEAAH, I agree there exists a lot of influence of third parties between us, sometimes I got jealous of him going out with them, I on the other hand hardly hangout with guys. But this issue has been resolved as I no longer seek him to amend a distance from his girlies and ive understood.  \n",

      "Body text: Background: I (40M) am in a relationship for the last 18 months with my gf (30F). I’ve been doing app deliveries for the last few months because we’re struggling financially to make some extra cash after work and on weekends. My gf has prior concerns because I tried to be friends with my x-wife and the gf wanted me to establish additional boundaries. I eventually did and believe she was right. Complicated tale, like all failed marriages, and I don’t want to get into it here. She was right. Even if friendly I was providing too much support in communication. And our boundaries needed to be more stringent, even if just because it made my gf uncomfortable. But she overall has trust issues as well. We are living together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation: I got back from doing deliveries , parked in our and apt parking garage, and wanted additional moment to myself. I put on an ASMR video, popped on my AirPods, leaned back the seat, and dozed off. She called me and the call woke me up because I hadn’t responded to some texts. I was flustered. I knew she wanted to hang out when I got back. We share location. She probably saw me sitting there. And I was planning to leave in a little over an hour to hang out with friends tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lied. I said I was on a call with a guy from work. In truth I had talked to him earlier while delivering, via text on my Apple Play (I swear I was safe doing deliveries). But I recounted briefly that conversation as though I was on the phone with him. I was clearly startled. So probably sounded like I was caught red handed. I felt like I had been. I feel guilty taking time to myself sometimes. It’s a personal thing. Not her. I work on it in therapy. I get embarrassed about listening to ASMR. I don’t know why. I just do.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this led me to lie instinctively. I got back upstairs and she asked to see my phone. Checked. Saw I didn’t call the guy from work. Asked what was up. I instantly came clean. She said she was upset I lied so quickly and so easily. I broke her trust. I suspect she thinks I was hiding something more serious. Or something else. I feel awful. I don’t know what to do. We’ve had other problems in the past. But usually can resolve it. How should I go about handling this situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: my girlfriend caught me lying when I fell asleep in my car taking a moment of zen. She says I broke her trust and is pretty upset. \n",

      "\n",
      "We studied at the same campus, so we spend our time together a lot. In the first few months of our relationship, we meet in the evening after class almost every day to sometimes play sports together, or go out somewhere or just chill and watch movies in the campus. Then every night we’d be on the phone to chitchat until one of us fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But recently he’s been picking up games again. We still spend time together a lot. He’d still invite me to our evening meet-ups, and we still call each other every night. But nowadays every other night when he call me he’d tell me he’s playing games with his friends, but he said it’s okay to stay on call. At first I was being the understanding girlfriend and said it’s okay, but I’ve been falling asleep waiting for him to finish waaay more often now.\n",

      "He sometimes would check if I’m mad at him for playing games more often now. But I’m generally not very good at expressing what I want lol. I’d tell him “i don’t wanna stop you from doing things that you love”. I really mean that, but he has to know when to stop playing. Like, I don’t mind if he play video games more, but can’t he stop around the time I usually fall asleep? This is what I feel inside but I’m embarrassed to ask him this. I don’t wanna interrupt him mid-game and ask him to stop. I want HIM to stop playing because “oh, she’s about to fall asleep so if I don’t stop now, we’d not talk for the whole night”.

I feel like it’d be selfish to ask him not to play his games, but at the same time I really cherish our nighttime chitchat. Plus I can’t really lash out at him for not spending time with me, because he DOES spend his time with me. I just miss our daily nighttime chats. (Oh plus i’m not really good at lashing out hahaha, idk I just feel embarrassed to do it)\n",

But then I’d feel terrible too if he stop playing completely because of me. AGHH WHY AM I SO COMPLICATED??? I’ve never feel so conflicted before. This is my first relationship, why has nobody told me how difficult it is to have feelings for someone????? Like I want him to do what he love but if what he love doesn’t involve me, I’d feel sad. \n",

      "Body text: My wife \\[33F\\] and I \\[35M\\] have 3 kids (ages 1,7,9) and are on a single income in a Low to Medium cost of living city. I work full-time and she's a SAHM. My wife quit her job shortly after our first child was born. She's always insisted on \"separate\" finances so we don't have joint bank accounts, credit cards, etc. She's a 100% beneficiary on all our savings and retirements accounts and we file taxes jointly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After taxes, mortgage, car payments, bills, after school programs, HSA and Roth, we're left with about $3500 per month. I send my wife $1500 for personal use, groceries, and most of the kids' expenses like clothes, snacks, school supplies. Out of the remaining $2000, I send $500 to my elderly parents, and usually spend the rest on miscellaneous expenses, vacations, or large purchases or invest it. I handle all the household finances and bills, and she manages her own CC bills. I've offered to \"combine\" our finances with full transparency, but she prefers the privacy and autonomy as is. Also she's also not very organized with finances, whereas I keep detailed budgets and spreadsheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been our arrangement for several years. It was working well, until recently. She's hinting that she's always short on money and unable to pay her CC bills. She hasn't asked for me to send her more money per month, but she's starting to demand I send her half of any extra money that comes in, like our tax refund ($2000) and my quarterly bonus ($5000). She also pressured me into giving sister a large wedding gift. I told her I'll gladly contribute, but not all of it. I asked her if she had any savings and she got upset and called me stingy. We do have money tied up in investments and crypto, but I would rather not sell unless we absolutely have to.\n",

      "I love her to death and as a SAHM she's amazing and I appreciate her sacrifices and constant attention to the kids.

How should we improve our financial relationship and ease some of the tension?\n",

      "Body text: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. At the beginning of our relationship she moved in early due to problems with her roommates. After moving in she rarely helped with house work. At the beginning this was excused due to her working more. However, when the roles swapped and I started working more than her, her workload around the house didn't change. Now she works around 18 hours a week plus university and I work 28 hours a week plus university. She might help out around the house 1 day of the week but she doesn't cook so if I don't feel like cooking, we waste money on takeout. She doesn't do the dishes because the water is yucky and doesn't take the bin out because it smells. She only does the washing when she runs out of clothes but I run out of clothes before her so I am constantly doing it. She leaves her clothes out on the floor as well as her makeup. She has a car but doesn't drive so if she wants to go somewhere I end up getting dragged along and because she doesn't drive I am the one constantly doing the shopping. Around once every two weeks she makes a comment about feeling bad about how she isn't helping out around the house and she will start helping but she never does. On top of this, when we moved house, I packed up 90% of the house. Moved it all except for the large items which I needed help to carry. I unpacked 90% of it. We needed to get a new lounge so I was tasked with it because no one responds to her on market place and when I hadn't she would constantly get upset at me but not do anything about it herself. When we have to contact the real estate it is my job to do so because my name is first on the lease but at the previous property where her name was first, it was still my job. \n",

      "One her closest friends was her ex-boyfriend who told me before we got together that he was still in love with her and would do what ever it took to get her back. When i talked to her about him she said he was just a friend and didn't want to cut him off even after he admitted he still had feelings for her whilst we were dating. After about six months of being together and me making my wishes about him know, she finally stopped talking to him. Since moving from our home town she has not made an effort to meet up with friends who live near us as well as the new friends she has made since moving here, whilst saying how she has no friends here and is lonely sitting at home all day. Her out of town friends that come to visit us are constantly making jokes at the expense of me and my family and I have made it know that i don't want to be around these people but she wants me to come to her friends events because they are her friends and they need to like me. On top of these friends, her family is also making jokes at the expense of me but according to her its just how the show there love. Recently we have been making visits to she her family and due to the distance, I have put in time off for a day each week because I have to drive. So ill drive her the 3 hours each way for a day trip, or drop her off and let her spend the night and then after an 8 hour shift drive the 3 hours each way to pick her up. \n",

      "A ongoing issue in out relationship has been our intimacy. At the beginning we would be intimate once a day or more but as time went on I gradually pulled back, initially it was because I couldn't keep up. When she told be this, she said i should go on testosterone or get a pill. Now we are intimate 1-2 times a week because I am very conscious about the fact that I'm not ready to be a father and she would keep the child if she got pregnant. I would be comfortable with eliminating sex but she isn't so I cut back. I have told her my reasoning and she is always saying she is on birth control and she needs more. Due to this she has been very pushy about this topic and is guilting me into it by saying i am not fulfilling her needs so we are having intimacy even when I don't want it.\n",

We haven't been back in a few months so my GF hasn't been able to meet up with her friends and family that live there. She yelled at me because I didn't put this time off and went on to say that my mother is going to get mad at her because they talk more than I talk to my mother. It has to be noted that I don't particular like my mother as she tried to paint my father as the bad guy after their divorce and has cause my sister and father not to be on speaking turns. My father on the other hand has never said anything bad about my mother and even stops us from saying anything bad about her.

      "Body text: **TL;DR; : I need to know if this relationship is worth saving given this scenario. ** \n",
      "\n",
      "Last night (Saturday) my GF told me she was going for drinks with a couple friends from work. I was in bed on her IPad watching Ytube when a notification came through from one of the guys she was meeting. It read as ‘No one Knows’ - my heart rate skyrockets. I pressed the notification and it went to their messages, shortly after that I discovered that they’ve been making sex jokes and straight up flirting with each other saying why don’t you come here to my sheets so we can sort out ur behaviour etc. He was 100% laying it on more than her in the texts but she was continuing the convo and letting it happen in sexual ways. Then I found that he asked her to meet tonight, he wanted to know what me and her got up to last night. (we had a 3som with our best F friend, it was probably the best night of my life but that’s besides the point) - he wanted her to repeat everything and I guess she was into that so she went to meet him. So at this point I’ve just discovered they’ve been basically sexting, she’s lied about who she’s with, and now the ‘no one knows’ comment leaves me inevitably thinking something happened when they were out. Don’t think I’ve ever felt as helpless knowing this was actively happening and I’m just watching over in a void. Then seconds later BOOM, the chat was deleted, she was actively hiding it whilst I was on her instagram. I caught it at the perfect time I guess. I took pictures on my phone for proof beforehand anyways.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got the train back to the car park and drove home so she was somewhat sober. This wasn’t a drunk mistake it was premeditated, it was a choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part that’s fucking me up the most is that this guy is someone who me and my girlfriend basically celebrated when she came in contact with him. He’s someone who’s started giving her freelance work when she’s been trying to get into the industry for YEARS. She’s been in absolute rock bottom for a while, I stuck through it with her and we were finally getting somewhere. He’s her mentor within her new agency, that’s what hurts the most, that same person who’s given her so much has taken so much from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 7 years 1 kiss could be forgivable for me, but this is different; the last time things started picking up for her in the industry she went away for a couple weeks and when she got back she broke down and told me she exchanged nudes to someone she was working with. I gave her a chance and so on because she owned up to it and truly regretted her actions. But here we are, similar scenario, within work. This is her career, I can’t control that, how can I set boundaries on something she has to go to, and these people she has to meet. Her mentor she has to work with. How can I enjoy my day knowing every guy she meets is basically on the sideline waiting for her to slip-up. And this guy recently took his chance and he won.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is the love of my life, my best friend. We grew up together. I cannot physically imagine life without her. We lasted the whole of uni and years after, lived together during lock-down, all of my friends are her friends and vice versa, we’ve seen so many relationships fall in our time. We’ve always been strong. I cannot believe this is real.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confronted her about it this morning, I was so upset from practically having a panic attack the night before I was too exhausted to even raise my voice. I was just in shock I guess. She didn’t try to defend herself, she didn’t try to downplay it she immediately broke down and you know how it goes. She admitted to kissing him. She was truly apologetic and distraught but in my head it’s only this way because I found out. We would be walking the dogs or visiting my family today if I wasn’t on your Ipad last night.\n",

      "I left the house, went to the golf course, hit 2 balls then basically just gave my basket to the next stall I just couldn’t. I thought it would clear my mind.\n",

      "I came back and told her to come outside and we went for a walk, I said everything I wanted to say, we cried for hours. I shouldn’t have comforted her but I just couldn’t help it. We ended up laying there sobbing. It’s almost as if she knows that’s it. I said I need to go home, I need time, and I’m not making any promises. I don’t think I can live like this, I’m completely broken and I can’t believe you’ve put us into this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is when she said “I can’t live without you, I care more about you than life itself, when you were at the golf course I thought about killing myself.” What do I even do with that information, my whole body literally went limp there and then it was like I fainted without loosing consciousness, exhausted and that was the blow to the head. Now I feel disrupted in my feelings as if to say my decision in the next couple days means life or death to her essentially. I know she wouldn’t, but the pure weight of that thought was enough for me to now have major stress about this whole situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m feeling a million emotions, I can say for myself i truly am a caring and kind guy, I make her laugh so much, we’re always having fun and doing things together. We were so happy, we were in such a good place before this, on the rise, truly loving. She couldn’t even say why she did it, she said she lost control, she enjoyed being flattered and it went too far, I’m her first relationship so she hasn’t had the life experience to learn and develop from mistakes or whatever. But i don’t think that’s enough for me to learn to trust her again, for the second time. We are literally soul mates, I planned to be buried next to her, I was months away from asking her to marry me. I feel like I’ve jumped into an alternate reality after somehow taking wrong turn at a checkpoint. As much as I want this to work out, I really truly do, but I don’t think she’s left me any choice. I’d love to know if anyone thinks there’s something worth saving here because if there is I absolutely need to consider every outcome. She is truly sorry she’s just spent the last hour led next to me sobbing saying please, if I have to let you go it will stay with me for the rest of my life. This wasn’t supposed to happen but it’s the reality she’s put us into. And now we’re essentially waiting for me to make a decision.\n",

      "Body text: I, 15M want to breakup with my 15F girlfriend of 1 year. She's not my type, unintelligent, and immature. She lacks common sense. All of it. She can't do much without me and it's getting annoying. I met her in school last year around February. We had a talking stage for awhile until she confessed her love for me sometime after march. I chose to develop feelings for her and we ended up dating in June. I'm just now realizing I started to date her out of pity of her liking me. This is the third time I've done this to myself. This is also my longest lasting relationship. I recently got taken out of school due to my medical disabilities. I got sick everyday and I got hospitalized three times in the last year and a half due to medical exacerbations (CF). I'm now in online school which is really easy but I'm starting to lose my sanity. I've thought about breaking up with her about 5 or 6 times throughout our relationship. I don't just mean one thought that I should, I spent days and weeks thinking about it, but it keeps coming back. I not only want to go back to in person highschool, but I also want to deepen my relationship with this one girl, we'll call her B. B has an obvious crush on me with physical flirting and always looking at me during class and whatnot. She is 15F and exactly my type. Absolutely my type. She's funny, very very smart, acts very mature, and is absolutely gorgeous. She's shorter and prettier in my opinion, which I like in a girl. However, as I'm not in school, I have no way to deepen my relationship with her, or contact her. I don't want to hurt my girlfriend as she's insanely innocent and I don't know what I'd do if I hurt her, but if I breakup with her, I will hurt her. Our 1 year is coming up, and her birthday's 2 days after. I have no clue what to do, and I'm losing sleep over it. \n",

He lied to me and that’s not okay but now I don’t know how to feel the age gap isn’t any different  but the school year is. I’ve always been told that if the years don’t touch neither should you. I really like him and don’t know what to do in this situation as I don’t want to be labelled as a cradle snatcher, is it okay for me to date him in the future or should I give up on it as I’m now worried about the difference in maturity between us.Am I reading too much into this or Is it okay as the age difference is still a year and 4 months ?\n",

Since we started dating I have told him multiple times that I do not want to kiss when we are around a large group of people or people I respect (ex: teachers, parents). Still, he ignores that boundary and then gets angry at me for \"not showing him affection\" when I do not kiss him. I have tried to talk to him about this and how it hurts me that he ignores my boundaries especially a small one, but he says stuff like \"It doesn't matter because people won't remember\" or \"I know you are uncomfortable with it hun but its not that much\" and I feel disrespected. I offered solutions like creating a small gesture that we can do in places that are crowded, but shutting it down saying that we should just kiss even though I'm uncomfortable. I don't want to break things off but I don't think I could be with someone who deliberately chooses to disregard my boundaries. How should I handle this?\n",

After finishing work around midnight, we drove home, and that's when my family started calling me non-stop. They accused me of lying and seeing my girlfriend behind their backs.

The whole thing got me even more anxious, and I deeply regret not protecting her properly.\n",

      "Body text: Long story short. We’ve been together a year and have had multiple bumps in our sex life. The first month was great multiple times a day. Then he stopped initiating sex. I had to ask for sex and he wouldn’t engage with penetration or cum himself. We had a talk and it became more frequent but now he struggles with ED issues, being unable to cum or taking a long time. And I was finding socks with cum around the house. We had another discussion where I said this needed to be addressed. That I didn’t understand why he’s masturbating but can’t cum with me. He got upset but eventually “acknowledged” it. I told him it may be an over masturbation issue causing him to be desensitized he says he doesn’t have a porn problem. I said maybe take a break on the masturbation piece trying to work with him using I statements etc. Then yesterday he got in the shower and I had an odd feeling he jokingly told me to go upstairs. I said okay and acted like I did. But I came back around and I could hear him in the bathroom not porn but him making sounds. Then he came out and had a boner was breathing heavy. I kissed him and asked what’s up then he wanted to have sex. It took him 45 minutes to cum, I said if he wanted along time it’s okay. He laughed again and said he didn’t. I want to ask him if he masturbated before our sex so I know it’s not a me issue. but I feel like I’ve also over done these conversations. but I want it to stop bouncing around in my head cause I feel like he was lying.\n",

      "Body text: hi i just needed some advice because i 21F find myself really stuggling with this. i've been with my boyfriend 22M for a year. a few months into our relationship he came clean about having a daughter with a girl he had a one night stand with a few years ago. he was really upset about telling me because he really cares about me and was worried that him coming clean would make me not want to be with him. i assured him that i still want to be with him and tried to show an interest in her. we never talked about it seriously since then and everytime i'm reminded of the fact he's a father my stomach becomes a knot. only my mom knows in my family because i know they would see him differently and probably judge him for it. im still so young, we both are, and at the time he came clean about it i never thought it through how difficult it actually would be for me. i just accepted him immediately and then when i was alone it hit me at once. i think the fact that we're so young makes this so much harder. im not prepared to be a stepmom if we get married, and the idea that he had a child through a one night stand really bothers me. i hate hookup culture, so the fact that he had that lifestyle before me is bothersome. i dont want to be judgemental, but the thought of it just makes me so uncomfortable. he rarely involves me with her. he rarely even brings her up to me, except to send me a picture or to tell me he can't see me because he's spending time with her. he sees her most weekends, but it's inconsistent. ive never seen or met the mom. i never told him it bothers me because i dont want to offend him at all. and i dont even know how to tell him or where to start because as far as he knows, i'm okay with the whole situation. i wish i was more accepting but i just feel so sad every time im reminded of it. i do love him but i'm really struggling on how to cope with this. i thought if more time passed i would accept it, but i still find myself getting upset over it. she's only a toddler right now but im scared for when she gets older.

      "Hii! Ok, so let me set the stage. I (18F) met this girl named Emma (18F) online back in October and after 3 days I fell in love with her. She felt the same and we talked about meeting. I had never been in a real relationship before but I knew she is the one for me. I also did not realize that I liked girls until I saw her because I only liked men previously. \n",

      "Body text: For context, we are both in our junior year of HS and have been dating for around 3 months now. Sometimes when we talk about our future, it seems she has her life/career completely laid out for the next 10 years, planning to work in an extremely high paying job.

It gives me value and makes me happy because I made her happy, so not being the one to do that crushes me. I also don't have any other redeeming qualities. I can't seem to stop myself from overthinking about it because I don't even know what I'm feeling, and it clouds my mind every day. Am I thinking too far ahead? What am I supposed to tell her? Why can't I just be happy for her?? I'm aware that I have no control over what she wants to do or how much money she'll make and she's not even doing anything wrong but every time I talk to her that's all I think about now. I really like her and everything else is perfectly fine, so I would rather not break things off cause of my childish fears.\n",

We have a decent balance in terms of finances and she definitely pulls her own weight in contributing to the monthly payment and making sure there's always food at home. She always makes sure there's dinner at the end of the day and really goes out of her way to make sure we have healthy meals throughout the day.

I had a talk with her in the car and she said she was really bothered by it and is trying her best to better herself but just struggles. I asked what long term goals she had and she couldn't really bring one up besides starting a family one day and continuing to support me.

      "Title: my partner had a rebound during our split and it's making me question my self-respect and the relationship\n",
      "Body text: My partner (F25) of 2 years and I (F24) broke up for about 5 months in September 2024 due to very poor mental health on my part (I had 0 sex drive, was always depressed, distant and lacked communication). During the 5 months of no-contact that followed I got into therapy, started going to the gym, switched schools and made new friends. I didn't think we would get back together, but I realised I really needed to work on myself and decided to wait 2 months before attempting to date/go out with other people again. Around January 2025 I had my first and only one-night stand and went home crying because sleeping with someone else made me realise how much I missed my ex. I waited another month and finally decided to break no-contact. My ex answered instantly and we agreed to meet and catch up. The coffee date we had planned turned into a sleepover and we soon decided to give our relationship a second chance. After a couple of weeks of perfect dates, long conversations, beautiful days spent together, we had the difficult \"did you see other people while we were broken up\" conversation. My (now) partner admitted she had downloaded a dating app the day after our breakup and started going out with this one girl 2 weeks later. They dated for 4 months but never made it official because they were too incompatible. The girl she dated had unreciprocated feelings for my partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I learned this I spent a whole night crying. I felt so replaceable and unworthy of love. Knowing my (then) ex was able to move on (even if not fully) THAT fast while I honoured what we had and actually put in the work to become a better human made me feel SO lost. I talked to her about it and she reminded me single people can act as they please, and also said that she desperately needed a confidence boost after being turned down for months while we were together in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to put this behind me because I was reassured by my partner about the importance I hold in her life now. She is incredibly sweet, caring, generous and kind to me. Fast forward two months, I am beginning to feel like I lacked self-respect by getting back together with her. Though she is an AMAZING partner, I am ridden by insecurities and fears. I get triggered by songs, movie-plots, videos online etc... I often wonder if a person who actually respects themselves would ever get back with someone who moved on so fast after a breakup. I don't know how to go about these thoughts I have.

It’s like we're stuck between closeness and this unresolved pain. We are both doing individual therapy which was her condition to figure out whether we are still together due to codependence or something else that's not genuine, both of our therapists have concluded we don't have any behaviors within the relationship itself indicating our drive to be together is due to unhealthy patterns or traits like obsessions.\n",

My girlfriend’s a little on the bigger side and weighs I think 130 (?) if I listened to her usually ranting correctly, and is really insecure about it. She’s had an eating disorder for a while and also experiences body dysmorphia, which is not something I was aware of since she’d never mentioned it to me and I only became aware when she started crying on a call one random day and didn’t talk to me for a little bit. My point is that she is struggling heavily and I don’t know how to help her because I’ve always been on the thinner side and have never had to worry about the things she does when eating, and we’re also long distance so I can’t comfort her the way I usually would if we’re together, and I wanted to try and come to Reddit to see if anyone had advice on things I could do or gift her that would help or at least comfort her when she’s feeling down about herself or just in general since we don’t see each other often and I don’t know what could comfort her since I’ve never had to deal with this kind of stuff and aren’t well with my words :(\n",

      "Body text: Hello Reddit!\n",
      "\n",
      "So I am in a bit of a self-dug hole right now. I believe I have already met my soulmate. We have already dated twice in the past. We were each others’ first loves and we even tried dating again after college. Unfortunately, when we got back together the second time(26yo), we were both going through huge personal growth periods and were not good for each other. We were both in bad places and I think we reached for each other out of comfort and weren’t mature enough to realize it at the time. We dated another two years and it didn’t work out because we didn’t know how to communicate and work through our issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "For transparency, our issue was that I (male) didn’t always ejaculate during sex. This caused her to degrade her own self esteem. Despite attempts to reassure her that she did nothing wrong and that I I still really enjoyed sex, it kept getting brought up. This caused me to have anxiety about sex and eventually got to where I avoided it. That made things worse and it became a big enough issue to where we broke up. It was my call. Like I said before, I was under a lot of stress outside of the relationship. I didn’t know what to do at the time, so I just cut it off. We dated for a total of 5 years. I was the one that hurt her in the end because I felt like I wasn’t being heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast-forward to now. We have both had long term relationships since. I have never felt love like I did with her — speaking for how I have felt with my partners. I still feel as though she was my one. I dream about her. We communicate through our Instagram stories (or I’m having schizophrenic symptoms resulting from these unresolved feelings; but we have done this before. I would say let’s assume I’m right but I want to hear why I may be wrong) and still share all of the same interests. She stays in touch with my mom. She watches ALL of my stories, but never interacts. I write to her like I used to very infrequently, but never send the messages. I act like she died even though she hasn’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "The kicker: She has been in a relationship for almost 5 years at this point. No marriage, no children. She doesn’t post them, ever really. Which is uncharacteristic, but I’m speaking about I person I knew 7 years ago. People can change. (I am prepared to find out the person I still think about is also completely gone). Regardless, despite whatever signs I think I might be perceiving, I don’t want to mess anything up for her that might be good. At the end of the day, her happiness means more to me than my own. So I haven’t reached out. In addition, I have considered all the bridges that were burned by the second break up. Like they gave me a second chance, and she ended up hurt again. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem: For the reasons mentioned above, I want to. Multiple long term relationships on my end, before and after and it still feels like she’s the one. We tried again when we should have been wise enough to know it was a bad time for us both. I know it would have worked out had we had the tools and wisdom that comes with a little more time on this world. I know personally I have done a lot of personal growth. I’ve been in therapy for a couple years and settled into a career (I had no financial security before). As has she, my mom went to her college graduation. We aren’t living with our parents anymore — point is to say the outside stressors on our lives are completely different now than they were back then. \n",

He offered to do so, and I always assumed it was okay, but clearly, it’s become a source of resentment for him. I fully understand how giving me rides could feel burdensome. It’s time-consuming and inconvenient, and he’s under no obligation to do it. If this was his way of setting a boundary, I would have respected that. But instead, it came out in a way that felt more like shaming than communicating a need.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a Wednesday when we were both off work, he picked me up so we could go work out together. We’d been texting throughout the day, and everything seemed fine. But when he picked me up, he was clearly upset. When I asked what was wrong, he started bringing up how I needed to get my life together. He began by saying he was tired of giving me rides and wished I could just drive myself. I completely get that frustration, and I was ready to have a calm conversation about it. But then he started getting more heated, saying things like how I’m lazy and how he’s tired of being my “taxi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he shifted to criticizing my living situation, saying it was pathetic that I was still living with my parents and that I needed to “grow up.” This part was confusing because my housing situation doesn’t directly affect him. He’s explicitly told me he doesn’t want to live together, so it felt unnecessary and unfair to attack me for something that isn’t even his concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I tried to explain that I was aware of these issues and actively working on them, but he wasn’t listening. I asked him to calm down because it was starting to feel less like a conversation and more like an attack. That only seemed to make him angrier. He began yelling over me, interrupting me every time I tried to speak, and eventually told me that I was a burden and that he wasn’t happy with me. He said he didn’t want to be with me and that he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. It was a complete escalation from where the conversation had started, and I was left feeling blindsided and hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t speak for a few days, and during that time, I was left feeling completely confused and rejected. On Saturday, he asked me to come over, and I thought we’d have a proper conversation about what happened. Instead, as soon as I walked in, he started crying, hugging me, and trying to initiate sex. I told him I wasn’t ready to be intimate until we talked things through, but since there were other people around, we agreed to wait until the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, we went to a museum and finally talked. He said he felt overwhelmed by how much he thinks I rely on him and that he felt like he was carrying the weight of my responsibilities. I can understand feeling that way regarding the car situation. It’s a lot to always be the one driving and adjusting his schedule to accommodate me, and that’s valid. But he also made it sound like my entire existence was weighing him down, which felt like he was placing blame on me for things I can’t immediately fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel like I treat him as a father figure or that I rely on him more than a typical partner would. But the way he expressed it made me feel like he sees me as a dependent child rather than an equal. I’ve taken steps to address what he brought up, but I’m still struggling with how he communicated it, how quickly things escalated, and how extreme his reactions were. I don’t know how to navigate his expectations without feeling invalidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend and I had a major argument that almost ended our relationship. It started when he told me he felt overwhelmed and said I was a burden to him. He brought up feeling frustrated about giving me rides since I don’t have a car yet and criticized me for still living with my parents, even though he’s the one who offered to drive me and my living situation doesn’t directly affect him. The conversation escalated quickly he started yelling, calling me names, and said he wasn’t happy or attracted to me anymore. We didn’t talk for a few days, then he asked me to come over, immediately got emotional, and tried to initiate sex before we’d even talked things through. The next day, we finally discussed it, and he said he felt like I relied on him too much, almost like a child. I understand how the car situation could feel burdensome, but I feel like he took it way too far and expressed himself in a really hurtful way. Now, I’m trying to figure out how to address his concerns without feeling invalidated or belittled.\n",

      "Hi, \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm currently facing a very difficult time as my BF (32M ) of 5 years cheated on me (F26) and i found out about it back in 2022. He apologized and accepted his mistake and begged me to stay even though I told him that it would be impossible for me to trust him again but he asked for another chance and said I will make you trust me again i will change myself you will see. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I did give him that chance but ever since I have developed extremely anxious attachment style meanwhile he is an avoidant. Now the thing is that all these past years, he did try his best to make me feel reassured but somehow it is never enough for me. I'm hung up at the thought of being left for another woman again. And in that fear, i have been holding onto him so tightly that i think i might have suffocated him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since he is an avoidant, he needs space when we have a fight or he feels overwhelmed by my extreme emotions. meanwhile i always want to resolve the fight then and there and as quick as possible and i often violate his boundary ( which i know now is so wrong and I'm ashamed and willing to change ) but in the heat of the moment, when he asks for space, my anxiousness translates it as him abandoning me in the time of need. i feel like he is leaving me. and I start to take it personally although it has nothing to do with me, but its just his way of self regulating. I havent developed any healthy outlet or way to self regulate myself. Im working on it now. I do become better for sometime but whenever the feeling of him being slightly distant starts to creep in, my mind goes straight to the what ifs. what if he is giving time to someone else thats why he is being unavailable and distant to me? what if he is talking to another girl? what if he leaves me for someone else? all these questions then lead me to ask him all sorts of questions and i make him swear that he is not lying. I realize now how hard it must be for him to deal with all this given his attachment style. he withdraws. I push him. the argument get bigger and worst. He flips that why cant you give me space when I need it. Then I beg him to come back, we talk things out and then the same painful cycle repeats. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "will this stop if i stop chasing him and start trusting him? is it possible? i really love him and don't want him to hate me. i don't want to give up on the relationship but i also don't want to smother him. if it is something that seems impossible then I'd have to let him go because i cant keep hurting him. \n",

      "Title: I (30M) am struggling to respect or admire my girlfriend (29F) after learning more about her lifestyle and past — is this incompatibility or me being too rigid?\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been seeing my girlfriend for about six months. At first, I was really drawn to her energy — she’s warm, open, emotionally expressive, and genuinely kind-hearted. She was incredibly accepting of my past and showed me a level of patience and nonjudgment that I deeply respected. I wanted to build something meaningful together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But over time, I started to feel a quiet internal tension that kept growing. About three months in, she opened up about parts of her past she had initially lied about — her drug use, her drinking habits, the lifestyle she lived up until shortly before we met. It wasn’t just experimentation in her early twenties — it was part of her recent life. And while she told me she’d stopped since being with me, I couldn’t stop feeling conflicted about it. What also bothered me was how she often spoke about being drunk or high in a lighthearted, almost glorified way — like telling funny stories about blacking out or doing cocaine. It made it seem like these weren’t just mistakes she learned from, but part of a lifestyle she still identified with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also struggled to find things I genuinely admire about her in terms of growth or achievement. She doesn’t seem driven or motivated, doesn’t work hard, doesn’t cook, and is often late. She values “fun” but not the work or structure that makes it sustainable. When we talk, most of her stories revolve around partying or being high. I don’t think I’ve ever heard her talk about a goal or project she’s working toward.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often drinks with the explicit intention of getting drunk, and she’s blacked out more times than I’m comfortable with. She’s gotten hurt, made poor choices, and still tells those stories with pride or amusement. We recently went to a party together, and being around that scene with her and her friends—the drugs, the partying—it just pushed me over the edge emotionally. I left feeling like I didn’t even like who she was anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I value discipline, structure, accountability, and growth. I’ve worked hard to become someone I can respect — and I’m looking for a partner whose values and lifestyle align with that. I know no one is perfect (including me), and I don’t expect anyone to come without a past. But what I’ve realized is that it’s not just the past itself that bothers me — it’s how close it still feels to the present, and how much I still see it shaping her identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her as a person, or whether I was initially more in love with the idea of her — the version she presented early on, before these truths came to light. The more I sat with it, the more it felt like I was mentally and emotionally carrying a mismatch — trying to bridge the gap between my values and hers, between what I hope for in a long-term partner and what I’m actually experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe people can and do change. But I’ve also learned that for me, admiration and shared principles are foundational. When those start to erode, so does my emotional connection. And I’ve started to wonder if I’m trying to force compatibility where it just doesn’t exist. Since then, I’ve been struggling internally. I’ve found myself questioning whether I truly admire her, or whether I’m just clinging to the hope that she’ll eventually become the person I thought she was. I’ve started feeling emotionally disconnected, and even a bit resentful. I also wonder whether I’m being too rigid or idealistic but I can’t shake the discomfort. Should I break it off if I don’t feel that I can respect her?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I’ve been dating someone who initially lied about their past with drug use. Her past (and recent) choices around drugs and partying conflict with who I thought she was and drug use was a dealbreaker for me. I’m torn between wanting to be accepting, and feeling like I’m losing respect and admiration in the process. Unsure if I’m being too rigid, or if this is just an honest incompatibility.\n",

      "Title: My girlfriend is upset that I speak to/am friends with an ex\n",
      "Body text: So I, 17(transM), have been dating my gf, 17(f) for over a year, we’re seniors in high school, and just recently i began talking to my ex, 18(nb) again as they were in a few of my classes. We dated in 8th grade, so we were 13, and we haven’t talked since then. They have a new partner whom they constantly talk about and I love my girlfriend so much, I’m always telling her that. I was happy that me and NB could be friends again, although I was wary at first because of how weird our middle school relationship was, but they’ve changed for the better and so I have I. Anyways, my gf said that it made her uncomfortable that I was talking with them, so I stopped for a while, but I’m friends with another one of their friends, A, (17M). A takes me home from school occasionally as I can’t drive, and sometimes NB is in the car with us. I noticed my gf acting off about this so I started taking the bus home again to ease her mind. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable, but I genuinely like being friends with NB, and its hard to avoid them when I’m friends with A as well. I have no romantic or sexual interest in NB at all, I just enjoy being able to be friends again. I thought it wouldnt be a problem since it’s been over 4 years and both of us are in stable, commited relationships now, but my gf doesn’t seem to think so. Is there anyway I can ease my girlfriends mind while still being friends with NB? Or do I just have to cut our friendship off again? I care about my gf more than I care about NB, but I do like being friends again. \n",

      "Body text: Hi all. When my girlfriend and I first started dating a few years back, we didn't want kids. Over time, I grew to be unsure if I wanted kids. She kept saying stuff like \"maybe we can have 1 kid,\" whenever she saw a cute kid in life or in social media or something (this was not prompted by me). It made me happy because while I was unsure if I wanted kids or not, it was nice to know she was on the same page of being open to a kid.

On my end, I also value my personal freedom and spontaneity. I love having my hobbies and free time. I also am changing careers and will need another 3-4 years at least before I feel financially stable enough to have a kid. I feel this urge to feel the connection with a child that I always hear about, where I get to build this community of a family and get to raise a whole ass human being to be whoever they want to be. I don't even care if it's my biological kid, I'd be cool with adopting or fostering.

      "Body text: So for context, I wrote on this sub awhile back but just ended up deleting the post altogether. I was in a two year relationship with my last gf, and it ended in about the middle of March. I was completely devastated, and it ended primarily due to my abuse of alcohol and how it affected our relationship. For context, I would drink severely for the sole reason it made me last longer in bed. Again, a horrible idea. My ex and I during our tenure would have sex almost every single day, and the alcohol abuse came more or less towards the end of the relationship, say in the last 6 months or so. Once the relationship ended, I was completely devastated and had absolutely no idea as to why it was over. For the time being after the relationship ended, I would continue drinking, and id spiral out and constantly berate my ex and do everything I could to get her back. We would occasionally meet up, although she’d be extremely pissed at me and that was essentially how it went for awhile. \n",
      "\n",
      "On March 29, I met a girl, who was literally everything my family wouldve ever wanted, myself included. We were both Jewish, which my ex was not, and I personally don’t date based off of religion or nationality, but the fact that she was foreign and Jewish was a massive plus. We were supposed to meet twice, however both plans got cancelled due to fears that I was some sort of horrible human being, and eventually I was able to meet her and her parents. We all went out to dinner, and I was loved by her parents at first sight. I was kind, I was respectful, and I was confident. I brought large bouquets for not only her but her mom as well. At the end of that night, her parents allowed me to take her to my aunts birthday party, to which everybody from my side met her. Everybody was obsessed. For context, my family completely despised my ex because of the fact that she was not mentally sane and had many underlying health issues. Ironically my exes father knew my family from before I was even born. For even MORE context, one of the Rabbi’s I go to, who did my Bar Mitzvah, is best friends for over 35 years with this new girls family. So great, double whammy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here’s where things started to go to the wrong. When I started seeing the new girl, I was still in contact with my ex, because I was not ready to move onto a new relationship, which everybody around me told me was a wife. I believe them. Me and this new girl would spend several days of the week together, and we started dating this last Sunday. Yes, that early. This new girl quite literally completely cleaned out my entire room, redid it, constantly cleaned dishes, brought cakes when she would come over, everything. I mean I could not have had a better girl walk into my life. However, I had lied to this new girl about me being completely over my ex, essentially downplaying it as no big deal. I expect no sympathy for what I’ve done, but in essence to just have my story heard. I mean this new girl was also drop dead gorgeous. No question about it. It was literally heaven on Earth. Just yesterday, one of my friends ended up inviting my ex to my house unannounced, and I eventually got a phone call from my ex saying she was outside. I walked out, and there she was. Keep in mind I had just started a relationship with this new girl. I allowed my ex to come inside to talk about whatever she needed to talk about, more or less because I always cared about her regardless of the hell I was put through. We sat in the living room, directly across from each other on opposite sides of the couch, and we talked for a good hour until my ex broke down telling me how everybody just wants to use her for her body and so on. Now, to spare the details, all that ended was with us sleeping together. Immediately afterwards, I felt like the world’s biggest monster. This new girl did everything she could to make a positive impression and because my attachment issues to the horrible past, I ended up cheating. \n",
      "\n",
      "What followed was this: my ex ended up telling the new girl because I had lied to my ex saying that I wasnt in a relationship even though I was. I ended up telling the new girl as well, and it went about as well as you think. It didn’t help to note that I had prom with the new girl in about a week, and the new girl made me text her dad about what had happened. To which I did. I wrote a long paragraph explaining my sheer stupidity and that I was the world’s biggest fool in doing what I did. I had spoken to the new girl about twice over the phone, piecing out what had happened, and I had owned up to my mistake and held accountability. I didn’t want to continue lying to her. You know, the saying always goes that once you’ll never know what you lost until it’s gone. The new girl also told the same friend who ironically invited my ex to my house without my knowledge, that the only way she’d consider talking to me is if my grandfather would talk to her. What she quite literally said was, “because i actually really respect that man and if he thinks something is right then maybe i'll listen to him… like if he really wants me then i guess he won't have a problem telling his entire family what he did”. \n",
      "\n",
      "So now I am where i am at. I haven’t spoken to my ex at all, or to anyone for that matter. I really want to pursue a long-term future with this new girl but I got thrown back into a moment of vulnerability and abuse of my kindness. What should I do? Should I let the new girl go? Or should I own up to everybody, make myself a fool, and hope that my accountability and actions speak louder than my words. For a little more context, the new girls last relationship ended due to cheating, and my grandparents absolutely despise my ex with a cold-hearted passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;dr\n",
      "\n",
      "I cheated on my brand new, perfect girlfriend with my ex of two years out of pure attachment and abuse of my kindness. Things were absolutely perfect between my new girlfriend and I, I owned up to it, and I even sent her father (as requested by the new girl) a paragraph dictating everything that had happened. Now my new girlfriend (well, not anymore at the time of writing this), said that she would only consider talking if I owned up to my entire family who hates my ex with a passion about what I did. \n",

      "Body text: my boyfriend is an amazing guy at heart. very kind, caring, and just golden retriever vibes. however, this is his first adult relationship and i’m having the hardest time having to re teach everything. i know he means well, but we’ve had a couple differences in the year i’ve been seeing him. i’ll summarize them below \n",
      "\n",
      "1. he’s learning communication so i’ve had to teach him what’s appropriate and what’s not. for example, he used to just drive home from college and not tell me (we’re medium distance) and i wouldn’t know bc he wouldn’t answer his phone for a day at time\n",
      "2. he has a lot of girl friends. when i say a lot, i mean majority of his friends are girls. which i have 0 problem with because i know he’s loyal, but i’ve had to tell him he’s crossed some very normal and obvious boundaries. having to teach him this was tough\n",
      "3. he’s still in college and has 0 money. i know he’s young and we’re all figuring our lives out, so i’ve been lenient. but i am so beyond different & in a very diff position. i grew up broke for most of my life, and come from a family/cultural background where we hustle really hard. i’ve been working since i was 13 and have paid for a a lot of my own stuff since leaving for college. i worked my ass off to get a scholarship, and left college debt free & having worked maybe 10+ jobs throughout my life at the age of 22. i got an amazing job at a highly accredited bank because i worked my ass off for it, and have 2 side hustles to have extra income for fun. him however, he’s only getting his shit together now bc i’m pushing him to better himself. he just got his first part time job ever, is graduating over a year late (at 24 almost 25), has no internship experience, etc. it’s just been hard having to push someone to do stuff they should be internally motivated to do\n",
      "4. he never plans or communicates his schedule for when he comes to visit or i do. so basically half of the very little amount of time we have together is spent with him being busy doing hw or having work bc he didn’t plan well enough \n",
      "5. i had surgery and it was life threatening and he didn’t come to visit or even offer\n",

      "\n",
      "there’s some small other issues but everything he did wrong i communicated and he fixed the issue. he’s so good with that, and im aware everyone matures at a diff rate. my dilemma is i just feel like we’re at different stages in our life. i don’t know if it’s fair to myself to play build a boyfriend, but on the other hand he’s such a kind soul and im afraid i may not find someone as nice or someone else will snatch him up. you can teach things, but u can’t teach kindness. anyways, im very mature for my age and had to grow up very very young due to family circumstances. i’m afraid of pushing him too hard or him not feeling good enough and in turn resenting me. i care about my partners and will always push them to be the best version of themselves (nicely of course lol). also some more background is i got out of an extremely toxic relationship where i also had to teach him everything, but it ended bc he wasn’t open to change & was mean to me. am i being stupid for trying to mold a man or should i be dating someone who’s in the same stage of life, maturity, and financial position as i am?\n",

The thing is, I am trying! I talk to him sweetly, tell him his feelings are valid, try to listen to his perspective. However, at our couple therapist’s suggestion, I recently started pushing back at some of his assumptions during our fight (as in, yes I want to be friends with my ex but not because I’m in love with him but because I want to be friends with him).

      "Title: My [37M] Wife [36F] Wants Me to Leave Because I Keep Avoiding Hard Conversations\n",
      "Body text: My wife and I have had a rocky marriage for the last 16 years, mainly because of some situations I have caused. We started dating at 18, and both of us come from broken homes and we got married at 21 and had our daughter not long after getting married. Throughout our marriage, I have had issues with planning long term, dealing with impulsivity and avoiding difficult conversations. My wife has given me grace, and given me chances to fix things which I have tried to do, but usually have not met her complete requirements to which she then makes concessions for me. It has also always been really important to my wife that we move out of our hometown, and it is something that we have planned to do since we got together, but has always fallen through usually because of my lack of planning or effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my work is relocating us cross country in a few months, and I have let plans fall behind. We also have my daughter going away to school for the first time in a few months, and the perfect storm of big events that require planning is causing us to need to have some really important conversations which I keep avoiding. I know that these conversations will ultimately lead to fights over money and how good we are doing, my lack of financial planning, etc. Now, she wants me to leave the house because I have kept pushing them out so far, and all I want to do now is to just have them. Get it all out and have the conversations so we can either move forward together, or apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue now is she doesn't even want to talk to me about those things, she just wants me out. I don't know what to do anymore. I really want to work it out with my wife, I want her to move with me and I really want to make her feel fulfilled, but even if I can get her to have the conversation with me now, I feel like I will just end up disappointing her with the outcome and causing an even bigger more volatile fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also been struggling as I have been in counseling the last few months, and recently got diagnosed with ADHD. Through talking with my counselor and researching, it really seems like a lot of my relationship issues are common with ADHD, and that is throwing me emotionally. I haven't gotten effective medication yet, and I don't want to use this to excuse everything, but it's just hard to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR: I have a history of not planning long term, and that has caused my wife stress and she now wants me to leave because I am avoiding hard conversations about our plans to move cross country. I know I need to have these talks now, and I want to, but she just says it's too late. How can I approach this?**\n",

      "Kate said she had been at the bar with 2 friends (I know and like both of them) and told me what she had to drink. I was surprised at how little she drank because it was the same amount we would normally drink when going for dinner, a few glasses of wine and a cocktail. She admitted she was only slightly tipsy.\n",

      "\n",
      "The four of them went to get some food and Max then dropped each one off until it was just him and Kate. Kate said she didn't want him to drive the 20 mins to her parents place after working all day so would just order an Uber from his apartment. She went into his apartment to order the Uber but couldn't get one. Max suggested she should crash in his bed and he would take the sofa, he would then drop her off in the morning. Kate refused and continued to try to find an Uber.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were sitting on Max's bed and he kissed her. She kissed him back and they ended up having sex (she confirmed again that it was consensual) After that she broke down crying from guilt and Max took her home. She cried for another hour then tried to call me to tell me what she had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to stop a number of times because Kate kept breaking down and crying hysterically. She told me it was a huge mistake, she got caught up in the moment, it was terrible, she only loves me blah blah blah.\n",

I also told her that we would both remain faithful, would get a full STD panel and she would tell our mutual friends and family what happened. If she sticks to these conditions, I would be willing to meet again to see if there was any way forward other than divorce.\n",

      "\n",
      "Edit: just to clarify because many of you seem to be focusing on this point. I've had mutual friends and my wife's family send me nasty messages, turn up at my house etc because according to Kate, I kicked her out over an argument. My request was that Kate tells them it's because she has been unfaithful, not a full rundown of everything that happened.\n",

      "Body text: I wanted to give an update on my post from a few days ago since everyone who commented was so helpful.  \n",
      "I talked to my husband and asked him if he was taking testosterone as many of the commenters thought he was. He said no and was curious why I asked. So we talked a bit and I really pressed him hard on what was going through his mind a year ago to make him change so much and I was able to tease 2 things out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first was an incident at work. It happened about six months before he made his transformation and I knew about it at the time because he told me. He didn’t make a really big deal about it and barely mentioned it after telling me so I just forgot it even happened until he mentioned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "My husband is a VP of Finance at a rather large private company and two members of his staff were engaging in an affair. The woman involved in the affair was married and about my age and her husband had started to call the office. So it became a thing he had to deal with since he was their boss. He told me at the time but I guess this saga dragged on for some months and when the woman in question began to open up to others in the office regarding the reason she had the affair, some of those reasons hit home for my husband. Her husband was behaving much like he was. So he said that isn’t going to be me and set out to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "The second thing I teased out of him is that he quit watching porn. Now I do want to say that I don’t care that he watched porn, I do myself on occasion. But when he watched it and obviously finished himself afterward, it drained any desire he had for me. I guess he started when the kids were really young and I was just exhausted all the time and he just kept it up because it was easy. He quit because to fix our marriage he had to get that desire back for me. So he did it.  \n",
      "So after this conversation a lot of things make sense. I also understand why he didn’t want to tell me. He didn’t want me to think that the possibility that I could cheat had entered his mind. And the porn is sort of self explanatory.\n",

      "Hi, I’m new here. I create this account because something happened to my husband about a year ago and I don’t know what to make of it.  \n",
      "My husband has always been a good man, and he’s a wonderful father. He also has a great career and very driven to succeed. But after the kids were born his passion for me had waned. He was once very affectionate and flirty and he couldn’t keep his hands off me. We had date nights and would take weekend trips filled with kissing, hand holding and a lot of sex. But after the kids all of that began to fade and it continued to the point that I felt like we were roommates. I kept myself in shape for him and initiated sex often. He would never turn me down but it was lazy. It was basically get off quick and go to sleep. So after a while I just stopped imitating.  \n",
      "This continued for years and I had just grown used to it. I still loved him, I had no desire to cheat or divorce. I just figured this is what happens after kids and I’ll just deal with it.  \n",
      "Then, about a year ago he got a babysitter and asked me if I wanted to go away for the weekend just the two of us. I was shocked but agreed. And the entire weekend he was affectionate and flirty and just fun. He hadn’t acted this way in years. He was a completely different guy and that included in the bedroom too. This may be TMI but my husband hadn’t performed oral sex on me in 10 years and every time he had before he was kind of terrible at it. But while we were away he just did it without asking and he was amazing at it.  \n",
      "This new attitude continued when we got home and a few months after that I started to notice that he had lost weight. Shortly after that he started to look more toned as well. He had gotten a dad bod but now he looked better than when we got married. I won’t lie, I had difficulty keeping my hands off him.  \n",
      "He’s basically become the perfect husband overnight, I don’t know what happened. He says he just wanted to be a better husband but there was no event that triggered it outside of turning 40. Could that be it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve read that middle aged men sometimes get in shape because they are looking to cheat. But that’s not the case. He’s never cheated or had any desire too. We have lifestyle 360 for the kids and I see where he is. It’s work and home. I also see all his texts since we share an iPad.  \n",
      "So I’m kind of stumped.  \n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "I (32M) have been married to my wife Kate (30F) for 4 years, together for 9. Our relationship has been amazing, loving and supportive. We have good communication, hardly ever argue and our bedroom life has gone from strength to strength over the years. We discussed cheating in the past and I was always clear that we would be over if it ever happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kate went home to visit her family last weekend which was fairly normal. Before she left on the Friday night, we had a minor argument about keeping the house tidy so our communication was limited on Saturday but I knew she was going out to meet some friends at a bar. I trusted her 100% so didn't think anything of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before I fell asleep, I text her saying that I hope she had a nice night. When I woke up on Sunday morning I had a missed call from Kate at 4 am so I immediately called her to check if she was okay but no answer. After a few hours I tried again a few times but still no answer. Around an hour later I got a message saying she was fine and was driving back soon. \n",

      "Kate got home late afternoon and looked awful. She had clearly been crying, was not wearing any makeup (unusual for her) and looked like a shell of a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew right away something was wrong but she wouldn't let me hug her and would barely speak. I sat her down on the couch and made her some tea. I gently encouraged her to tell me what was wrong and she burst into uncontrollable tears for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to comfort her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then proceeded to tell me, stopping every few words, that she had slept with someone last night after the bar. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, something in my brain broke. I can't describe it any other way. I immediately got up and jumped in my car and drove off. I went to a park and walked around it for about an hour. Kate was calling my phone constantly and I turned it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got home, I grabbed two suitcases from the garage and went to our bedroom. I threw some of Kate's clothes and shoes into them and left them by the front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kate was lying on the floor in the living room, curled up into a ball sobbing. I called her best friend who lives nearby and told her that Kate needed a place to stay and a ride to her place and that Kate could explain everything to her later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told Kate I was leaving for an hour and that her friend was coming to pick her up. She grabbed on to my legs trying to stop me from leaving. When I returned home again, Kate was gone and so were the cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, with a clearer head, I answered one of Kate's many calls and told her that I needed her to send me an email with as much details as possible of that night and if she leaves anything out, there will be no hope of reconciliation. I received this email on Monday night but still haven't opened it.\n",

      "Title: I (38M) accidentally ended up tracking my wife's(38F) periods and realized that my entire life revolves around her cycle...concerned about her health and wondering if I should say something?\n",
      "Body text: My wife and I (both 38) have been married for about 12 years and have 2 kids in elementary school. She's the love of my life, and everything you read below should be rooted in the fact that I love her and I'm trying to be a good husband to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically I pulled an Abed from Community...I started becoming concerned that my wife was bipolar because she would sometimes be extremely energetic and fun and sexual and just kind was this force to be reckoned with. Other times, she would become so argumentative and standoffish and unstable but also withdrawn and depressed that I worried she might do something to hurt herself. She always chalked it up as depression symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love her so much, and it was obviously not fun for me to become her figurative punching bag, but I always had hope because of the other person she could be. So in a moment of frustration after being told that what I was describing in a fight about her behavior wasn't even happening, I decided I was going to track some of her behaviors for a year to see if I could learn anything that might help and to make sure I wasn't making this up. I didn't want a \"gotcha\", I just wanted to see if I really was remembering things inaccurately because I felt like I knew what was going on but the gaslighting about my own memory was effective.  As I've alluded to, I basically ended up tracking her cycle. From the time her period ends until maybe 10 days after, our average sex frequency is daily and hot. She gets a lot accomplished, and if anything she's too ambitious about the number of projects she takes on.  House projects, volunteering stuff, visiting a friend who's lonely, organizing family outings or extended family events...it's like she has more energy than time to accomplish everything she wants to do. She's a wonderful wife and mother, showing lots of love and affection.  I'd marry that woman twice. For the other 20 days a month, we have a sexless marriage. She's kind of just getting by emotionally, at best. She works out less and she is moodier. In the week leading up to her period, she's borderline abusive. I try to get the kids out of the house as much as possible so they have fewer hours with her and generally just stay away from her. If she was always that person, I'd divorce her, but I know that it's just cyclical now. Knowing about how she changes through a 30 day cycle has made me a better husband and better at anticipating her needs, although like Abed, I think it would be creepy to explain how I got so much more thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm not the first guy to notice that his girlfriend or wife is harder to be around at certain times of the month, and I'm trying not to be a neanderthal here.  I've got some life experience, I've been in other serious relationships, and I'm a caring and loving husband: this isn't normal. Her swings through the month are a much, much wider variance than most people experience. Your average person seems to maintain who they are from week to week with just a little change up or down, but she's like 2 or 3 different human beings over the course of a cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I be worried about her health? If I should, is there a way to make these worries known without sounding like a psycho who tracked his wife's cycle? I do think this has gotten worse as we aged and after she had our 2 kids. I wonder if becoming a mother led to some PPD and some knock-on effects, but I've never heard of \"period onset biopolar disorder\" which is what I feel like I'm experiencing.\n",

      "Body text: [Link to the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1csuyby/my_25m_girlfriend_23f_has_been_weird_since_having/), TL;DR for the OP: My non-Jewish girlfriend came to my family's seder and my parents overexplained all the Jewish concepts, and then she seemed more distant but wouldn't discuss it with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a weird fucking week, so I apologize if this isn't the most coherent update.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I posted I really appreciated the advice noting that I might be making some assumptions about what was upsetting my gf, \"Lily,\" so I asked her if we could talk and that I just wanted to be open with each other. She agreed to meet up on Friday after work, when we normally would anyway for a date. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I made a nice meal for her at my apartment, her favorite thing that I cook (this creamy, lemony pasta dish) and then afterwards I tried to just kind of have this open-ended conversation about what I noticed (e.g. how she's been more distant) and was there something wrong? She was really hesitant, just looking kind of nervous, and then she just kind of blurted out that the seder made her uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so that's what I thought, right? So I figure, okay, let's talk this through. It turns out that while she knew I was Jewish, she didn't think I was \"so Jewy\" until she came to the seder. I cringed and told her that the word \"Jewy\" was inappropriate and she did *not* like me saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a part of the Passover seder where we say \"next year in Jerusalem,\" just like a kind of hopeful attitude in light of the Jewish diaspora, I think? Anyway, she said that she found that part really inappropriate given the current war in Gaza. I told her that those things were not connected; my family has no real connection to Israel and the seder is a hundreds (maybe thousands?) years old tradition that long predates the modern state of Israel. She didn't seem to care about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I finally asked her if she had a problem being in a relationship with me given my Jewishness. She emphatically stated that no, she loves me. But it was a shock and she \"needs time.\" That really threw me though, and I asked her what she needs time for, but she didn't have a real answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to my parents for the weekend to just kind of get away, since I wasn't sure what all this meant. While I was gone, I got an alert on my phone that an AirTag was following me. I found it hidden in my car. I called Lily and she denied it was hers but I was pretty sure she was lying since she's not a good liar. Finally she admitted she was trying to see where I was going and if it was to the TEMPLE?!? I honestly haven't been inside a temple since my Bar Mitzvah almost 13 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, it should go without saying that I ended it. I blocked her on everything. I destroyed her AirTag, too. No clue what the fuck is wrong with her, but... it feels antisemitic, I guess. Wish I had a happier update. I thought she was the one, but fuck me I guess.\n",

I mean, I think I have a pretty stereotypically Jewish sense of humor, but maybe she didn't put that together. Anyway, the more I think about it the more I realize what other people said here is true: she wanted me to be generically white, and when she realized I was more \"ethnic\" than that, she had an issue with it. That's antisemitism, full stop.\n",

      "Body text: Me 35F and my husband 31M have been together for 10 years, married for 6. He has OCD and for the last 8 months or so, he’s completely convinced himself that he has ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease, what Steven Hawking had). He’s spent thousands of dollars on ER visits, seen multiple doctors and a neurologist who have all said he doesn’t have it, he doesn’t have any symptoms of ALS, etc. But it’s all he talks about, all he thinks about, all day every day for the last 8 months. He goes to therapy once a week and he’s been on medication for his OCD since he was like 8 years old. He recently switched to a new medication which seemed like it was helping but now he’s back to the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "I try to act normal, to keep our home life happy and functioning for our 2 kids (14 and 4) but he brings a black cloud over everything. Tonight we were out to a casual dinner and he just wasn’t talking to me, was on his phone and just seemed so angry and dismissive of me every time I tried to start a conversation, so finally I asked him why do you just not like me anymore? He said he does like me, but he hates being alive and hates everything in life. He said he hates even trying to talk to me because all he wants to talk about is ALS and he knows I’m tired of hearing about it and having the same conversation about it. He said nothing in life brings him joy except our son, but that thinking of our son makes him sad because he knows he’s gonna be dead in a year due to ALS. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t really know how to reply to that. I’ve been living with him through this and through his OCD but I just don’t know if I can do it anymore. I don’t know if this marriage is even worth saving because at this point I feel like I’ve lost all love for him and he’s not even the same person he was 8 months ago. I keep hoping he’ll snap out of it but even then I don’t know if I can ever go back to how we were. And it wasn’t all that great to begin with anyway. So my question is do I keep trying to stick this out and help him through this, or do I focus on myself and my kids?\n",

      "Body text: My wife and I have been married for 10 years and we really do have an amazing relationship. We have two beautiful kids, a nice home, I own my own business and things are great. We have a great sex life and social life outside of our family life with kids. My wife, after years in various parts of the industry, got her real estate license about four years ago. It was something to fill time, keep busy and make a little extra income.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company that she’s been with for the last two or three years, has a real emphasis on social networking events and it has caused a rift between us. I have attended one or two of these events and I’ve left them all with a troubling feeling. I would say nine out of the 10 people I met rubbed me the wrong way. Many of them are very self-absorbed, could only talk about themselves and their success and are very flirtatious with my wife.  To be fair she is incredibly attractive but approachable and friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last few events that my wife has attended, resulted in her coming home late and involved excessive drinking. There are two things that really bother me about it, I feel that her professional relationships with men at her company have become more social than professional and these networking events seem more like a excuse to go and hang out with other guys and drink. While many of them are married I don’t trust their intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, my wife attended an event and we agreed she would be back by 12. I even went out of my way to make a point of asking her to be responsible and to limit the amount that she drinks. Well, 2 AM rolled around and there was no sign of her. She wouldn’t respond to text messages. I could see she was still in the general area of the event which was over an hour from our house finally after calling a few times, she answered I could tell she was, extremely drunk she told me she was staying at a hotel with one of her girlfriends and I had to quickly remind her that I had to be up at 4:30 AM to get ready for work. Long story short she took an Uber to the train and ended up driving her car home drunk. As if this wasn’t bad enough, I noticed on her phone, she had very flirtatious text messages with multiple married and single men.\n",

      "I’ve really had enough of this career choice, she doesn’t seem responsible enough to attend these events and it is causing a big divide between the two of us.\n",

      "\n",
      "TL;DR\n",
      "My wife’s job has turned into social hour events, drinking too much, flirting with other men and it’s putting a strain on our relationship.  I’ve addressed my concerns, she apologizes and knows it’s wrong but keeps doing it anyways. Where do I go from here?  I want her to quit. \n",

      "I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points: \n",

      "\n",
      "BUT\n",
      "\n",
      "Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask \"Do you want to have sex with me?\" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally \"fuck me again\" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?\n",
      "\n",
      "I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again. \n",

      "\n",
      "If you don't want to read the whole post, the synopsis is essentially that my (F28) husband (M28) cheated on me after 8.5 years together while I was 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's now June 11th and my daughter just turned 8 months old. My water broke and I drove myself to the hospital and then labored & gave birth alone. My daughter was born two weeks early only, and she was completely healthy and had no issues. She is doing AMAZING, and the love I have for her is so all encompassing that sometimes I don't even know what to do. She's a great baby, and is so loved by not just myself, but my dad, my brothers, my aunt - she is adored by my whole family, and because we live with my dad, her birth has brought all of us together closer than we've been in a long, *long* time. I absolutely love being her mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "My ex husband was served divorce papers in February by my dad, who volunteered to be the one to do it, and our divorce was finalized in May !! The way that my feelings for him changed almost in an instant after I had given birth to my daughter was shocking, but it was like as soon as she was born just the thought of this man disgusted me. He visits for about an hour a week, once a week, and has done since she's been born. We have a parenting plan in the works but every time it's drawn up by my lawyer, he finds something else that's wrong with it and choses to not sign. It's been very irritating having to deal with this man who I once loved and now don't recognize, and watch as he pretends on social media that he is an active, attentive father when I've done quite literally everything for this baby and he does the barest minimum he can get away with.\n",
      "\n",
      "This next part may be very shocking, but the girl he cheated on me with and moved into an apartment with directly from our marital home ended up cheating on him literally within the same week that our divorce finalized and she was kicked out of his place. It took about a year, but he did come back groveling after all, which was absolutely wild to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the actual shocking part of this update: I have met a man !! After spending my entire pregnancy alone and heartbroken, I had sworn off men and relationships and then this one just kind of appeared in my life. I have horrible trust issues now, and it's been really, really hard considering the deep betrayal that happened to me last year, but my boyfriend is the most gentle, calm, understanding guy I could have found. We met when my daughter was two months old and he started taking me on little weekend dates for just a couple of hours at a time, and was always very considerate of me having a newborn (which he reassured me several times over that it was not an issue, and he actually has experience working with kids in the past) and then in March we had the conversation and defined the relationship. In these 6 months, he has met my family and has become one of my daughter's favorite people. I've met his brother & sister in law and when his parents come into town later this month, he's introducing me and we're all getting dinner together. I feel lucky to have this man in my life, and a stable father figure for my daughter, and I am really hoping he is actually who he's been showing me he is. Obviously when my ex husband came to apologize and cry for what he'd done to me, I was already very locked in with my boyfriend, but even if I hadn't been the answer would have been NO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our house has not yet sold, and I'm kind of losing my mind about it, but there's nothing to really be done to help that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this may sound like revenge corn, but I promise it's not !! Karma has just been working hard for me and my little bean \\~ my boyfriend dotes on us and makes me believe in love again; he is so handsome and so sweet and the complete opposite of who my ex husband ended up being. I am really hoping he is a good egg, because I accidentally fell in love with him when I didn't mean to, but I do now know that I was strong enough to leave a marriage with a baby on the way so if he ends up screwing me over, I know I'll be strong enough to leave him too. The fact that my ex's affair partner cheated on him absolutely tickles me, to be completely honest. I'm still living with my dad (+ my two dogs & cat that he abandoned me with during my pregnancy) but honestly it could absolutely be worse. My dad helps as much as he can and loves his grandbaby so much, and it's been so sweet watching him turn into this absolute softie of a grandpa.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if anyone remembers me/my post or if this update is necessary at all but !! Here it is !! I am big time not in love with the guy who cheated on me, left me, and is an absent father to the baby I grew all on my own and raise all on my own. \n",
      "\n",

Anywho, thanks for all the love to me and my baby girl, and the well wishes with my boyfriend !! My reddit experience has been very nice because of all of yall.\n",

We have really good times and also very bad times. I got pregnant months into the relationship and we since have two children together which is the majority of the reason we are still together despite all we have been through. My partner has this fetish that is getting to be exhausting. Hes obsessed with lesbians/wanting me to be bisexual/hookup with woman casually. Hes made me a Snapchat and tinder, pretending to be me.. talking to these girls, making plans and then when I don't want to do them, he gets mad and says that we will break up if I don't do it. It's gotten to the point now, where if i don't have sex with a woman he says he will not marry me. I don't want to do it, I'm not into woman. He knows I just say things in the moment to get him turned on, but I don't mean it. I can't do it anymore.. but I know once I stop, there will be no more sex or probably even intimacy at all.

      "Body text: Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cj440x/my_26f_friends_26f_boyfriend_28m_gave_me_an/)\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarise the original post: My (26F) friend's (26F) perpetually broke boyfriend (28M) gave me a gift for my birthday. It initially looked like a thoughtfully chosen, normal gift with a lovely connection to a recent trip to my mother's homecountry I took in winter, but after growing suspicious of the quality of the materials, I realised that it was in fact an antique worth hundreds of Euros. Theories as to what happened included him not being aware of the item's value, possibly having bought it from someone who didn't know what they were selling, or him trying to somehow hurt his girlfriend/my friend and/or trying to hit on me in a bizarre, inappropriate way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up texting my friend and telling her that I had researched the gift and discovered it was worth a very inappropriate amount of money. She was VERY surprised by the entire situation, especially considering her boyfriend (now ex, but more on that later) is perpetually broke and makes her foot the bill for their shared lifestyle. She came over to my place and together, we called him on speakerphone, where she demanded some answers. Long story short: He STOLE it. From his OWN MOTHER.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's still being a bit shady about some details, but we managed to piece together the sequence of events to a satisfactory degree:\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend was supposed to be coming to my birthday party straight from work. When she left her office, she realised she had forgotten the gift she had planned for me (a book) at home. Since she was already running late and her place is pretty far from both her work and my flat, she chose to text her boyfriend, who was having dinner at his parent's home at the time. She knew he was there, and knew his parents live close to me, so she asked him to just buy a copy of the same book at a bookshop on his way to my place so they'd have a gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reasons known only to him, he did not choose this simple, reasonable solution to the 'we forgot our gift' issue. Instead of leaving five minutes early to pick up another copy of the book, he instead chose to just GRAB A RANDOM ITEM OFF HIS MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM SHELF. WITHOUT ASKING HER. He had no idea what it was, just thought it looked pretty, took it, and stuffed it in a paper bag. He also did not text back my friend or react to her calls, so she (reasonably) assumed he hadn't read her message and ended up going BACK to get the book, which was why they arrived separately and with separate gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the boyfriend had unknowingly gifted me not just any antique, no! This item had been passed down to his mother from her THREE-TIMES-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER. It had been in his family's possession for literal centuries, and was the ONLY tangible connection she (his mother) still had to her homecountry, which, incidentally, is also *my* mother's homecountry - which he wasn't aware of, meaning that what I thought was a thoughtful connection to my trip there was a total coincidence! He had no idea of the item's cultural significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend immediately made him call his mum to fess up to the entire situation. His mother had been running herself ragged trying to figure out where this item disappeared to for DAYS. Obviously, she never suspected thievery, and was blaming herself terribly for having lost something this important. The boyfriend ACTUALLY HAD THE GALL to try to convince her not to make her call his mum! He wanted to sweep the entire thing under the rug! Of course, we didn't let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother came by my place this morning and I returned the item to her, along with some apologies for not starting investigations immediately and some nice chocolate. We had a lovely conversation about our shared cultural heritage, I assured her that the item had been treated with dignity for the entire time it was in my possession, and we parted ways with a hug.

      "Title: [Update] Ex [42F] is creating so much drama in my[37M] life that I am having trouble coping. Considering giving up my kids just to get it all to stop.\n",
      "Body text: I was looking in my profile and saw my post in this subreddit from 7 years ago, as my Ex was causing so much chaos that I was doubting everything. That post is linked here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/ScafVaff3L\n",
      "\n",
      "I took everything to heart and implemented several things right away. I became a grey rock… and started documenting my ass off. \n",
      "I consulted my lawyers, and they said they advised several steps. The first of which was a 730 evaluation. (This is an evaluation done by a psychologist) that process took a really long time as the 730 evaluator got very sick halfway through.  That took 10 months. At the end the report essentially read “Mom is volatile and disorganized and that dad’s home would be a more stable home for the children. However, there is hope that mom is starting to improve, so if things are still bad in 1 year it would be appropriate to change custody to dad”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a tough pill to swallow. Things were not better, and the chaos was just intermittent. So we just kept documenting, and doing our thing. Eventually, we started getting a lot of emails from teachers that Jill in particular, was often not bathed, never had her homework done, didn’t have school supplies and that she was falling way behind in her studies. We applied for a trial to review custody, and asked for primary custody to be swapped to us. That was at the end of 2019, and trial was set for May 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "So as you can imagine, once COVID hit, everything got delayed. There was a large amount of events in 2020. COVID shut down. Donna and I had a child, Rebecca. And then my Ex started denying visitation to Jill and Marvin. Every 2 weeks I would go down… wait in front of the house. No kids would emerge. Sometimes I would have the police come, not to force anything, but to get the documentation in terms of a case number. This went on for 4 months, before I was able to start getting visitation again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, the trial was set for summer of 2021 and went for 3 days and I had over 500 pages of documentation. Day 1 was entirely testimony from the Co-Parenting therapist we had been seeing for 5 years. She testified that my Ex was the most difficult client she had ever worked with in her career, that my ex never followed a single agreement in session, and that she was a pathological liar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last day of testimony was my ex, where she was caught lying on the stand, and was presented with evidence that she had been secretly taking the children to a medical professional for 2 years that I had explicitly not agreed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "So starting in Aug 2021, the judge ordered the kids come live with me, primary custody and limiting my ex to 4 days a month. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s now been 3 years: When Jill was in 5th grade she had a 26% in math, and a 40% in English. For the last 3 years, she has maintained a 4.0 every single year, and will be starting High School in Honors Geometry, Honors English and AP Biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marvin has also been doing well also and just finished his first year of middle school with a 4.0 GPA, and is loving his coding and robotics elective.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have new clothes, and have learned new skills and responsibilities. Donna has been crucial in setting up patterns to help with success in school. Their rooms are both immaculate, and they are the ones doing it with very little direction from us. They are happy and finally involved in activities and sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our little Rebecca adores them both, and I will often find all 3 of them cuddled up together as one of the older two reads a book to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jill made the decision recently to stop going on visits to her mom. The chaos and drama started being directed at her… along with lack of food, clothes that fit, etc. Marvin is still going for visits and we are encouraging that as long as he is feeling safe there. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all things are going so well and the kids are doing incredible. There are hard moments still, but it has all been worth it, and we are able to shield them for the most part from any chaos their mom may want to start. \n",

      "Body text: I (F 27) have been married to my husband (28) since October. We love each other, it’s always been easy. He can be tough to handle sometimes but I can too, I can’t say I even suspected this. Last night, I had a couple of drinks, and I did something I really shouldn’t have. I kept having these thoughts for two days straight for absolutely no reason. The urge to ‘check his phone’ check his phone check his phone kept telling me. I didn’t want to because for absolutely no reason, I felt like I will find something that will cause troubles. I kept trying to fight the urge to do something so shitty, till I found his phone in the bathroom and I opened it. He was talking to a girl, saying ‘these pants you were wearing yesterday, you wanted to get spanked. She replied ‘I’m waiting for you’ and the conversation ended with ‘I love you’.\n",
      "Now I don’t even know this girl, I confronted him, he said she was a work mate and he didn’t act on it. He didn’t do anything ‘physical’ and that he’s sorry. Now I feel like absolute shit, how should I approach this? I didn’t tell my family yet, I’m just sitting here with so many thoughts going on and I don’t know what to do\n",

      "TL;DR my husband is cheating on me and we’ve been married less than a year. Is this salvageable. Should I end this\n",
      "\n",
      "edit: We’ve been together since high school. I loved him so much, ever since we were kids. It’s hard for me to read these comments because ‘dumping’ him isn’t easy for me to read. I know he cheated deep down, and I’m starting to think maybe it wasn’t the first time. I live in Egypt, divorce is a pretty big thing around here. If I really proceed through that step, it’s going to be incredibly hard on me. I love him and I feel like I can ‘t possibly trust him ever again. We’ve always been happy, I don’t know what went wrong\n",

      "\n",
      "Me (29F) and my husband (34M) had a threesome with his friend (32M) a few weeks ago. This is something we’ve done before but in the past we’ve only had female partners. We’ve never had an issue. Until now I guess? \n",

      "\n",
      "The threesome was really good and I won’t lie his friend and I were super into each other. I honestly didn’t think too much of it though until about a week after when his friend came over for drinks. We were all sitting in the living room and my husband just blurts out “you two should have sex without me” I honestly choked on my drink when he said it. I laughed but when I glanced at my husband he looked completely serious. I told him I wouldn’t be doing that and he dropped the subject until his friend left. He went on to say he thought his friend and I connected in a way that he (my husband) and I never have and if I’ve found something good I shouldn’t give it up. I told him I wouldn’t be sleeping with his friend ever again and he insisted I’d change my mind and that he was ok with it as long as I told him about it when I decided I wanted to see the friend again. \n",

      "Body text: My bf (21) and I (18) are both in college (we go to the same school) and we recently started dating. We have only known each other for about three weeks. He has had a pretty rough history of people cheating on him in relationships. The other day, he INSISTED on coming to my room and brought bed risers (I have a single dorm. I did not want or need bed risers.) Without my approval, he began lofting my bed while I was in the shower and it is now about 6 feet off the ground. Basically, now the bed is really unstable because (I have no idea where he got the risers) but they’re probably from temu with how cheap and unsupportive they are. He told my neighbor that he did it so “no guys can come over and fuck on the bed.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I think this is pretty unreasonable. I don’t like having to keep a chair in the middle of my room so I can get on my bed. And I am not planning on cheating. What should I do? Should I talk to the RA? \n",

      "So, hello. A little over five years ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for advice on how to handle my incredibly painful unrequited love for my best friend. I'd honestly forgotten about this until making a password reset on another account, and saw \"tobz13\" among my email search results. But as I read through the post, I remember how very comforting and terrifying the responses to my post was, being a more or less unanimous \"ask him out\" that scared my ass to death. Sorry that this isn't really a happy update, but... I don't know. It felt weird seeing something I wrote in what feels like a different life, and the people who responded seemed so genuinely kind and trying to help, I feel like I weirdly owe some kind of update?\n",
      "\n",
      "Especially for that one, dear, sweet commenter whose account is now deleted. I so wish I'd have a way to reach out to them, because that was one of the most thoughtful comments I think I've ever gotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just to recap, with hindsight: I really, really was in love with this man and I had been for about two years. Like, full nine yards in love. Struggling to breathe when he talked about someone else but still cheering him on because he deserved happiness-levels of in love. If that sounds a bit like obsession to you, then that's because it probably was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing about unrequited love, the thing that really sucks about it, is that it's incredibly hard to move on from, but until you do move on, your brain keeps obsessing about it to the point where it can be impossible to get anything done. It had been two years of that when I made that post, two years of pining and pain and an ever-growing pile of crushed hopes, and I think I was going a little bit insane, constantly swinging between butterflies and love highs when I was with my friend and the crushing feeling of rejection every time he'd say goodbye. And the obsession over things like how long he'd look at me, how long he'd let a hug last, how fast he'd respond to my texts, things which could either make or break my entire day depending on what the answer was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Onto the actual update, after that primer. About a month and a half or so after I made that post, still trying to hype myself up to actually ask this man out, I accidentally became a head organiser for an event at the university I was studying at for the moment. Long story short, the person managing me was Not Kind, I was extremely overworked from the event on top of writing a thesis, I was equally stressed out in my private life due to the whole situation with my best friend, and I ended up going through a pretty severe case of burnout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Add onto everything that I'd developed an addiction to alcohol to try to handle everything, and was also experiencing what was most likely a drug-induced paranoid psychosis, and I was a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up moving back in with my dad in September, and spent about a year doing nothing but sleeping, crying, playing Skyrim and going to rehab and therapy. Start of 2021, I went back to school, and slowly recovered. I've been sober since 2020, the paranoia hasn't completely gone away but it's more manageable (I used to think my landlord listened to me through a radon measurement device, and at least that's over), and I think I've got a work-life balance figured out that helps me not overwork myself or go into freetime lethargy because I've got too much time off. It was long, and painful, but I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're wondering where my best friend was in all of this, I... Honestly don't know. I went back to look at our text messages, and from what I can see he tried to call me a few times in early September, I didn't respond, and then nothing until around Christmas when he wondered if I wanted to meet up sometime. I said yes, and then never followed through. He hasn't texted me since january 4th, 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to be clear, I don't blame him for not reaching out more. My non-responding is what killed that friendship. I know, because it also killed every other friendship I had at the time. I don't know, \"alcohol addiction, deep depression and crippling paranoia\" may be a fair *explanation* to one day stop responding to any of your friends, but I still deeply regret those choices. If I were to make a relationships post today, it would be on how the fuck you word an apology after behaviour like that, five years down the road.\n",

      "Sorry. I feel like this is starting to become a journal. I'm gonna stop my reflections there. So, about my 'love' for my best friend, with some years of hindsight and therapy behind me:\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I was in love with him. I think I was in love with the idea of him, and I think I was obsessed for sure, but looking back... I don't know. I genuinely don't know. I think a part of me really liked the fact that this was a person who so clearly wasn't interested in me (genuinely, if he was, that would *shock me* to find out, because he spent two and a half years ignoring the in hindsight VERY OBVIOUS attempts I made to deepen the relationship. Some examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* him saying he's waiting for the right person, me responding \"sometimes I feel like I already have. Do you ever feel like that?\" and him going \"nah, I don't think so\"\n",
      "* me following that up with \"maybe you just don't know, the heart is weird sometimes\" and him going \"i'm pretty sure i'd know.\"\n",
      "* one time we talked about why people fall in love, and I genuinely tried to convince him a deep friendship was all you needed, while he insisted that there needed to be a level of sexual attraction as well.\n",
      "* I tried to get him to do that \"36 questions that will make you fall in love\" thing with me.\n",
      "* I kept trying to find excuses to hold his hand (rest in peace, my palm reading career, you were nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at finger touching) and him resolutely never going along with it\n",
      "* Ditto, but with hugs, arm touching, and sitting just a little too close whenever we went out so I could \"hear him better\", which he normally responded to by going \"we should go outside so you can hear better if it's too loud in here\". Very thoughtful, but very much not what the goal was.\n",
      "* one night, when we were alone in my apartment after a club event, after a particularly long shared Look, I asked him what he was thinking about in that kind of \"i don't want to break the illusion\" soft voice you put on when you're really fucking close to someone you like, and his response was \"I don't know if I agree that Geertz's metaphor about blinking makes that much sense, actually\".\n",
      "* (For context, we'd bickered about that earlier in the night, since we'd just read some article about it in class. I did not expect it to make a comeback at that point.)\n",
      "* Another night, when we were out together and there had been a lot of Looks and closely-leaned-in laughing together, and he pulls me to one side by the hand to talk to me about something, heart racing, only to ask me if I know if one of my friends is single because he thinks she's really fucking cute and might have been looking at him all night)\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, at least some of this stuff is sort of funny.  I have no idea if he knew, or knows now, that I was in love with him. I wouldn't be surprised if some of my old friends eventually told him, but of course he's never reached out about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But yes, I think I kinda liked the security of this person who clearly didn't like me back. Not that I was doing well with the heartache, but there's a certain kind of fucked-up comfort that comes from pining for someone who doesn't want you back. Like, the highs I'd get when I got something that felt like 'confirmation' made up for the lows of crying in my apartment stairway when I got home after a 'denial'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I mostly just feel so bad for him and ashamed of myself. Regardless of whether he knew or not, and I'm trying to cling to the fact that he seemed to at least continue wanting to be friends as some indicator that he never felt creeped out or uncomfortable, my behaviour was pretty fucking creepy. And in the end, once I did get that distance between us, the feelings went away after some six months or so. My therapist recommended not meeting this person again, for my own sake, and by early 2020 I wasn't so painfully in love anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "A while later I'd end up meeting a guy I clicked with just as much, who actually liked me back and showed it. We've been together for almost three years now, and are talking about starting to try for kids at some point soon. He'd like us to get married first, but is also insisting he wants to be the one to propose so I'm just walking around waiting for the day. Even if it's not a huge surprise or secret, he just wants to get that moment of going down on one knee, and who am I to deny him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm slowly growing old and boring. I'm sober, I go to my boring, stable, middle career 9-5 job, I save for my retirement and travelling on the summers, I help my dad out on his farm, I crochet little animals for my newborn niece. I come home to a man who plays his silly videogames, I play my silly videogames, we go for walks and to the museum and bicker about whether to get fat on takeout or not. I have some regrets about how my early 20s ended up playing out, but by god, I wouldn't want to go back.\n",

While I like most of my new in-laws, Ben has always rubbed me the wrong way with his behavior.

      "To be honest, I feel somewhat sorry for Ben. Liam was diagnosed with high functioning autism when he and Ben were kids. As a result, their parents lavished more time and attention on Liam. This led to Ben being emotionally neglected and as a result, he acted out big time in their teens. He got into trouble and this led to their parents swinging the pendulum in the opposite direction, lavishing attention on Ben. Liam kept his head down and didn't say anything.

      "Title: My girlfriend thinks I’m hiding something, and I am… her engagement ring\n",
      "Body text: My girlfriend (26F) and I (27M) have been together for about 2 years now, and we have had an amazing relationship. I think we compliment each other really well and she makes me feel very happy. I decided about a month ago that I wanted to propose, so I went ahead and bought a ring. I have been planning a special proposal so I want it to be a surprise. As the date of the ring's delivery has gotten closer, I have been increasingly more guarded. I haven't been letting her use my phone like usual for fear that she might run into some of my etsy conversations with the vendor or see receipts in my emails. In the last few days I had been going out to check the mail many times over because I was anxious that the package had arrived and she might see it before I did. She has made a couple of off-handed comments and I noticed her getting suspicious of my behavior but I played it off pretty well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the ring was delivered today and I managed to sneak it in the house without her noticing and kept it in my office. Tonight, I waited until I thought she had fallen asleep and snuck into my office, and closed the door to examine the ring, hide it, and dispose of the packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as I had finished with everything, she barged into the office and asked what I was doing. I lied and told her I was watching some videos and didn't want to disturb her while she was sleeping. She read right through me and became very upset, as she knew I was hiding something from her. She stormed off to bed and shoved off my attempts at affection.\n",

      "Finally I told her, babe I need you to listen closely:\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not doing anything bad or wrong. I was doing something good, very good, and you would approve of it.\n",
      "There are cases, believe it or not, where it is right for a couple to hide things from each other. This is one of those cases. I am willing to speak to a third party, tell them what I was doing, and they will tell you I am justified.\n",
      "She became more frustrated and went to stay in the living room. I tried to reason with her to come back to bed, and she said she was busy doing \"her things\" and she didn't have to explain to me why or what she was doing... Now I am lying in bed alone with a pit in my stomach, writing to you all, unsure of how to approach the situation. How should I smooth things over?\n",

He has been planning with S and H for over a month to make sure the plan goes well. The plan was we were going to go to a steak house, grab some drinks and then go to a park to watch the fireworks and that’s when he was going to propose. Everything was going to plan when H said it was too hot to go to the park and she doesn’t want to sweat and suggested a different place. I and S said that was fine because I obviously didn’t know the plans and was just happy to watch fireworks wherever. I’m pretty sure S said it was fine too because H was hell bent that she didn’t want to sweat and it was too hot and she was worried about the car being stolen. \n",

      "Body text: This past Saturday, I went out for a girls' night with my best friends. There were 7 of us, and we were just enjoying ourselves and having fun. I made sure to keep my boyfriend of a year updated throughout the night, letting him know where I was and what we were doing. Despite this, he was blowing up my phone the entire time—facetiming me multiple times, constantly texting me, and repeatedly asking what I was up to.\n",
      "\n",
      "At no point did I take longer than an hour to reply to him, but he kept acting like I was ignoring him. At the end of the night, our designated driver dropped half of us off, which took a little over an hour since we were all going to different places. When I got to my friend's house to spend the night, I FaceTimed him to reassure him. Instead of asking me how my night went, he immediately started questioning why it took so long to drop everyone off, asking weird, contradicting questions because he wanted to \"catch me slipping.\" It was like he was trying to find a reason not to trust me, even though I’ve never given him any reason to not trust me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I tried to call him to talk things out, but he got annoyed, hung up on me, and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m really confused because this lack of trust came out of nowhere, and I don’t know how to handle the situation. Any advice on how to move forward?\n",

Because she couldn’t sleep, she kept waking me up every time i fell asleep. She was getting increasingly angry but claimed ear plugs weren’t working, insulting me for sleeping through the storm. When our son woke up, she then handed him to me at around 1am. He absolutely hates being with anyone other than her over night so he hysterically cried with me for well over an hour. This all woke up my 5 year old as well. Even after she took him back, she just continually woke me up every time i fell asleep. \n",

      "Body text: We’ve been high school sweethearts, did long distance, moved out, pets, got married, bought a house, the whole shindig. There was a time i was madly in love with this guy and couldn’t think how id be otherwise. \n",

      "Well during covid my husband found out he has “curly” hair. Its actually a ball of matted fluff with some wave to it, but sure it was news to us so we grew it out, tried curly products and all that, i encouraged it. But now its this greasy mop that sits atop his head. Mind you his hygiene is rough too. We recently had to have a talk about showering more than once a week, which he complied with for about that week. I along with his family and my mom have gently told him it looks horrid (think cynthia from rugrats or rick from rick and morty) and to consider at least a trim. It honestly smells bad too and it pisses me off every time it gets on me. Now he has me putting clips in it so i have to rummage through the grease to pull it out of his face. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last few months ive become less and less attracted to him and started noticing other things that i cant seem to unnotice that has always been there but now i cant get past it like before. Like his nasty ass grown out toe nails with gunk under it (its apparently my duty to cut it? Hes waiting on me to trim his toes) or that he’s been dieting to loose weight and now he looks like a fragile sick man (he’s healthy but loves the frail look). Atop all the physical stuff, theres the usual “mental” stuff like wont initiate or plan dates and taking him anywhere means dragging him or giving him a pep talk before hand to not ruin my day, needs to be told everything that needs to get done around the house, wont listen when i approach him with these things or will work on it for about a day or a few and revert back. \n",

On a day to day I keep it calm and mellow and try to get through it without loosing my cool but some days I just cant stand looking at that hair and everything else that comes with it and it pisses me off. Im sure to him it seems like I’m bipolar or mad at nothing but it feels like im mad at everything all at once if the wind blows wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is this normal? Ive been exposed to couples that stay together but seem like they just gotten worn down from each other my whole life, i don’t want that. Is there any way to fix it since talking to him doesn’t work? He’s a great dude in many departments, better than most, but at the very least i just want him to just grow up and show his full potential. I get that the hair makes him happy but cmon.. it’s not just about the hair. \n",

      "I have a full time job as an accountant and I work a 9 to 5 from home. I try to help him as much as I can. I usually go everyday from 6 to 11 or 12 to help him out basically doing everything I can (dishes, cleaning, barista duties). Mind you, I have never worked in a coffee shop before. My regular at a coffee shop would always be plain black coffee. So I don’t know much about fancy drinks, but I am trying my best to learn as much as I can and be as fast as I can. \n",

      "Then the morning starts again at 6am sharp. My boyfriend claims he cannot hear the alarm in the morning. So I have to physically get up and make him wake up so he can leave for work. It usually takes him half an hour to leave the house and by then I have up until 8am to sleep a bit more. Sometimes, I find it impossible to fall back asleep and by the time I feel sleepy again it’s time to get up for me. \n",
      "\n",

      "It’s been about a month since I posted. This is a bit long because so many kind Redditors reached out and gave me advice and shared their experiences and asked for an update. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I posted and stewed for a little while (and had a couple of drinks) I called my FIL. He and my wife are very close, and I respect his opinion. He has been married for a very long time, and seems to have a happy marriage and has good relationships all around with his family. I didn’t specify what issues we were having, but he was over at my house while I was staying in an Airbnb, so it was no secret we were having problems. He has more of a traditional marriage- and at some point asked what I had to lose by putting pressure on her to talk. I said I feared I would push her away more, and he pretty much told me that I was living in a separate house than my pregnant wife, freaking out about a potential divorce- what did I have to lose?  He advised me to “be a man” and come back to my house and lay it on the line. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I’d be coming over the next day. They asked if they could take L to buy some sparklers for the upcoming holiday and spend the night at their house. I agreed, and when I went to my house the next day I came in with flowers and stuff to make dinner. My wife asked what I was doing there, to which I replied I lived there and would like to sit down and talk. I gave a long apology for my actions and words. When I finished, I said it was her turn to tell me what was going on. She tried to claim nothing, that everything was okay. After awhile, I said my heart is broken, that we have been through some tough things together, fought for each other, and now you sit here and lie to my face. We both sat there and she cried for about 30 minutes until eventually she said she felt like our relationship would end if she was honest. I said I would hear her out, no matter what. \n",
      "\n",
      "She admitted it was hard that this would be her first kid and not mine. She didn’t think it would bother her and it didn’t until she was pregnant and that she laid in bed at night thinking if my ex would have wanted to raise L we would still be a family together and she wouldn’t matter. She expressed that seeing me emotional about our baby, or wanting to touch her bump, or treat her made her think of me and my ex and how I had already did all of the things she was excited to do with me. Near the beginning of her pregnancy, she had told a close friend that she couldn’t wait to have a baby with her soulmate- and her friend replied that she didn’t think soulmates had other children or “baby mamas” that it was two people meant only for each other. She was very upset and asked if I thought we were soulmates like she did. She described herself and our unborn child as my “sloppy seconds” family- that no one grew up dreaming of having kids by multiple different people. That she was just the substitute when the family I wanted didn’t work out. She also shared she had found some old images of my ex on social media, and could not stop comparing her pregnant body. \n",
      "\n",
      "She feared the baby wouldn’t be an equal to L in my eyes. It worried her when I would ask what she thought the baby would be like that what if the baby was disabled, or didn’t like to do the things we enjoyed as a family, or the baby and L didn’t like each other? She said at one point she found herself wishing I had never had L, so she wouldn’t have to worry as much, and that is when she knew she had to really put in the extra effort to maintain a relationship with L. She feared that between work and L, I wouldn’t have time and wouldn’t bond with the baby like in the articles she read online where fathers didn’t bond with their children until they were able to do things with the family. When I did try and bond with the baby, she worried the baby wouldn’t live up to L. I have never been shy about saying how much being a father means to me, and how raising L has been the highlight of my life (along with marrying my wife, and now having our child together). She said it was initially what made her confident in marrying me, and excited to have a big family with me- but now constantly wondered if her pregnancy and this baby would be a highlight or a burden for me, because the stress is the same but the newness wasn’t, and then what if a newborn and then toddler wouldn’t be as interesting to me as L who is capable of doing activities? She showed me a million articles of different men explaining they didn’t bond with their children until 4+ years old. She also showed me the videos where people say things they did with their first kid, and then get more relaxed as they have more children. She said it freaked her out because it was clear people stopped caring the more children they had. \n",
      "\n",
      "She said that there were times she felt she was ruining our family and coming between me and L. For example, at the zoo she said she cried on the way to the hospital. She was afraid L would hate her and resent the baby for cutting our zoo time short, and that I would be upset that I was spending my time off work at the hospital instead of doing the activities we planned with L. While I work, L and my wife spend a lot of time out of the house (library, local parks, etc).  One of their favorite activities is biking together, and we bike together on weekends as well. We have lots of local trails, but due to her pregnancy she has not been able to. We’ve been doing more indoor activities. My wife said that when I’m at work, L kept saying she hated her because she didn’t get to go on her new bike as often anymore. I said I would discuss it with her, because that is unacceptable. My wife asked me not to since there would be so many changes soon for L, and it hurt her because she missed biking together as well. A couple of months ago, my wife asked me and L if we wanted to read stories together. L chose the first story I read, and my wife chose the second (her favorite childhood story) for me to read to the baby (and L) since it helps promote brain activity and help with bonding. After that, I read another book of Ls choosing. While I was at work the next day, L ripped the pages out of the book my wife chose. She said she was going to tell me, but her friend (same friend who says we aren’t soulmates) said I would think she was making it up and that it seemed to her she was trying to become between me and L. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her why she didn’t tell me any of this, and she explained that she didn’t feel comfortable telling me because her thoughts didn’t even make sense to her- she wanted me to spend time with L so she didn’t feel left out or jealous,and when I did she felt upset I wasn’t spending more time with her. She loves L but wishes we had our first kid together. She wants me around but also feels upset and guilty when I give her/ our unborn baby attention. She said she feared that I would think she was trying to come between me and L, when she wasn’t. By the time I realized something was truly wrong and started to ask what was wrong, if she needed therapy, etc she said she realized she was acting poorly, but didn’t want to admit to herself that she missed out on a lot with me and doubled down as it was hard to face that she made her fears reality by pushing me away and not letting me care- and that she couldn’t “start over”, that her first pregnancy was a somewhat bad experience because of her own actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I realized how terrible I had been. I apologized for making her feel like she couldn’t come to me about anything. She said when she “researched” her feelings she found a bunch of forums were people were calling the poster evil for their feelings about their stepchild, and feared I would feel the same. She said if I had told her I felt about L the way she felt about L, that it would make her angry and upset, so she couldn’t see how I wouldn’t be. We both cried for a long time. I tried to reassure her. I told her how much I loved her, how excited I was, that she was the family of my choosing and my soulmate- that the universe knew that L and I needed her which is why circumstances allowed us to be a family. She apologized for the way she treated me, and said she wanted to make it right. She said she had wanted to apologize when I was beginning to have my meltdown, but was surprised when I yelled, and realized she mightve messed up beyond repair to get that reaction from me. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continued to cry for a long long time, and she asked if I wanted to feel the baby. Of course I said yes, and we cried even more. It turned out to be a great evening, I made us dinner and we laughed about how I was so stressed I went to Reddit for advice. She wanted to read the post and cried again when she did. I reassured her we could move past this, and she said she felt less horrible as she read some of the comments from women in her shoes. It was a bit awkward the first week, after so many months of tension. I knew things were turning around when she woke me up by whispering “baby wants blueberry pancakes” that Saturday. I don’t think I’ve ever prepared pancakes so fast, I couldnt keep the smile off my face. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up going to a pool party a few days later, and she let my choose her swimsuit- a big deal for someone who only wore baggy clothes around me. We took family pictures, and the universe is clearly on my side because on the way home she asked me to feel her belly and our baby was hiccuping- something I had never felt before and it was a first we could share together. She has even let me help her when she is sick without making an excuse about L. I’ve learned that when she comes and puts her back to me and lifts her arm that is my cue to lift her belly up. I now spend a lot of time rubbing and talking to her belly- and rubbing her feet, legs, back, shoulders, hips, haha- she is sore everywhere at this point. The first 500 times it made me cry, it has been such a relief to be involved. I never thought being tasked with acquiring the most random food items at 2am would be a great time for me, but it is. It still sucks that I missed out on a lot. I think it sucks for her too. She gets emotional and says a weight has been lifted off of her and things are so much easier, and she is upset that she didn’t talk to me sooner. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been working to fix some of my wife’s guilt. I realized there was a lot of simple fixes. For example, I was able to go to my local bike shop and get a pull behind trailer. Now, I pull her in that and she can use a small fan and ice packs, and L can ride her bike. I have taken off work so I can spend more time with them both. We are all in therapy and thankfully Ls therapist is continuing to say she is securely attached to both of us, enjoys the time we spend together, is coping very well (some of her behavior was do to another situation, which we have resolved), and she is excited to be a big sister. My wife was terrified that maybe she could sense her attitude shift, but her therapist says that she only has one complaint about my wife- that she forgot her candy one time and then it took 32 whole minutes for the store to deliver it. My wife is in therapy working to overcome the negative feelings she has. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is pretty much were we are now. We are getting very close to baby time and working hard to finish preparing. My wife still needs reassurance. There are a lot of times she brings up my ex and I’ve found bringing up our firsts helps. For example, she will ask about certain things and how it was for me. I’ll say I don’t want to talk about that, and steer the conversation to us. Do you remember our first house? First vacation? First kiss? Date? Remember that time blah blah? It made me fall more in love with you. Do you remember when you and L made me blah? That is still one of my prized possessions. \n",
      "\n",
      "It upsets me that my wife suffered for so long. I believe saying it out loud took a lot of power away from her feelings. I think most people know how badly it feels when you have thoughts that don’t feel like your own when you’re going through a mentally taxing time. I really should’ve stood up for our relationship and her mental health way sooner. I accepted her brushing me off for far too long when I should’ve realized she needed help. I appreciate everyone who reached out or offered advice. I posted this in detail with my wife’s permission- she hopes that it helps someone out there struggling with the same feelings she felt. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My wife was facing insecurity and some mental health issues and did not feel she could reach out to me as they involved my bio daughter. Thankfully, l received great advice from my FIL and you all, and we spoke about it and worked it out. After some awkward times, things are somewhat back to normal and I am able to be involved in my wife’s pregnancy. Everyone, including L, is doing well and excited for the baby to arrive. \n",

      "Title: I (49F) overheard a conversation between my husband (47M) and his sister (43F) about how the reason why my daughter (24F) is so messed up is because I was a bad parent. I don't even know how to proceed after hearing that.\n",
      "Body text: My first husband died when my daughter was only 1 years old. I was left to raise her all alone, although my brother effectively stood in as her father. She had a relatively normal childhood. I was lucky that I did not have to work and that my family stepped in so much to help me raise her. Around her teen years, she started exhibiting some worrying behavior. Lots of aggression, hostility, neuroticism etc. She was very productive and did amazing in school and never got involved in drugs or anything, but her personality changed to become quite cruel and intimidating. I honestly have no idea how it happened or why this change happened with her. She refused any form of counseling or mental health treatment, convinced there was nothing wrong with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate to describe it this way, but the way she treated me and my brother was abusive. She went out of her way to make me feel bad about my weight, my looks, my lack of education, my 'clumsiness' etc on a near daily basis. She would do things to embarrass me in public and clearly take pleasure out of seeing me upset or ashamed. She wasn't just like this to me, she also effectively lost all of her friendships, all of her relations with other family, over her behavior. And it wasn't just teasing, if you frustrated her, she would become terrifyingly angry and even physical and destructive. It was the most harrowing years of my life, to see my own daughter turn into this... cruel, horrible person. The worst part was that she would go back and forth between being kind and sweet to me and acting like she was some amazing person, and then switch into being cruel. I just bit my tongue. I literally was too scared to talk back to her. There was a time where I tried to reign it in but eventually I just couldn't deal with it anymore. She left home at 18 and rarely visits. She lives 500 miles away in New Jersey, working towards a career in finance. When I do see her, she acts fine and friendly, but there are moments where I can see her cruel side is still very much there. I remember when she visited for a whole weekend, and was totally fine, and then at the end she threw a huge fit at me over dinner being made too late in the night and started screaming at me, calling me 'dumb pathetic ugly', breaking her plate on the ground, and then laughed at me when I started to cry. Very classic behavior. It was almost like she had planned to act nice all weekend just to trick me. Anyways, you get the gist. It has been a constant source of pain for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met my husband 5 years ago and married him 3 years ago. My daughter has been nothing but sweet to him when they have met, and so it can be difficult for him to absorb why we are a bit distant. But other family members on my side have assured him what I say is true, so its not as if he doesn't believe me about her problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband had his family over for dinner. We had a fun time, and I went to bed. I could still hear my husband in the living room drunk chatting with his sister, who is basically his best friend. Our house has very thin walls. I heard them discuss my daughter, and... I was just astounded. She brought up how kids dont just 'randomly end up that way' and that there has to have been something to make her that way, and he said how I tell him I was this good parent, but he doesn't really think that is true, because if that were true she wouldn't have ended up that way. He said he isnt sure if I 'abused her or beat her' or something like that. This is paraphrasing heavily, their conversation went on for easily 20-30 minutes. It sounded like they had talked about this before. My husband said that even if I was a horrible parent it means nothing to him because we aren't having kids. He also mentioned how no mother ever admits they are bad parents and that he doesn't think I would ever admit to being one. But he did say that its \"fucked up to mess someone up for life like that and then deny it\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I was just astounded. Just to be clear, I do think something probably triggered her to end up like that. But I spent years trying to get her to open up, go to therapy, anything, and there was nothing. I made her talk to a counselor and she didnt take it seriously at all. I have talked with my husband about those years extensively, I have even told him exactly what his sister said, that I think it came from something, I don't know what. I know my grandmother was a very cruel woman, and maybe it was just a genetic thing passed down, but I can't say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just so deeply hurt by his comments. That he doesn't believe me. I am his wife. We are completely honest with each other. Well, I thought we were. And yet at the same time, I don't blame him. He is completely correct that horrible mothers don't ever admit they are horrible mothers. I know, I have met plenty. And I also do not blame him for ever bringing up these suspicions. Could you imagine telling your wife \"you might have been a horrible abusive mother\"? Basically implying I am lying. Even if he does think that I was, I simply cannot blame him for not ever bringing this up to me. But it doesn't mean I am not deeply, deeply hurt by the fact that he thinks this about me.\n",

      "Body text: I met my boyfriend (“R”) a little over three years ago during our medical schools orientation. We were extremely attracted to each other and almost immediately started dating. We became “roommates” in the middle of our second year (same house but different rooms, though we generally slept together).\n",
      "\n",
      "So here’s the issue. For those who don’t know, after people finish medical school and get their MD, they have to apply to residencies. The MD is a worthless degree without residency. Matching is done via a “match-list”, You interview for spots in specific specialties in specific hospitals all around the U.S, create a list ranking all of your interview positions, give that list to the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter and hope that you get a place high on your list. You essentially have an algorithm go down your match list until you are accepted to a hosptial, where no other positions below that ranking are considered. The caveat is that there is something called a couples-match, which ensures that couples stay together through the match. The downside is that one person ties their success in the match to the success of their partner by doing the couples match.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed from the start that we both wanted to pursue competitive specialties (I want dermatology, he wants ophthalmology), so we crossed off couples-matching to make sure that we would both be as successful as possible in the match. Therefore, we agreed that the end of fourth year would be the end of our relationship if we matched in different cities. We’ve submitted our applications, are submitting our match lists in March, and I am getting second thoughts about not couple’s matching with him. I guess my priorities have changed, because I would rather go to a terrible hospital in the middle of nowhere than lose him.\n",

      "Body text: After I posted I had a deeper conversation with my wife about her friends and expressed my discomfort about being around people that are lusting after my wife and fantasize about having sex with her in front of me. She said she understood how I felt but told me that there was absolutely nothing I should be concerned about. To my wife, her friend and her husband are not serious people. They are fun to be around but that’s it. She experimented with them in her early 20s but she was a different person then. She was very sexually adventurous in college and right after and did a lot of things she’d never think of doing now. She said she’s a 35 year old married mother of 2 with a serious career and she simply isn’t interest in behaving like that anymore. Not to mention that she is happily married and loves me. \n",

      "So I agree and we meet last night at our house. They both apologize and swear to never bring it up again. But I can tell that neither think of this as a big deal and from their tone it seems like they think I am being overly sensitive. So I raise that point and they concede that they do think that I am being “silly”. They tell me that the time they had with my wife was a very memorable experience that they wanted to experience it again and simply asked if my wife would be interested in participating with me or with my approval. They say that they would have been happy to allow me to participate in any way I liked but did admit that their biggest fantasy was to basically double team my wife while I watched. \n",

      "My wife’s friend then says that once I let go of my inhibitions she guarantees that I would enjoy myself. How they think I would enjoy any experience that involves someone else fucking my wife, whether I am actively involved or not is beyond me. I am about to say this when my wife jumps in. She tells them that I will not be enjoying anything. She says she’s not 22 anymore and has babies asleep upstairs. She tells them that neither of us will be fucking anyone else and she thought she made that very clear. \n",

      "It got a little awkward after that and they left shortly after. My wife hugged me when they left and said she was sorry for asking me to talk with them. That was not how she expected that to go. We talked a little more and she admitted that hearing their stories is a fun escape and even got flattered when they would tell her how much they loved being with her. But admitted that it’s become a little too real and she could not stand the thought of watching me with someone else and understands how I feel. So we agreed to take a good long break from seeing them. My wife isn’t going to completely cut her best friend out of her life but we are going to manage how we see them. No more drinking, no more her alone with both of them in their home or ours. Shopping, lunch and similar activities is where she is going to keep the friendship and I can live with that. \n",

      "Title: Divorcing my husband, and it's hard\n",
      "Body text: Last summer my (41F) husband (44M) befriended a woman (33F) on IG who he recognized from the gym. They started chatting and eventually working out together. He mentioned her casually in passing one day said something along the lines of there's a woman at the gym who's been chatting with me. I think you'd like her, you have a lot in common. I'm going to try to set something up with her and her husband. He's an introvert and I thought okay.. I'll believe it when I see it. I didn't hear anything else about her for several months. He works remotely and I work in the office several days a week. One day I had a doc app or something and mentioned that I'd be working from home the next day. He says at dinner, oh remember that woman I mentioned a while back? She and I are going out to lunch tomorrow and but we have a couples date planned in a 2 weeks. 🚩\n",
      "\n",
      "I obviously told him I was not okay with this. He agreed not to go out to lunch with her. But now I have a bunch of questions. He tells me they have all these weird things in common, like so much so that its feels like more than coincidence, and says she looked it up and thinks they're Twin Flames. 🚩🚩🚩 That her husband had expressed concerns with their \"friendship\" and putting in the context of twin flames made him okay with it so he thought it would help me too since I also have guy friends and maybe one of them is a twin flame to me. He said when he looked it up it didn't mean soul mate but just someone who is a catalyst for growth and change in life. 😑 I asked a lot of questions like if he had her number he said no. If they talk outside the gym, he said yes, via social media. Why I hadn't heard anything about this woman for the 4 months he was building this twin flame connection? He didn't realize I needed to know. 🤬 Is he attracted to her? No, he doesnt find her attractive. I had a lot of concerns but he doesn't have a lot of friends, is very introverted and a little socially awkward, so I was willing to give him some grace here. So I told him he needed boundaries with her and to be open and honest with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next 2 weeks I learn a lot of things about this relationship that concern me. Lots of lies of omission, she's VERY much his type physically. And says neither of them are srupid enough to act on anything. 🚩🚩🚩They work out together at different gyms, she's bringing Hygge (deep conversation card games) to the gym to better get to know him, texting him \"Good Morning\" at 4am. They work out together at 430. The messages aren't confirming he's still going to the gym or anything. Just \"Good Morning Sensei\" or something similar, giving him random gifts. Nothing major just first aid kits and stuff. Allegedly he's helping her with nutrition and workouts because she wants to do body building competitions. At this point we are fighting every day about this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "We go on the double date. One the way she texts him because were running late and thats how i learn he does in fact have her numberI meet her and her husband and learn that shes 33, doesn't work and they dont have kids. They seem cool, but I still don't like the situation and the lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue fighting everyday because I feel her behavior is \"girlfriend-ish\" and he's not shutting it down or putting up boundaries. After 6 weeks of fighting everyday and me crying everyday, I check his email and find an email he wrote to himself the day before he told me about the lunch date. It's a list of questions/comments. Asking if she's dreamed about him and whether the dreams were good or bad? Asking to know about her childhood, her siblings, her clothing and shoe sizes. Apologizes/explains trying to screenshot a messenge she had sent him on vanishing messenger. Says he missed her immensely but didn't feel like he could say it over the phone, etc. At this point I decided it was an emotional affair and I was done. I didn't even argue with him, but he cried told me he had recognized the relationship was becoming a problem and had planned to end it but she beat him to it. Her husband told her he was uncomfortable with some of the obsessive behaviors he was seeing and told her he wasnt comfortable with their \"friendship\", never would be issued an ultimatum. So she ended it. We have young children, so I decided to forgive him since it was over. I made him block her nunber and social media, and he promised to go completely no contact with her amd switch gyms. I compromised when he suggested just going to a different location in the gym's feanchise. (I was dumb here because I knew this was a location rhey had previously gone to together, but I figured her spouse would keep her in check) We started Marriage Counseling the week after Thanksgiving. We were supposed to be working on rebuilding the trust and fixing whatever issues made him feel like he needed this woman in his life no matter how much it hurt me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to January, he tells me he went to the old location a couple of times between Xmas and New years, and he ran into them. He mentioned that he was working out at the other location when they asked where he'd been. I was pissed that he told me about this interaction 3 weeks after it happened, but pleased he was being honest with me. A week or so, later he tells me she showed up at the other location. I told him, they weren't to speak or rekindle their \"friendship\" he promised me it would be done and it needed to stay that way. He said okay and he wouldn't talk to her. At some point in January he started refusing to go to marriage counseling, and started putting off all the things we were doing to work on our marriage, he kept saying he was tired because our youngest wasn't sleeping well, and can we do it next week. Around late Feb or March he starts sleeping in the bed with out youngest to help us all get more sleep. I didn't agree with the approach but we were tired. I'm still suspicious and searching his phone, emails, etc. Every chance I get. I'm not finding much aside from a few weird web searches which he deleted from his browser history a few days later. Things like synonyms for a beautiful woman. Different ways to say good morning beautiful. Etc. He had started leaving me little notes in my car and I hoped it was related to that but I also thought it might be a crossword puzzle he was stuck on. Since he swore up and down he wasn't talking to her and wouldn't do that to me. \"He'd learned his lesson.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point my bestie convinces me he had been a socially awkward idiot, and since my snooping hadn't turned up anything. I either needed to forgive him and stop snooping or leave. So I stop snooping. Then a week later my youngest comes down the hall to me after bedtime. I walk him back to his room, and notice my husband snoring. I also notice his phone is lit up with a video or movie playing and isn't on the charger. So I pick up his phone and go to put it on the charger when I see the video is playing on half the screen and under the video is a conversation hes having conversation with her. What's left of the conversation starts with him saying I smell you. Which she responded with either a 😍or ❤️. He then sent her a IG post about how his zodiac sign likes to go down on women, and highlighted a comment about wanting to do it for his own pleasure. We've been together 14 years and I count on 1 hand with fingers to spare the number of times that's happened in our relationship. So i pull out my phone and take a video of the conversation before it vanishes. I take a video of the conversation and send it to her husband on IG. I text my husband that he's a lying piece of shit and we're DONE. He responds \"can you not. Or at least wait until the kids are out of the house\" our kids are YOUNG. That ask means I'm stuck miserable and married to him for at least 14 more years. I tell him he's an asshole.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and I talk the next day and I learn that after seeing him in the gym in December. She reached out to him on MyFitnessPal (MFP) after discovering she was blocked everywhere else, and started going to the gym he was at 2 days a week EVERY week. They would meet in the parking lot, hug each other talk about their workouts and stuff, and then go into the gym workout and not talk. Which my husband felt made him comments about not talking to her in the gym not a lie. 🤬🤬\n",
      " \n",
      "After she reached out on MFP, he inially ignored her message, she followed up claiming she was depressed and losong the will to livr or something without him. He then told her to talk to her husband and see if he could help her. She persisted and eventually he agreed that he missed her and it was unfair that their spouses were dictating their friendships. So they resumed chatting on IG vanishing messenger. He would unblock her chat with her then reblock her so when I checked his phone she'd appeared blocked and like they weren't talking. Her husband told me this. Let's say I found the message on Monday night. Tuesday he \"hid\" from me but went to lunch with her at her favorite restaurant, because \"he didn't want to be found\". Wednesday we talked (read: I yelled and lost my shit at him) Thursday & Friday I had a business trip. Apparent they worked out together on Thursday she cried on his shoulder and Friday they went to lunch at his favorite restaurant on Saturday they meet at Starbucks where she tells him that her husband has requested they take a break for 2 weeks to work on their marriage. At this point, I have meeting scheduled with a divorce attorney because he has shown me where his priorities are.\n",
      "\n",
      "He comes back from that Starbucks meeting PISSED. My husband had told me he was going to meet her and in frustration I messaged her husband like Damn they just can't stay away from each other can they. Her husband interpreted that as my husband continuing to lie to me, and called her fussing. She put him on speaker and my husband was mad that her husband had called him a liar. He hadn't been mad that I called him a pathological liar, and every other term there is for a lying cheating bustard but he was livid that they thought he was a liar. He wanted me to call her husband and explain that I did know in advance and THIS time he had been honest with me. I obviously refused because I didn't give a fuck what they thought of him or us. That made him madder, I have my thoughts on why he was so mad, probably the same thing you're thinking. I learn from her husband that she's poly, which my husband knew all along, and her husband is allegedly coming to terms with being poly. That my husband had actually gone out to lunch with this woman before the outing I vetoed. They've had conversations which she initiated about favorite sexual positions,  likes and dislikes in bed, etc. She allegedly tried to convince my husband to to to NYC with her to a bodybuilding show. Which he said no to (primarily IMO because it wasn't something he could easily lie about)\n",
      "\n",
      "I retained a divorce attorney, we argue. He mostly insists I'm being controlling and I need to be more understanding and accept this \"friendship\". After a week he finally starts apologizing, saying he wants to fix us and can I find us a new marriage counselor. (NO, I cannot) He proceeds to keep telling me I'm being hasty, and I need to give us time to fix this because change won't happen overnight. 2 of my friend convince me that our problems are fixable we just both have to want to work on it. I'm still living in the house but we sleep in different rooms because my name isn't on the mortgage and a few months prior he stopped paying my credit card bill without telling me, and tanked my credit score from 800 to 580. Since I can't comfortably move out right now, and the state requires a few months of separation before they will even process a divorce. So I tell him he has until the ink dries to convince me he's not the callous asshole he's been showing himself to be. I'm waiting until the end of the separation period to file. We've been separated since the end of April when I saw the texts. After weeks of arguing and me telling him there's NO future for us with her in his life, he FINALLY blocked her everywhere, and switched gyms entirely. And other very small changes, we have not seen a marriage counselor, nor has he seen a therapist. I'm planning to move out as soon as I can fix my credit score and find a place to rent in our neighborhood so the kids lives aren't too disrupted. The longer thus goes on the more it feels like too little too late. Overall, I don't feel like he loves me because he chose her EVERY chance he got. It wasn't until her husband reigns her back in that suddenly he care about my pain, is sorry for the hurt he caused, and values our marriage. He went on dates with after he got caught instead of ending it with her trying to work it out with me. I have had to cry and scream for every change he's made, and he's ONLY done exactly what I argued about. It hurts, and I deserve better. I hate what this is going to do to our kids, but I can't stay where I'm not valued. Husband claims I'm blowing it out of proportion. It's an innocent friendship, it was never sexual. The sexual conversations they had were just talking. He's claiming the week of dates was a mental break where he didn't know what else to do or who else to talk to. That I was nagging, overly critical, and controlling where she wasn't she was his escape and thats why he felt the friendship was so important. He thinks we can work through this. I don't think we can. He's 💩 all over every chance I gave him to be honest and to prioritize our relationship. He ignored all my warnings and requests for guardrails on that relationship to stop us from getting here and I don't trust him AT ALL. So I guess I'm looking for different perspectives? Is this something that we can come back from or are we dead in the water?\n",

      "Edit: The friends who said it was fixable said so the 1st week after I found the text. As I've learned more, they've come to agree that he's not invested enough to truly make this fixable.\n",

      "Body text: We’ve been together for 9 years, and married for 4 of them. We have a 2 year old daughter. Throughout the 2 years I can’t get him to help whatsoever. He’s never even changed a diaper, or even put her to bed. I have to do EVERYTHING. I’ve brought it up plenty of times but last week he mentioned wanting to have another kid and I lost my chill. I told him I did not want any more kids just due to the fact that I have to do everything while he gets to do whatever. He told me that having kids is my duty as a woman and that since he is the “provider” he is not supposed to help out at all since he helps out money wise. I would agree to this, expect for the part that I also work 40 hrs a week. I make about 85K a year and he makes around 115K. We have split finances, and we split the bills nearly 50/50. After bringing this up he still said he’s the main provider so it doesn’t matter. I don’t know what to do. He was an amazing boyfriend and a husband but I feel like I’m drowning in my own life everyday. \n",

      "Body text: UPDATE: thanks for all the great advice and suggestions. I ended up speaking to my brother when he called me about something unrelated. I mentioned it to him and that it had bothered me. He initially was surprised and said they share stuff all the time and assumed they were joking about it, but I told him the girls told me later she'd take stuff, tell them she accidentally donated it or threw it out, then wear it, etc and that they were upset about it. He believed it and apologized and said he'd take care of it. Tonight my nieces sent me selfies with all their \"reclaimed goods\". They said she wasn't mad but tried to play it off like she was only taking stuff that \"didn't fit\" or they never wore or used.

I did steal your other one.\" My nieces later told me that she frequently takes the gifts I give them and keeps them for herself. This isn't just borrowing; she'll tell my nieces that the other clothes were lost or she accidentally donated them or something then wear them herself.

      "Body text: My boyfriend and I have been together for over five years and have lived together for 1.5 years now. For context, I was getting ready to go to a Halloween potluck with some of my girlfriends and their respective boyfriends. When I was getting ready, my bf began discussing the idea of a curfew with me, explaining that no woman should be out late because “nothing good happens late into the night” and that I shouldn’t be out til 3am. I explained that I don’t want to be out that long, but the idea of him putting a curfew on me made me uncomfortable. He told me that unless he is physically there with me, I (a female) shouldn’t be out of the house late and at a party. \n",

I go to social events pretty regularly, but rarely go to parties like this (maybe once every 3 months). He was also invited twice to come to this party with me and declined. I asked my bf why he’s saying all this, and he said that, “I have standards. These are my standards. If you don’t like them, you don’t have to live with me anymore. I’m not budging on this.” and then explained that, “Now I expect you home at 1:00 am because you’re pissing me off but I should be saying 11:00 pm.” This freaked me out.

      "A little backstory. I work for my family's business. I have worked for the family business since I was 18 years old, and honestly, it would be great if I didn't have to work with the same people I see on the holidays. My family can be, in a word, toxic. There is a lot of infighting and drama. Working with them is similar to our personal lives, stressful and chaotic. When my grandmother passed away about 3 years ago, I was willed some liquid assets that had belonged to her and my grandfather (gems, jewelry, precious metals, cash etc) and their house they had had since the 60's. And honestly this was a blessing, with that inheritance I finally felt like I could pull free from my family and get out of the family business and take time to go back to school and do something I was passionate about. However, I had no savings at the time, and wanted to get a decent amount saved before I quit. At this time an opportunity opened up at work, the pay was way higher, but required 4-7 months of travel time a year. I talked it over with my BF and we decided that we only needed 2 years to save up what we needed. I took the job and prepared to leave for 2 months for training at the main branch. \n",

I was concerned about our financial goals because of this, but he swore up and down that he would get a new one shortly and that he wouldn't need any help with his personal bills. Well a year went by and he had only taken up gig work and temp jobs. I wasn't happy as I was having to travel all the time and was having to be really frugal in order to get all our joint bills paid while also putting money into savings. He was managing to pay his own bills, so I let it slide since he tossed in what he could to the joint pile as well. Now I'm sitting here, about to complete my two years and my BF has decided to come clean to me.\n",

And he tells me last week that he has been paying his personal bills by selling the things my grandparents had willed me that I had left in a safe that was hidden in the house. A safe he only had access to because the hunting rifle is in there, and I thought, y'know he wouldn't do that to me. \n",

And now I have so much less than I thought I did. He only told me because he had figured a way to pay me back and had gotten a stable job and was planning on using most of his paycheck to give to me until I was made whole. But this, just honestly disgusts me. I feel so violated. More than that, I wonder if this his go to pattern now. Life is stressful, a lot of change is happening, and he just self destructs? \n",

I look at him and just feel nothing right now.  It's breaking my heart because I really care for him, and yet I just can't see anything changing. I feel so conflicted, we have been together so long and even have all the same friends and share a life together.  Will we be able to come back from this? Or, is this what falling out of love feels like?\n",

      "Title: I (27F) found out that my husband (28M) has been hiding a female coworker for over 6 months. \n",
      "Body text: Backstory— This is kind of a long story but I’m feeling so confused and lost. I’m 27 and my husband is 28. We’ve been married for almost 2 years, but I’ve known him for 11 years. Our relationship has always been a little rocky but it definitely seemed to get worse after I got pregnant and had our son (he’s 1 now). My husband has been working at his job for a year now give or take—he’s a mechanic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s where the long story comes in lol. My 1 year old got ahold of his eye drops we’ve been using and put them in his mouth. I was unsure if any of the eyedrops got into his mouth or if he ingested any so I immediately called poison control freaking out. After the call, I texted my husband saying that I was about to have a panic attack but I was scared to tell him why (I was scared that he would be mad at me for my toddler getting into the eye drops). My husband immediately texts back and says “I’m not cheating on you. She’s just a coworker that gets me weed”. I’m of course confused and wondering what he’s fessing up about? So I press more into him and everything unraveled. He confesses to me that he’s become friends with his coworker who is a woman and that she gets him weed and he buys her snacks/lunch sometimes. He says the only time they text is if it’s about weed or work related issues. But he told me he has been deleting all of their texts for over 6 months now but he’s not hiding anything. I’m immediately suspicious of him because if there was nothing to hide, he wouldn’t have to delete any texts. So we keep talking and he says that she’s just a friend, he’s not interested in her, and he’s not attracted to her. But then tells me that he didn’t want to tell me about her because he knew I’d be insecure (because she’s pretty and his type). He says they slowly became friends over the past several months and that she knows about me and our child. \n",
      "\n",
      "He kept telling me that he’s not cheating on me but he knows that he shouldn’t have hid her or the texts for over 6 months. He kept telling me to text her and get her side of the story. At first, I immediately said no but then I kept ruminating on it. So I did text her and asked if she had any screenshots of their texts she could share with me. She called me and said that she also has deleted all of the messages with my husband because she doesn’t like clutter in her phone and frequently deletes messages. She said I have nothing to worry about. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess I’m just wondering, do you think both of them are lying about nothing going on?\n",

      "UPDATE: Husband and I hashed it out this evening. He confessed that he’s been having an emotional affair and it’s been more than just weed and getting her lunch. He said that they have talked about our marriage problems, he’s told her things about me, and vice versa where she’s talked about relationship problems to him (she’s not dating anyone at the moment though). He said that they have talked about animals, hobbies, interests, tv shows, etc. He said they have similar personalities and a lot in common. He said he thinks she’s pretty but he’s not “attracted” to her and isn’t interested. Said he’s just been enjoying the attention, her stroking his ego, and the validation he’s gotten. He told me that he had no plans of telling me so this either would have went on much longer or it would have went on until he got another job. I told him we’re done and there is no going back from this. I told him that when I’m able to, I’m divorcing him and he understood. Thank you all for commenting and telling me the obvious. I was just hoping maybe I was wrong. Delusion is one hell of a drug. 😂 \n",

      "I 29F sat my 30M boyfriend Of 1.5 years down today to have one final talk about him being a lazy slob. Half eaten food and dirty dishes on his desk for days, empty soda cans everywhere, food wasted from being left out overnight. Today I found old chocolate milk spilled down the wall behind his desk and on his footrest. Tried to work with him, he just won't keep up with himself, it's been a year of this. Talked to him today, laid it out, had a very civil talk with him. And then he hit me with \"I guess now is a good time to tell you that I don't love you anymore\". I asked him how long he felt like this, he said he's known for about a month. Guess what happened a month ago? We signed another year lease. Yep, this asshole knew he didn't want to stay with me, and still signed a year lease with me. Needless to say our relationship ended today, with 11 months left on our one bedroom apartment lease. Almost 15 years of friendship. \n",

      "I called my mom and sobbed of course, talked for a bit. Now I'm back home. I told him he could have the living area, I would move my stuff into the bedroom, and his stuff into the living area. I bought the bed before we got together, keeping that. We don't have a couch. He works overnights and leaves for work in a few hours. I'm thinking of moving all his stuff, buying him an air mattress (more than he deserves, I know, but no couch) and buying a lock for the bedroom just to really solidify boundaries, it'll be done before he gets home. I'm not trying to be petty, I'm not gonna break his stuff or throw anything away. As I'm moving his stuff out of the bedroom I'm vacuuming and throwing away his trash.

      "Title: My daughter's friend (both 12y/o) stole her expensive pants - not sure how to handle the situation\n",
      "Body text: **Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been family friends with the Smiths\\* for about 4 years now. We have kids at ages that mesh up perfectly, so it's always a good time when we get together. They're great people that we trust. They have a daughter we'll call Carol and we have one we'll call Laura, both 12 years old. Laura is a bit shy but the kind of girl who opens up and has a great time with a best friend, which Carol is. Laura is also very organized and clean. She knows where all her stuff is and it's exceptionally rare that she misplaces anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Incident**\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks ago, we had Carol over to swim with Laura in our pool. Before they went in the pool, Carol and Laura were in Laura's room. At some point, Carol started looking in Laura's dresser, apparently just browsing. Laura was a little weirded out by this but didn't think too much of it. Carol at one point says, \"Wow, these are nice lululemon pants!\" Laura had gotten them about a week prior as a special going back to school/birthday gift, and they cost about $100. She was very excited about them. So they talked about them briefly, then Carol put them back. The girls then went out and swam for a while, then came back inside and changed. Carol left her bag in Laura's room while they hung out for another hour or so. When it was time to go, Carol went and got her bag from Laura's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Laura was absolutely freaking out before school because she couldn't find her pants. She looked in every drawer, looked in her sister's drawers, looked through her dirty clothes, the laundry room - everywhere. The pants were nowhere to be found. We certainly didn't want to assume the worst of Carol, but somewhat related, Laura did mention that Carol was wearing a different friend's crocs which she said she had \"borrowed\" from said friend. So my wife and I decided my wife would call Carol's mom and do the old benefit-of-the-doubt conversation, asking gently if maybe Carol had mixed up Laura's pants with her stuff. Carol's mom said she asked Carol about it but Carol said she didn't have the pants. So we went back to a theory of they were misplaced. But several weeks passed and we still didn't see them. Again, very unlike Laura for something like this to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Awkward**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday at school, Laura sees Carol wearing what suspiciously looks like her lululemon pants. She notices the logo on them on the lower back, the pocketless design that her pants had, the same color, etc. She's pretty sure they're hers, especially considering the implication in Carol's first reaction to them that she herself didn't have pants like that. She asked Carol about the pants, mentioning they looked a lot like hers. Carol seemed uncomfortable and it seemed like she was trying to hide the logo on them. At one point, Carol lagged behind the group of friends they were in and it seemed like she was trying to fold the top of the pants down so the logo was less visible. Laura had previously told another friend named Sarah about this incident, so Sarah was on close watch at this point too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the day, Carol, Laura, and Sarah were in class together and Sarah observed that the logo had been cut out of the pants, which was definitely done since they had seen her hours earlier. Laura had a look and saw the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I discussed it at length and decided that even if this creates an awkward wedge between our families, we will call again and mention what Laura witnessed. So my wife calls Carol's mom, who at the time was in the middle of a school-related event, so when my wife explained the situation, the response was, \"Huh, ok, I will check later tonight and get back to you.\" It seemed a little more casual than she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today at school, Carol seemed the same as usual, like nothing had happened. No mention of the pants, no mention of her mother talking to her about it, nothing. Laura, being the non-confrontational person she is, didn't say anything about it either. We have not heard from Carol's mother either and it has been over 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Now What?**\n",
      "\n",
      "So now we're not totally sure what to do. Do we wait another day or two? Do we call a 3rd time and up the rhetoric a bit? My wife hasn't used the word \"stolen\" yet but that's only because we thought the hint so to speak was obvious enough that she would at least tell Carol, \"You need to give those back.\" Do we just let it go at this point and cut our losses? We had already set up a date to have their family over this Friday for dinner, so now we're kind of dreading that, because if we don't say something between now and then and they don't say anything to us, we're going to have that in the back of our minds the whole time and not be super thrilled about it. Not to mention, we can't trust Carol in our house because who knows what she has her eyes on next? What's the best thing to do here?\n",

It wasn’t a surprise so my fiancé and I both invited who we wanted and one of the people I wanted there was one of my former managers at work, let’s call him Tom. I am a CPA at a big firm and Tom was really a mentor to me when I started. He left to work in industry but we kept in touch and are still close. Tom is 40 and just the nicest guy you will ever meet.\n",

      "I was wrong. A few weeks later Tom calls me and tells me that his wife had been acting strange since the engagement party and he went through her phone and found text messages with another guy.

Tom had confronted his wife the night before and of course it was my friend who she’d slept with.\n",

My friend hit on my fiancé before we met and she shot him down abruptly then. I’m not worried  about her. But I am sick over Tom and I do bear responsibility for what happened. \n",

      "**UPDATE:** As many of you have suggested I sat him down and had a conversation with him. I asked him how he felt about our relationship, about the issues he had previously brought up etc. (Many of you have asked what the \"issues\" were and I mentioned it in a comment below. I was 7 months in to a high risk pregnancy, tired, stressed out, and working overtime to help save for our downpayment/house hunting when this conversation happened. I was unpleasant to be around and fighting with him over little things and he felt unhappy with me. We closed on our house, I gave birth to our daughter, and went on my maternity leave and the fighting ended naturally. It was very much temporary issues during a stressful time in my life when I had a lot of pressure as I was handling most of the preparation for our new home/family on my own as he has a high stress job.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told that he couldn't compare before and now accurately because I was always busy with our daughter and school now so he doesn't think it's a \"fair\" comparison. I pointed out that while yes, I am busy, I don't see why that makes a difference as I'm balancing the stress of our family and my school well and not letting it affect me or my mood negatively. In the end he said we have new problems now. He couldn't quite put his finger on what they were apparently but that he was unhappy and would \"let me know\" when I did something that bothered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I wanted to put it all out on the table because I don't want to make any assumptions so I asked him directly if he wanted to marry me and he said it wasn't the time to be having that discussion and ended the conversation almost immediately after. I mentioned our previous conversation/timeline to him and the second I mentioned marriage he tensed up and told me he doesn't recall our conversation at all. So that's that I guess. (For those who were asking I wanted a simple courthouse wedding, nothing big or fancy. So finances were not a factor.)\n",

      "Some people have suggested counseling, I don't see the point in continuing to invest my time and money in a relationship that is leading nowhere and am not interested in convincing him to marry me.

I am very disappointed but also glad that I have clarity on the situation as it has been extremely stressful and distracting. I am planning on leaving and need to figure out exactly what that looks like and how it will work.\n",

      "Title: I (38F) shot an adult scene when I was 18. My husband (40M) doesn’t know and I just found the video again on the internet. Should I tell him?\n",
      "Body text: Twenty years ago when I was 18 years old I shot an adult scene (porn). I didn’t intend to shoot the scene, I was going with my friend for support and when she chickened out at the last minute I stepped in and did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I regretted it immediately after and regretted it even more when I saw it on the internet. The video which was about 30 minutes long made its way around, mostly being shared on file sharing servers. This was post Napster so there were a lot of knockoffs at the time. But after a while the video seemed to disappear and nobody I knew ever found out about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I met my husband a few years after I shot that scene and I never told him. I was ashamed and prayed that he would never find out. He never did and we’ve been married for 15 years and have two children together. He is the love of my life and he satisfies me in every way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I check frequently for that video that I made and unfortunately last week I found it again on an adult site. It’s one of the more popular sites and I am now terrified that someone will find it. It could be someone that my husband works with or a friend of my daughters. I’m just terrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is, should I finally come clean and tell my husband? I know that he won’t leave me if I do. He knows I was rather promiscuous before I met him and he’s been ok with all of the crazy things I did before him. But this is the one thing I never told him. It’s the thing I am most ashamed of and I don’t want him to ever see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is what is preventing me from telling him, because I don’t want him to see it. There are many reason for this, the biggest for me is that I don’t want my husband to feel insecure. The man I shot that scene with had a very large penis and I made kind of a big deal about it when I shot the scene. My husband is a little above average in that area but he isn’t close to that guy, but none of the other guys I have even been with were either. I’ve had the best sex of my life with my husband and that’s the truth. But I still feel like he may lose his confidence if he sees that video.\n",

      "Title: I [32M] love my wife [30F] as a person, but she's completely dependent on me and I can no longer handle her as a spouse\n",
      "Body text: I am going to try my best to describe this situation, but I feel like I'm having trouble organizing it.  Please ask clarifying questions if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been married to my wife for 8 years.  We've always gotten along spectacularly from a social standpoint.  Unfortunately, she came from a difficult home life, with two abusive parents who she was still living with when we met.  She moved in with me after about 8 months of dating, partially just to escape what she was enduring.  But that was fine - I was starting out a career after college, and having the company was really meaningful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "During these first few months, we tried to take steps to get her help and move past her trauma.  She started therapy and we tried to get her on anxiety meds.  At the same time, she was still depending on her parents for medical insurance and her parents began to \"forget\" to provide her meds as a form of control (including important things like inhalers for her asthma).  Due to the trauma and being far behind on life experience due to her parents, she was in no state to work, so we made the decision to get married much earlier than planned so she could be on my health insurance.  It was a small courthouse ceremony, which we were fine with.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued getting her care, but I noticed that things never changed.  She would have days where she just felt so off that she couldn't get out of bed.  Other days, she's stuck in the bathroom all day.  Her sleep schedule drifted all over the place.  We would try to go out and do things and she'd have to back out because she felt sick.  There was always something standing in the way of her becoming a functional member of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "We kept looking into these problems.  Now that she had reliable medical care, she continued to be diagnosed with more and more chronic conditions: as of writing she has been found to have CPTSD, depression, ADHD, PCOS, IBS, AERD, asthma and psoriasis.  The list just kept growing, and it seemed like getting her into a functional state was just impossible.  But she was finding out what was wrong, and attempting treatment.  That was good.  I was willing to be patient with her and help her get better.  I've always made enough money to support both of us.  Overall we live very comfortably.  We hoped to work through the issues, live a quiet life for now, and eventually have more adventures when her conditions were managed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But here we are 8 years later and things look almost exactly the same.  Basically her whole life is within the bounds of the house.  She gets up at whatever random hour she wakes up, lays in bed for a while watching videos on her phone, moves to the living room and either plays video games on her computer or lays on the couch and watches Youtube on the TV or reads things online on her phone.  When I'm out there, we'll hang out and talk.  Sometimes we play games or watch videos together.  She'll move between the couch and computer a few times.  Sometimes she's on a voice call with some friends.  Then the day's over whenever she feels tired or sick and she goes back to bed.  That's it - every single day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wears the same outfits for days at a time (when she bothers to wear clothes), and showers once a month at most.  I've tried to encourage her to take more but she claims that it takes so much energy out of her to do so and that \"you're not supposed to shower every day anyway\".  Sometimes the burden on her does seem to be true, where she's struggling afterwards due to the heat or whatnot, but I think she doesn't give herself enough credit either.  She definitely was a lot better at the beginning with that - maybe not every day, but most days.  Needless to say, she tends to have a stench.  Of course, if someone is visiting she is able to force herself to take a shower, or uses enough dry shampoo to cover the smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "She doesn't do chores around the house, even when I have split them up with her and given specific, simple tasks.  For instance, I gave her something small like emptying the garbage cans in the bathrooms when they get full.  Instead she just lets them overflow and claims she forgot.  Or maybe crushing pop cans for recycling - oh... she's too tired to do that.  The only place she cleans is her desk, and only when company is visiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way I interpret her failure to do things, it's like she has become ridiculously risk averse - if there is even the slight possibility she won't be able to complete something, she won't start it.  And when she does start it, that fear of not finishing makes her sick and then fulfills the prophecy.  So she keeps doing less and less and never wants to expand her horizons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to do things outside the house with her is like pulling teeth.  Medical appointments, she's fine with... but dinner dates?  Best we can do is cheap fast food, and she will probably want to leave as quickly as possible if she's even up to going there in the first place.  Usually, she'd rather I just pick it up in the drive through and bring it home.  Visiting family for holidays is a nightmare.  She's always looking for an excuse not to go, and if we're there I have to keep an eye on her the whole time to make sure she is okay.  She'll constantly text me asking when we're going to leave.  So I end up cutting things short.  I have better family visits when I just go on my own, but then everyone asks why she isn't there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the event, though, I have to prepare her days in advance.  Constant reminders, trying to force her to realign her sleep schedule (and waking her up for things - she refuses to use alarms), making sure she showers.  I can't even get her to take walks - it's too hot, it's too cold, too many bugs, too sunny, you name it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've asked her before, what happened to our plans from before?  But now she says she \"isn't really all that interested\" in going out and doing things now.  Neither of us are social butterflies but based on how we talked in the early days, I thought she'd at least want to go on trips with just the two of us.  You know, see some museums, some natural wonders, silly tourist traps, that kind of thing.  Or on a less significant note, just going to local events.  I like having those special moments and sharing them - not all the time, but enough to be significant.  Instead, now my life starts to mirror hers.  I'm always at home, don't go out, just doing crap on the computer all day.  Doing things on my own is an option, and I have, but the sharing of it is a big part of the enjoyment to me.  I only have a few local friends, having moved to this area as an adult for work, and a lot of times they aren't able to do these things with me because, as we get into our 30s, it's stuff they'd rather do with their own partner and/or kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, as long as we're just at home hanging out, having fun, and talking to each other, everything is great, and because we're home a lot it ends up masking some of the issues.  We get along so well in that respect and have a deep comfort with each other to just be ourselves, warts and all.  We very rarely argue, she is never mean to me, and always thankful for what I do.  She always seems well intentioned and while I'm not the best at reading people, she always appears genuine to me.  But I can no longer envision us doing anything more than being at home.  No trips.  No special events.  No accomplishing things together.  Hell, I can barely even picture us cooking dinner together.  Whether it actually is her health, or trauma, or just some kind of internal unwillingness to grow, it's apparent that she isn't growing with me and probably never will.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I have unintentionally enabled her this whole time.  It has been the path of least resistance as I navigate the challenges of life and my own personal struggles.  I haven't been able to decisively put my foot down - every time I do I end up backing off.  When I have tried to have discussions about this, it always ends the same way.  She starts sobbing, claims she's \"trying \\[her\\] best\" and goes mute for days.  So of course I stop trying to fight her - what's the point, I already know how it's going to end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, there's a mental health component here.  Maybe the trauma really did break something inside her.  Unfortunately, she seems resistant to treatment.  Not as in she won't get treatment - but that none of the treatments are doing anything.  She's been trying different medications for years now with nothing making her budge, with the exception of finally eliminating most of her trauma nightmares (that's a good thing, of course!).  She goes to therapy, but that doesn't seem to help either.  In fact, once the therapist said that she didn't think she could make any more progress because my wife wasn't taking any action.  That stopped the therapy for a while, but she has recently started going back.  I'm still not seeing any action coming out of it.  I wanted her to try EMDR therapy for her CPTSD, but she thinks it's pseudoscience despite reading plenty of research showing it works.  I can't force her to, she's an adult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, I noticed my own executive function declining and sought help.  During that time I did a lot of introspection as well.  I suddenly realized just how messed up this all was.  I tried to tell her that I had long term doubts unless we could turn this all around.  It ended exactly as described above.  We ended up trying couples therapy, which brought many good ideas to the table and reminded us of the idea of compromise.  Maybe I can't get everything I want, but she can rise a bit to meet me in the middle.  We tried to better divide chores, try to commit to doing things more often... trying to get her to shower even just once a week.  She ended up reneging on every single thing.  I began to lose the urge to fight again, but the thoughts keep dwelling in my head.  I know that this situation isn't right and isn't what I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've watched my 20s slip away from me with very little to show for it except working day in and day out.  My 30s are starting to look the same, and if that happens, the rest of my life will likely follow the same pattern.  As we get older, I will probably have to care more and more for her, beyond the usual aging concerns, and it will get harder for me.  Is she doing this maliciously?  Taking advantage of my hospitality?  Or, is it just that her mental health is that bad?  If she only actually loves me for being a meal ticket, she sure does a good job acting.  But at the same time, her actions don't match up to her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel backed into a corner with two options.  1) Keep the status quo and keep slowly trying to help her, as I keep shedding years off my life.  Or, 2) Divorce her, free myself of the burden, and try to start over.  Which sounds \"simple\" enough, but I will likely still carry a great burden - I know she believes there are no options for her outside of this marriage.  She's said before in passing that if it ends (for instance, if I get in an accident and die), she's killing herself, no ifs ands or buts.  I know this is a classic sign of an abusive partner.  I also know that she probably isn't bluffing.  She made attempts before as a teenager, before I met her.  Can I risk that?  I don't want her to die.  And I know that if it's a direct result of my desires, that I will always consider myself responsible.  To me, it would effectively be making a statement that I considered my life to be worth more than hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's also technically right that there's nowhere else to go.  She has no college education, no work experience, no driver's license, no credit history, no local friends, no family she interacts with, and basically no exposure to \"adulting\" so to speak.  There's no other support network than what I provide.  If I leave, and she does stay alive, she has few options.  She can't even go back to her parents - not only are we estranged from them, but I understand that they are now both hospitalized and nearing end of life due to poor lifestyle choices.  I've tried to build a safety net for her just in case, but she just has no interest in it.  Driving - \"I don't have anywhere to go\" or \"I think I'll get distracted and crash, it's too dangerous\".  School, she just refuses to ever go back, says she can't bear to do it again.  There's an excuse for everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came into this leveraging my good position in life to help someone I loved who was in need, but at this point it just feels like my gifts were squandered, maliciously or not.  I set myself on fire to keep her warm, but my wick is just about burned out.  As a friend said, it's like I am taking care of a child.  I still love her, but less as a partner and more as just someone close to me, like a family member (yes, I know a spouse is technically a family member - you know what I mean).  The romance is gone and I can't see her as an equal like this.  If she got better, would the feelings come back?  Maybe, but my hopes are so low they might as well not exist.\n",

      "TL;DR: My wife has many illnesses and uses them as an excuse to basically be a NEET and just sit around all day. I think she can do better, but no longer has the willpower to.  I realized I want more in life, but I'm worried if I leave her she will just kill herself.\n",
