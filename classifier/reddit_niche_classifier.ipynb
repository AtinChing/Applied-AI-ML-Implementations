    "### Scraping Data\n",
    "We need to get some reddit posts.\n",
    "We can choose between top or hot.\n",
    "This issue isn't inherently an AI/ML issue, but more of a data issue. The reason I am mentioning this issue is because its extremely relevant to what we're doing (since it directly involves our source of data). \n",
    "You are likely to run into data issues like this and need to be ready to make decisions like this yourself too.\n",
    "#### Hot\n",
    "- Hot is very good up-to-minute viral content, but due to Reddit API limitations (**not** PRAW limitations), hot can only return upto 1000 posts. And for certain subreddits, such as r/relationships, it returns much fewer posts than 1000 posts sometimes, like 200-400. \n",
    "- You can overcome this by scraping from multiple subreddits to maximise total subreddit amount count.\n",
    "#### Top\n",
    "- Top gets more sustainably viral content, content that isn't necessarily likely to be up-to-the-minute, but will still hit and is more likely to achieve steady virality.\n",
    "- It returns a lot more posts in general from single queries (not likely to only get 200-400 posts) due to how Reddit differs in its way of calculating whether a post is considered \"top\" vs \"hot\".\n",
    "- It also allows you to use time_filters (like day, week, month, year), which essentially refers to the date range among which you want to scan/look for top rated posts. \n",
    "    - You do not have this option with the hot option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Verdict\n",
    "- I am going to go with top, as the usage of time_filters allows us to retrieve so many more posts than hot, and also allows us to prioritize subreddits that I would consider more relevant.\n",
    "- You are free to use either option, as I will write a function for both.\n"

The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**\n\nAskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.\n\nThis is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.\n\n\\-The AskReddit mods",

         "We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \\_\\_\\_\\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a \"shower thought\" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.\n* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe Ass Credit Mods",

         "Good people, I need some help.\n\nMy husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.  \n\nThe last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights.\n\nLast month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.\n\nThis is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.\n\nI'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.\n\nTLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?",

I am (F17) and he is (M20) We have been together for a year now and he has always had this problem, I’ve told him that he should to fix it and that I’d help him with it, but he doesn’t do anything to improve it.\n\nThis whole year he has given me empty promises about fixing it and I’ve really gotten tired of those “promises”. (he is basically gaming all night for those who wants to know)\n\nHe wakes up at around 18 or 19 in the night (6pm and 7pm) or maybe even later. I want to spend time with him but he’s not willing to fix his sleep to do that.\n\nEvery time I bring the subject up with him, he gets very upset and says bad things to himself, and says that he just always forgets the time when he’s playing.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he’s very moody and can get angry easily throughout the days.\n\nThere are times where I made him go to sleep “early”with me (probably at 3am) and woke up early aswell, where he told me that he actually felt a lot better doing that, so I just simply don’t understand why he keeps going to bed so late.\n\nI have suggested to him MULTIPLE times that he should set an alarm for when he’s supposed to sleep and he says it’s a good idea, so I tell him to set the alarm like right now so he doesn’t forget and he just dismisses it because he doesn’t feel like doing it.\n\nI really need some advice because I want to spend my time with my boyfriend, and this has only gotten so much worse throughout the year. I love him so much and I just want the best for him.\n\nTL;DR;\nHe goes to bed super late and wakes up at around 18 or later and I really miss the quality time with him. He doesn’t do anything to fix it and only dismisses my suggestions when I try to help him fix it.",

         "Hi everyone,\nI’m a 30F and have been with my partner (32M) for almost 8 years. He’s my first serious partner, and we’ve built a life together. Our relationship is stable, secure, and loving, we laugh a lot, support each other, and I truly love him.\n\nBut lately, I’ve been feeling a kind of sadness over never experiencing that new love feeling again. The butterflies, the nervousness, the excitement of getting to know someone new and seeing where it goes. I miss that feeling, and sometimes it makes me feel a bit trapped and sad, even though I want to be with him.\n\nIt’s not about having met someone else or wanting to leave him. It’s more like a nostalgic longing for something I know I can’t get back without losing what we’ve built.\n\nI feel guilty even having these thoughts. It feels taboo to talk about, like I’m ungrateful. But I wonder if others have felt this way in long-term relationships, especially if they didn’t have much experience before.\n\nIs it possible to recreate the sense of curiosity and excitement in a long-term relationship? How do you deal with longing for something so tied to the new, without wanting to lose what you have?\n\nI’d appreciate any thoughts, especially from those who’ve been in similar situations.\n\nTL;DR: I love my partner deeply and have been with him for almost 8 years (he’s my first serious relationship). But I miss the feeling of being newly in love ",

         "Tldr: after 26 years if she was herself she wouldn't be with me or around her parents. See question at bottom \n\n\nWe have had marriage issues, mostly related to her family, and they have become worse recently. We are both in individual counseling and just started couples counseling. \nFamily enmeshment and narcissism from her parents and brother has been noted and she is working through some strong emotional abuse that seems to be projected at me lately. \n\nI feel bad for her, but I keep getting hurt. Today, she said she can't be herself and I said I know that has been an issue since childhood and want her to be herself. \n\nThen, she said if she was herself she wouldnt be around her parents or with me. That kinda stung. Is that a somewhat common type of comment when someone is recovering from emotional abuse and processing many emotions or did I just waste 26 years with someone that doesn't want to be with me?",

         "[35M] Found concerning texts between my girlfriend [33F] and her male friend, not sure what to believe",
         "I (35M) recently discovered some text messages between my girlfriend (33F) and her male friend that have left me questioning our relationship. We’ve been together for 3 years.\n\nThe messages I found showed her texting “I love you” to him. When he asked “did you feel anything?” she replied “yes, it’s always whenever I am with you…”\n\nWhen I confronted her about these texts, she became angry that I had checked her phone. She claimed this is just a friendship that has lasted 25 years and that saying “I love you” to each other is normal for them.\n\nI’m having trouble processing this. These messages keep replaying in my mind and sometimes I just go completely blank thinking about them. When I try to discuss this with her further, she dismisses my concerns and tells me I need to “get rid of this thought” that she’s involved with someone else.\n\nI want to trust her, but these messages and her defensive reaction are making it difficult. There have been a few other things happening recently that are breaking my trust, though I’m trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? Is it normal to say “I love you” and discuss “feeling something” with a friend of the opposite sex? Am I overreacting, or are these legitimate red flags? How should I approach this conversation in a way that doesn’t make her defensive?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: Found messages between my GF and her male friend saying “I love you” and discussing feelings. She claims they’re just friends of 25 years. I’m having trouble trusting her explanation, especially with her defensive reaction.",

         "I (F/29) don’t like my boyfriend’s (M/27) dog and I feel taken for granted because he keeps having me babysit.",
         "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n\nFor context:\n\n* This is both of our first time living with a significant other.\n* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n\nBefore moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n\nAt the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nAbout the dog:\n\n* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n\nFast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n\nAfter 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n\n**How should I approach this conversation with him?**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMoved in with my boyfriend (M/27) last year. Despite agreeing to hold off on getting a dog, he pressured me into it a month later. He travels a lot, and I end up being the sole caretaker for both his anxious herding dog and my own lower maintenance dog. After 10 days of solo dog duty, I’ve hit a breaking point. I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.",

      "My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling.

      "The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time.

      "Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride.

I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.\n",

      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we moved in together last July. Weeks after signing our lease in June, he surprised me by putting down a deposit for a dog, specifically, a herding breed, despite us living in an 800 sq ft apartment in a busy, loud part of the city. I was completely caught off guard because I didn’t expect him to get a dog so soon after moving in together.\n",

      "* I’d been living alone for 4 years prior.\n",
      "* I already have a 3-year-old toy dog who fits well with my city lifestyle. She’s low-maintenance, and I’ve never made my boyfriend feel responsible for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before moving in, I made it clear I didn’t want another dog yet. I wanted us to settle into living together first, especially since we had international trips planned that summer, and my boyfriend travels frequently for work, sometimes for a week at a time, often monthly. I knew I’d likely end up being the one taking care of the new dog while he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, we agreed he wouldn’t get a dog *for now*. But about two months after moving in, he brought up losing the dog deposit and made me feel pressured to say yes. I reluctantly agreed.\n",

      "About the dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "* She’s a herding dog from an Amish breeder and extremely anxious.\n",
      "* She was recently prescribed anxiety medication, though I honestly think her environment is part of the problem.\n",
      "* My boyfriend initially said he wanted a dog to be more active, but I haven’t seen much change there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now (May 2025). I’m neutral about his dog... I don’t love her, but I take care of her alongside my own. My boyfriend recently left for a work trip for a week, came home for a few days, then got pressured by his family into another 5 day trip abroad. I was invited, but I stayed behind because of work and law school expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 days of solo dog-parenting both dogs, I hit a breaking point. I cannot keep doing this. It’s not the first time this has happened since we moved in together, but I think I finally snapped because 10 days was just too much. I don’t necessarily want him to rehome his dog, but I do need more support. Whether it’s hiring a dog walker, arranging a regular sitter, or something else, it’s time to set some clear boundaries.\n",

I don’t want him to get rid of the dog but need to set clear boundaries and ask for more support (dog walker/sitter). Looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.\n",

We had a great time making out, was talking dirty to her, using my hands i think she finished im not sure or was very close too, her legs were shaking like crazy and he was getting loud. then she started to go down on me. during that whole like 30min session of foreplay i was hard the whole time. then we both agreed to have sex. as soon as i’m about to put it in i get soft. I felt bad but she was understanding. but i felt really bad, i was up for 24 hours and i had some drinks in me. so maybe that’s why. in past relationships i never had this problem, accept for the first time with my ex but it was smooth sailing ever since. so im worried about our next time happening probably this week so i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how i could stay hard. i didnt feel nervous or anything but i guess my body did. now i feel like theres more pressure on me for next time.\n",

Almost every argument starts with him accusing me of being upset and me being confused. I try to nicely defuse the situation and try and reassure him that Im not upset but it never works he’s so convinced that Im upset that he gets into yelling at me over it. Anything i say makes it worse and worse. So I shut down and stop talking. I curl up into a ball and cry most the time. He says I’m being a “bully” when I don’t talk to him because that hurts him emotionally…When I try and tell him that these things he’s saying and the way he’s yelling at me negatively effects me he accuses me of insulting him. Anything I try and communicate with him that he’s being mean to me it’s “how dare you say I’m mean! You’re actually the mean one for saying that” Then says something worse right back. He tells me to just “break up with him” in these arguments and says he wants to die etc. I can’t even get in a car with him when he’s mad at me because there has been multiple times where he endangers my life over him thinking I was upset when I said I wasn’t. Slamming his breaks in the middle of the freeway for no reason, driving fast and close to cars nearly hitting them. Why don’t you just leave? you may ask. I’m stuck and I won’t go into many details incase he sees this he will know it’s me. \n",

      "Body text: I (26F) and my boyfriend(27M) have been together for the past two years. We’ve known each other since we were kids and even dated briefly in high school, but it didn’t work out back then. A few years ago, we reconnected and started dating again, and since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been.\n",

      "Just a few days ago, we had a big fight because a male colleague added me on social media and I accepted the request. This turned into a huge argument and as always, he started crying and said he’ll never change, and that if I can’t deal with it, I should leave. In a fit of anger, I told him I wanted to end the relationship. We haven’t spoken since, but I know either he’ll come back or I’ll go to him.\n",

      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He loves me so much and wants to marry me, and I love him deeply too — it’s always been my dream to marry someone I love. But lately, there are a few things that feel off. Sometimes I wonder if I’m making a mistake or lowering my standards. And maybe he feels the same — I’m not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the things that bother me: 1.Whenever we fight, he starts cussing and calling me names.\n",
      "2.He never takes pictures of me. I know some boyfriends aren’t into photography, and that’s fair — but in my case, I’ve told him many times that it matters to me. I’ve asked him to take pictures or record small moments, not just of me, but us. He never does.\n",
      "3.He doesn’t always respect my opinions. Sometimes, I feel like there’s a subtle competition between us instead of support.\n",
      "4.On my last birthday, he didn’t even give me a gift. I understand money can be tight sometimes, and I don’t expect anything fancy (he earns) — my dad pampers me a lot and gives me everything I need, so maybe that’s why I have expectations. But I didn’t want something expensive — just flowers would’ve meant a lot. I celebrate him, so I just wish he celebrated me a little too.and \n",
      "5.I want small gestures — a flower, a note, anything. Am I expecting too much?\n",
      "6.We’ve had sex just 3 times in 3 years. But we do enjoy our fun moments, and those times are genuinely great.\n",
      "7.He never liked me having male friends, and I respected that. In all 4 years of college, I never had any male friends — even though we were in the same college.\n",
      "My issue is simple: I feel a lack of affirmation, acts of service, and respect.\n",
      "He’s called me horrible names in the past, including “sl*t.” Sometimes during fights, he says very hurtful things. He never really celebrates me. I’ve never felt seen by him. But he always wants to go out with me and spend quality time, which I genuinely enjoy. And he’s extremely loyal — no contact with any girls or anything shady. That’s one of the best things about him.\n",
      "But he’s made me feel insecure so many times. During fights, when I get emotional or throw a tantrum, he doesn’t comfort me — he never sends long texts to say sorry, never calls to express how much he loves me. I guess he’s not expressive, so I give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "Still, in fights, he tells me to go look in the mirror, or says I could do better, then the next day, he acts like nothing happened and tries to fix things. Honestly, I do give him credit — he has saved our relationship many times. But I also feel like I’m too easy to convince. We’re both deeply attached. Three years is a long time. We’ve made such good memories together. I know he loves me, and I love him too.\n",
      "But yesterday, I told him everything and broke up.We’ve never stayed away from each other for more than a day, so this is hard.Now that we’ve graduated, I’m moving to a different city for my studies, and he’s staying back. A long-distance relationship is going to be tough — especially since he doesn’t trust me. He always wants to know where I am, even though I’m a homebody and mostly go out only with family or with him. He has all my passwords. I’m not hiding anything.\n",
      "He’s truly a sweet boy, and I know he really loves me — it shows in so many ways. I love him too, deeply. But honestly, I feel like maybe it’s better for both of us to break up and take some time to be single — to grow individually and focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves.\n",
      "I truly believe that growth is important — for him and for me. We both have dreams and goals, and maybe this space will help us achieve them without distractions or emotional weight. And who knows, if destiny has its way, maybe we’ll find our way back to each other someday.\n",
      "For now, I just hope he continues to grow into a great man and becomes the kind of partner he’s truly capable of being. And I’ll focus on becoming the woman I want to be too.\n",
      "So, what should I do?\n",
      "Will I ever find someone who’s loyal like him? Or am I just too easy? Do I not deserve to be treated like I’m special — to be given that “princess treatment”?\n",
      "I don’t know. I have so much self-doubt.\n",
      "Should I leave this relationship?\n",
      "Or should I talk to him and give it one last chance and start as fresh?\n",
      "I’ve already talked to him so many times, and told him what hurts me. I know I’m not perfect — but when I love someone, I want to be pampered and cared for. Even when I push him away during fights, I hope he’d come back with respect and tell me how much he loves me — not by yelling or insulting me, but by reassuring me. I want someone who has eyes only for me, someone who adores me. I want to feel safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I’m willing to change too. For him, for us. But respect comes from the heart — and love and respect are not the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. We love each other, but there’s been disrespect, lack of effort, and emotional hurt. He’s loyal, but not expressive or supportive in ways I need. I broke up with him recently because I feel we need time to grow individually, but I’m confused — am I expecting too much? Should I give him one last chance or move on?\n",

      "We’ve been dating for almost 2 years and she moved in with me during mid February of this year. I was starting to have doubts about the relationship before she moved in. We were arguing a lot more (usually over small things) and noticing that we have a lot less in common than we originally thought. We’ll watch some shows together occasionally but that’s about it.

It makes me feel awful every time because I DO love her and don’t want to hurt her. I love her and care about her a lot but I don’t necessarily feel in love with her anymore so I feel like I’m not giving her what she deserves either.\n",

I don’t always eat your food, It was maybe five times” and he knows that that’s just a lie and anytime I set boundaries around my food he literally gets upset and I was like oh I hate having to beg you guys for food this and that And then today I was literally looking forward to eating my food, and I go downstairs to the fridge and all of the food is like gone and he left me a corner and I literally just crashed out and started crying because I’m just fed up and I’m also like a food lover like food is one of the last things that keeps me going I’m just like upset and also I’ve had one meal today so it’s just annoying at this point and I can’t afford to move out he’s just really the worst idk what to I do. \n",

      "Body text: Hi all,\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going through a rough time currently. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years have started (2 years ago) having these random fights on and off. It’s important to note that 29 out of 31 days of the month, we are happy, loving, caring, we are intimate, we go do really fun things together and we support each other through hard times. Making me feel so in love with her, and these “breakup” periods truly hurt. Now for the hard part the fighting, In the past it had typically started due to something I would say or do, while nothing major ever, she would find a way to take something I said politically for example into a screaming match that ended with 1-2 days of no contact. Her reasoning, though in the past never logical or equating to the treatment I received, she had something to at least blame the fight on. And that made it really easy for me to accept I was at fault, and apologize hoping to smooth things over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her typical course of action, would be to yell and scream at me, this escalation would typically happen immediately. Within 1 minute of her explaining an issue, she would already be yelling, and saying things like fuck you, fuck yourself, you are a loser, and calling me every name under the sun. Within 5-10 minutes of her yelling at me, she would typically pack her stuff up, leave, block me, and not talk to me for atleast 24 hours sometimes longer. She then typically comes to talk to me, and she gets over it and I’m a large part of that as for a long time I would just keep asking her to cool down, and do everything I could to smooth it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to note, I’ve never started one of these fights with her or screamed at her. I always come to her with my issue and we are able to handle it cordially, as long as I don’t criticize her heavily. She is always the aggressor. She doesn’t apologize, she doesn’t take accountability, and she just blames blames blames, me for everything, even things that make no sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as of recent, these fights that I used to be able to justify as, I may have done something small wrong. Well, the 2 most recent fights I can’t justify at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "1st - She got home after work, found out a package at her apartment was stolen, blamed me for her forgetting to grab the package, and just completely lost it on me. Started saying the most hurtful things ever, calling me names, telling me she hates me. This lasted for 2 days before we talked, and kind of acted like it didn’t happen and moved on. Since then things have been great for 25-30 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd - Then she got upset with me for staying at my place and me sleeping in 2 hours after working late to support us. She proceeded to get very nasty again, and walk out on me. Yelling, screaming, and the rest ensued, and I didn’t do anything to help it. I continued the fight, chased her, and made it worse. In the end we both yelled at each other and that was the end of it\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I’m alone, and wondering what I do. I love this woman so much, the good times are some of the best times I’ve had with anyone. She supports me, has been there for me on some of the hardest days and vice versa. We have many mutual friends, we see each others families. And to be honest, I struggle to see a life without her. I know we will talk again at some point, but the important question is what does that talk look like. Is it ending the relationship for good, is it trying to work on this and continue. What is going to get me to a place in life where I’m happy?\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: My girlfriend goes from kissing me and sending me TikTok’s and videos about how much she loves me, to within 30 minutes screaming at me and berating me for no reason. This has gone on for 1 year, but it has gotten more random and the blows ups have gotten worse, more nasty language and longer no contact periods\n",

This isnt a post to complain about long distance relationships so please spare me from that. We love each other so much, I'll never find anyone else like her and she thinks the same. Since we are approaching uni (well she did last year already) we are talking and fighting a lot about the fact that I think she should come live here because I literally live in a big city (Rome) and she lives in a way smaller town, like crazy small compared to my city. Im not saying it just cause, her uni is here (she takes online classes), there are way more opportunities in general (she doesnt even have food delivery to say one). Turns out she doesnt wanna move, she has a full time job rn and doesnt want to leave it and her family. We basically have no future I guess... but we love each other so much, what should I do?

      "Body text: So, I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 2.5 years, but we’ve been friends for much longer. In September, we moved out of my parents' house to a new city far away from out hometown, and I really like it here. She’s a very emotional person, and I feel like I can tell her everything, knowing she’ll always be there for me. I love her very much and care about her wellbeing. I also enjoy cooking, which is why I usually take care of the cooking in our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a rule that whoever is cooking doesn’t have to clean up afterward. This is mostly due to our tempers — we tend to fight over small things. Today we had another fight because I put away the ingredients after making dinner, but didn’t clean the countertops. I told her she should clean it, since I spent about 45 minutes cooking while she was playing Sims 4. She got upset and reminded me that she won’t clean up after me because I didn’t clean the kitchen after breakfast. Usually I make breakfast for the two of us or we eat alone.\n",

      "She told me she’s exhausted from living with me. The thing is, I feel like I do around 60% of the chores in our house. I have ADHD, so sometimes I forget to put a plate away or close a cabinet. I understand that it can be a burden for her when I leave these things for a few hours, but I’m the one cleaning the whole apartment every Saturday, while she only cleans the bathroom. I’m okay with that because, until recently, she worked on Saturdays.\n",

When I do have free time, I try to focus on my hobbies, which are making music and skateboarding. I love my life and try to stay optimistic, even though it’s not always easy. I’m not passionate about my degree, but I want to secure a good job in the future, especially since my girlfriend is studying Vocal Jazz at a music university. Even though it’s very hard to get into, it probably won’t bring her much financial security. She’s not sure about this career path and often tells me she doesn’t belong there (although she’s very talented and trained a lot when she was younger). I remind her that she won’t get another chance to get a prestigious degree title with that little effort. Don’t get me wrong — she prepares for her classes, but it doesn’t take her much time. Also professor there are very little concerned about skipping classes, when at my Uni I can’t skip even one hour.\n",

      "She comes from a poor family, and I don’t want her to worry about money. I’m not rich either, but we’re doing okay. That’s why I pay for food and heating, and I sometimes buy her nice things. On the other side last month she didn’t even get me a birthday present because she didn’t have money, which I’m fine with. She ordered sushi so it’s not like she forgot, but a present don’t have to be expensive. Also it kinda itch me, cause a week earlier, she bought a fairly expensive gift for her friend.\n",

      "Body text: Basically, I’ve never been in a relationship because I’m pretty insecure. I’m a bit overweight, short, and don’t think girls usually go for guys like me. There’s this girl in my course who’s really nice—she’s called me cute a few times, but I assume it’s just friendly.\n",

      "I followed her on Instagram, and she liked two of my stories (a landscape and one of me). One of my friends, who’s also close to her and usually sits with us in class, once asked, “Why don’t you date her?” It sounded ironic, but his tone was kind of serious. Another time, when I mentioned shaving my (barely-there) beard, he said, “She likes you with a beard.”\n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend invited me to join him at a friend’s after birthday party and I agreed to come. When we went to the club, one of his (female) friends was texting him like “oh im with someone who I don’t trust, can you take me back to your place for a bit then we go to the club together.” I’m not sure at that point she was aware that I was coming as well. He didn’t come get her or take her back to his place of course, because we were already at the club at that point. We did wait for her to come join us at the club, which she eventually came with this man who she “couldn’t trust”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was worried about her too so I did greet her and made sure she was okay when she arrived. However, I was annoyed that she did not try to introduce herself to me or anything (because we haven’t met and I have no clue what kind of friend she is). She only said to me: “I didn’t trust the guy I came with, and I trust X (my boyfriend). I didn’t react well and acted a bit annoyed at her (which she didn’t seem to care), and tried to separate us at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we eventually met again with the rest of his friend group, I really lost it when she tried to pull him closer to say something to him.

      "Title: I (F40) feel extremely hurt and stressed by my boyfriend (M40) not prioritising us in the way I would like\n",
      "Body text: My boyfriend (M40) and I (F40) have been together for 5+ years. In January last year he was dropping heavy hints and I told him to spit it out and he said he wanted to get married/move in together/have kids. I told him that's great, but he's done no emotional work in our relationship. I pointed out to him that I am the one who's setting up our dates, making sure we see each other once or twice a week, and bringing up hard conversations. I told him that if he wanted to get married, we'd need to have those hard conversations and he needed to be able to do the emotional work, because if he didn't, I eventually wouldn't, and the relationship would fail. I told him he needed to initiate these conversations. We talked about the different topics we needed to talk about, and I told him he would need to look into the issues other couples had run into and their solutions to inform our conversations. He listened to this and said we would have conversations every week. I said \"wow, that's a lot\", but said I would leave it with him, and wouldn't say anything else because this was now his domain and I would follow his lead. I make sure to let him know he can ask for help, but he needs to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "By April, I hadn't heard anything about it, so even though I said I wouldn't say anything else about it, I checked in with him.. He said he hadn't done anything. A few weeks later, he told me he was done, and gave me a notebook with questions written in it and his replies. The questions were the first hit when googling \"questions to ask before marriage\" and some were not even relevant to us. His replies were 1 or 2 sentences. I was disappointed and upset, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to ruin our upcoming trip. He proposed on that trip. I told him \"it's not a no\" but clarified it wasn't exactly a yes either. We talked about what I had expected from him. We talked about why. We went through the notebook and talked about the things in there and he made notes for what we need to talk about further. He promised we would talk every week. We come back from our trip and we do not talk every week.\n",

      "In September he does a finance talk. This is great! I'm excited. \"Okay, what's next? What's the plan? What else do we have?\" I say and, well, there's nothing. I leave the country to travel for a bit and he says he will work on it while I'm away. In December I ask him if he has anything. He doesn't have anything. I ask him if he knows what I'm asking for, why I'm asking for it, and we go over the reasons AGAIN. He says he understands now. We talk about potential resources. I told him I know it's hard, but it's hard for me too but I STILL DO IT, like it took me 2 weeks to bring up that very conversation. I point out to him that if this was HIS JOB he would have done it by now. I point out how hurtful it is that he's not prioritising it. He again promises to have talks every week. For the first week, it happens. He tells me he's been reading the Gottmann books, and we go through an exercise they have. The next two weeks I am traveling again. When I get back, I'm sick for a couple of weeks. His sister is visiting. There are x amount of reasons that there are no talks. Shortly after Valentine's day, I decide that's it and try to leave. He mollifies me by saying he's been reading the Gottmann books and we just haven't had the talks because xx reasons. I tell him he needs to COMMUNICATE and try and make up for the talks. He apologises and agrees. We start having our Gottmann exercises. It goes well for the first few weeks, then they start petering off from every week to every other week. It's been 3 weeks now without one. He also initiated one discussion about me moving in and we've done general stuff around that, but no other discussions since about me moving in and the things I told him he needed to follow up on, or any other discussions. He has gotten better at planning dates and making sure we spend time with each other every week. \n",

      "  \n",
      "I'm so stressed about this. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying I need to leave this guy. I sometimes feel like just pushing him out of bed when he misses initiating a weekly discussion.  I know emotional work is hard for men, but it's hard for me too. I love him and he's actually great otherwise (apart from his sometimes terrible taste in music) - he's gentle, emotionally supportive, learned how to give massages so he could give them to me, my friends like him, he cooks, etc., and I do want to marry him IF HE COULD JUST DO THIS ONE THING. I don't feel like I'm a high-maintenance girlfriend. I don't ask for much. I'm asking for this because if we don't have this the relationship will fall apart eventually anyway, and I have been telling him this over and over again. I am so stressed. I don't want to nag at him about this, because he either pioritises this or he doesn't. I don't want to spend the rest of my life having to nag a husband to do things that I have pointed out over and over again are important for our relationship I don't know what to do. Should I try again to have another conversation or is 17 months really enough time to realise he will never ever ever prioritise what I  think is important for our relationship? Of course there's the added complication about our ages. He wants kids. I think they might be great. But my womb can't wait another 5 years for me to realise he will never get his shit together, then find another partner and have kids with him.\n",

      "Body text: I (19) and him (20) moved together approximetly 1,5 years ago. We are now almost a couple for 4 years and since we moved together we have I would say a lot of fights. Its always about something small, something not important but everytime we fight it drains me completely. I often cry without a reason and I cry everytime we have a fight. I started doubting our relationshop after a while because I just felt sad all the time. I was the happiest person when we werent fighting. I still love him but last year around november he told me that a few weeks prior he used an app similar to tinder but to find friends. He wanted to find friends in our area because we moved far away from our families and I understood that. Then he told me he first wanted to only text other men but he couldnt find people he could be friends with. Then he switched to find female and male friends but still not a lot of success. Then he switched to look only for women and he texted a lot of them he said. That was our first conversation about that and I wasnt very happy about him looking for female friends but I knew how bad he wanted friends and also he said that he has no contact to any of those women and that he deleted that app. So fast forward to a few days later where he confessed that thats not the whole story. He then told me he texted primarly beautiful women and also started conversation with compliments (I would rarely get compliments from him) so that already hurt me a little. But then he proceeded to tell me that he also asked some women for their instagram or snapchat but he had already unfollowed them. Then he told me that he had also told a few women that he is single but he apperently just wanted to see how they would react. He promised me he would never to such a thing again but obviously I lost a lot of trust in him. There was a lot more and I tried to forget these things but there was nothing that counted as real cheating. I still dont know if what he did is cheating so please tell me your opinion. Now almost 6 months later I still think about it and I am not sure if it was the right thing to completely forgive him. Just as backround knowledge: I dont talk to my parents anymore and also dont have any real friends who I could talk with about this and I think that thats also a reason why I stayed. I dont have anywhere to go if I break up with him.\n",

      "Tl;dr: My bf and I are arguing a lot after we moved together and he texted women on a app similar to tinder 6 months ago and I still dont know if it was the right thing to forgive him.

      "I dont know if my story is understandable but if it was please help me. I really dont know what I should do now. I still think about what he told me 6 months ago but I told him I forgive him.

      "Title: I screwed up my first relationship, and I don’t know how to live with that.\n",
      "Body text: Hi everyone. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve been in my first ever relationship for about a year now. She’s also 20, and it’s her second relationship. Honestly, it was something really special to me – we had our ups and downs, sure, but in many ways, it felt close to perfect. Until I messed it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give some context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her last relationship, her ex betrayed her trust. He was constantly in contact with other girls behind her back, liking and saving revealing posts on Instagram and TikTok, and then gaslighting her by saying it was all “normal.” Over time, she lost trust in him completely and broke up with him. It really hurt her, and I knew that. She made it very clear early on that this kind of behavior was something she couldn’t tolerate again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here’s where I messed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, she was using my phone and ended up in the “Recently Deleted” folder in my gallery. She found a screenshot I had taken of some random girl on Instagram leaning over a table – not naked or anything, but obviously showing her butt in tight clothes. I had screenshotted it like a month ago, realized how dumb that was, and deleted it. But it was still there in the deleted folder. She was absolutely shocked and disappointed – like she said she would’ve never expected this from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, she also checked TikTok on my iPad and saw my search history. It included the names of some girls – some we had gossiped about at work, like an ex of a friend or someone who came up in conversation – but also one or two typical TikTok thirst-trap creators. I didn’t like, comment, or save anything, but the fact that I had searched them up made it look like I was obsessively seeking that kind of content behind her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it instantly reminded her of her ex and that she felt like I was no different. She told me she doesn’t see me the same anymore. That even if she gave me another chance, she’d never be able to fully trust me again. She also said she’d always remember this and be angry about it, that I ruined something that had so much potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, I completely own up to it. I told her I’m not trying to excuse what I did. It wasn’t out of lust or craving for attention – it was more of a dumb Jeffrey-brain moment, a mix of impulsiveness, curiosity, and gossip with coworkers. I know it sounds like a cliché excuse. But I swear I didn’t mean to hurt her. And now I’ve become the exact person she was afraid of.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things even harder – literally the day she saw all this, she flew out on a two-week trip with her parents. Before this all happened, I had agreed to stay at her place to watch her cat and water her plants while she’s away. So now I’m here in her apartment, alone, surrounded by memories of a relationship that feels like it’s already over. A place that used to feel safe and full of love now feels cold and heavy. I feel completely destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how I’m supposed to live with the guilt if she decides to end things when she comes back. I don’t know how to move on knowing I ruined something with someone who, honestly, felt perfect for me – loyal, principled, kind, beautiful inside and out. I know everyone says that about their ex, but she really was special. I didn’t cheat, but I broke her trust, and maybe that’s just as bad in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for reading. I’m open to any advice or words that might help. I really feel like I’m drowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: I (20M) messed up my first relationship by having some inappropriate content/screenshots and TikTok searches, which triggered my girlfriend’s (20F) trust issues from her previous relationship. She found it right before a two-week trip and now doesn’t see me the same. I regret it deeply and am watching her cat while alone in her place, feeling crushed and lost. I don’t know how to forgive myself or fix anything.\n",

      "Body text: 3 days ago my girlfriend of 9 months and I met up for a drink, when we saw each other we hugged, we kissed we asked how each other has been the past few days. Maybe 30 minutes later I could feel that something was off, she wasn't talking as much and there wasn't that connection. One thing to keep in mind is that my girlfriend is an avoidant, she shows those traits in our relationship. While we were at the bar I popped off the bar and knew that there was something we had to discuss. I maybe didn't bring it up in the best way, I came back out and said \"So are we gonna talk about something because I can feel that something is off\" she replied with \"I think we are having so many problems\" she started rambling and explaining her feelings which I tried to comfort her, it ended up with her saying that \"I think I should break up with you\" I tried to keep it together for the whole conversation but at the end I did get a emotional. I told her that we can work through these problems. I hugged her and told her that \"it's okay\". She said she needed space to think about everything, which is respectable I understand that. She said \"I'll talk to you later\" and we went our seperate ways. I followed up with her that night with a short text saying \"Don't feel and pressure to reply, I understand and respect the fact that you need space. I just hope you're doing okay\" she replied with \"Yes \\*My name\\*, I hope your doing good to\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been about 3 days now and I still haven't heard anything from her.

      "\\-He constantly tells me I’m the most beautiful woman he’s ever talked to, always compliments me, and initiates soft PDA like holding hands or hugging any chance he has.

      "\n",
      "\\-His style and mannerisms are on the more feminine side, for example the way he walks. I actually like that he takes care of himself, but I’ve never dated a man who presents this way and in context, it adds to my doubts.\n",

      "Body text: So there is this coworker(26m) that I’ve (29f) known of for 7 years. We’ve gotten to know each other very well for about the last 2 years. When we first started getting to know each other, he made it clear that he was interested in me. I told him I wasn’t in the space for a relationship because I had just gotten out of a 3 and a half year relationship(engaged, toxic etc.) and that I needed a lot of healing. As I got to know him better I told him I could see a relationship with him in the future but I still wasn’t ready. He told me he would wait for me and I  told him not to put his life on hold for me, but to also be honest with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to this past March and he was acting really off. Come to find out he had been talking to someone. He told me a week after they were official. He told me because of his intense feelings towards me we couldn’t be friends and blocked me. I blocked him back. It sucked because at the time I was just about ready to jump head first into a relationship with him. But it is what it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to Wednesday and a few mutual friends reached out to me and told me that his relationship didn’t last, that he wanted to talk to me and possibly work things out with me. I didn’t know what to think of it all, but I was curious as to what he had to say. So I unblocked him and sent him a text. He asked to call me. We talked on the phone for three hours. He told me his ex was “crazy”, demanded he change his locks, wanted him to get a different apartment, didn’t like his family etc. all within the one month they dated LOL…. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he apologized for not being honest with me about how he went about getting into that relationship and asked if we could start fresh and actually try to give it a go and see where things go- not official but with the understanding we’re ready for it if the vibe was still there. We talked on the phone for an hour and a half on Thursday as well. So we made plans for him to come stay at my place on Friday- Sunday. Friday rolls around and he calls me and says he can’t come because he forgot about this wing fest thing with his sister, sisters boyfriend and 2 friends. So he wanted to reschedule for today. This morning rolls around and he cancels again. This time it’s because his parents are in Portugal and their flight kept getting delayed and he needed to go over to their house to “take care of it”. That part confused me because I had no clue they were in Portugal on vacation, they have no pets,  no one was there for 7 days but on day 8 someone needs to be? Odd\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I checked his Snapchat location which he alwayyyysss leaves on. It was turned off all day. I didn’t say anything about it and offered to give him a call later today. He told me , “I’ll let you know”…. I didn’t respond to this text and he never reached out or called. This is coming from the guy that I used to talk with on the phone 3 times a day with. The guy that was all about communication. The guy that would find any reason for me to come visit or would always offer to visit me. The guy that always told close friends how much he cared about me. This is not the guy I know. \n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of behavior is very similar to my exes and therefore I didn’t respond to his last text saying , “I’ll let you know” , because honestly if he wanted to he would and a phone call is not too much too ask. \n",
      "\n",

      "Title: My(26F) husband's(26M) friend(?F) keeps crossing boundaries and causing fights, yet he is still friends with her.\n",
      "Body text: This has been an extremely contentious subject in our marriage (married 2 yrs, together 8yrs) for the past few months. Some context, my husband (26 trans M) has been in military reclass school for the past 5ish months while I (26F) have been holding it down at home alone. We will call this friend Amanda (trans F). I'm unsure of how old she is, but she seems to be around our age. Amanda and my husband were introduced d/t their similar circumstances when he arrived at the base. They hit it off fast, especially with the state of politics in the US and the military trans ban leading to them leaning on each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I was very happy for him to have this friend for a while, and thought it was good for him until about a month into their friendship. Amanda revealed that her wife consented to an open marriage, and then proceeded to proposition my husband. My husband kindly but firmly shut it down, and then told me about it immediately. Amanda did not accept this rejection well and continued to make comments/jokes for the next few days, things like how it would \"enhance their friendship\". It got to a point that he had a frank and firm conversation with her that her comments/jokes had to stop or they couldn't continue the friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Amanda's credit, she stopped.....for a time. Between this first concerning event and now, various things have happened (all of which I have been informed about promptly by my husband). Nothing quite to the extent of outright propositioning him again, but actions which have made me, my husband, and any of his or my friends uncomfortable to hear. A few that come to mind are: good morning and good night messages daily, gifting items upwards of $50 without reason, showing up at his morning coffee place daily once she realized that he was there every morning, getting drunk and making sexually aggressive jokes towards him while playing video games together, whispering things into his ear that could have been spoken outloud, hugs that have lingered for too long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, there is a pattern of about 4ish weeks. Amanda will do something that makes him uncomfortable enough that he has a discussion with her and tells her to knock it off. She is good for about a week or two and then starts back up again for weeks 3/4. It seems to me like Amanda isn't getting emotional fulfillment in her own marriage and is using my husband to fill that role. This obviously makes me exceedingly uncomfortable. Now I don't believe in ultimatums in a marriage, and I know that she is a friend who my husband relies on a lot. They are both going through the same issues with the military, and I work nights as a nurse, so I am asleep most of the time that he is awake. He sees this person as a positive in his life and credits her as the reason he hasn't fallen into a depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have never once asked him to cut Amanda out of his life; I have asked for reasonable boundaries or behavior changes. However, a few days ago, something one of his guy friends said finally clicked in his head, leading to him deciding to cut her off on his own. Unfortunately, something happened last night after an event involving both my husband and Amanda that was quite traumatic. I won't get into it here, but this event caused them to begin speaking again, and they \"trauma bonded\" (my husband's words). \n",
      "\n",
      "While discussing whether this meant he would continue to communicate with Amanda, we got into a fight. He got angry when I said I cared about Amanda \"as much as one human should care about another human\" but that I didn't care about her emotions regarding my apathy towards her. He began to yell, which caused me to get emotional and cry. He got angrier and said some things that he now says he regrets, as did I. He went to bed, I went to work, but now I don't know what to do. I don't want to cause my husband any pain, but I really think this is causing a serious strain on our marriage. What would you guys do? \n",
      "\n",
      "Additional info: There is no doubt in my mind that my husband hasn't and won't cheat on me, let alone with Amanda. Our time apart will be ending in about a month and then he will be coming home and won't be interacting with Amanda in person anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: my husband's friend asked to sleep with him, he said no. She continues to cross boundaries but he wants to remain friends. What do I do?\n",

      "Body text: I (F35) and my business partner Molly (F38) started a small musical org almost 3 years ago.

      "I've tried multiple approaches to help solve for this, including multiple meetings, clearer role definitions and breakdowns, calendars, etc, all of which she agreed to in theory but not in practice. I feel like I'm the one managing things professionally, while also managing her *and* being the emotional barometer for our relationship. I'm exhausted and done, especially after the past two weeks.

However, if she reacts poorly then we could be in for a really rough week that could reflect poorly on us both. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context about where things are: 1.5 weeks ago, I finally professionally and firmly called her out more directly on a big bungle caused by her last-minuteness (far from the first time this kind of thing has happened). She deflected, took no responsibility for it, and tried to turn it back around on me. When I brought it back around to the issue at hand, she stopped responding. This included ignoring two other emails with time-sensitive logistical tasks that needed answers from her (including one involving our partner org), so after asking for input and receiving silence, I proceeded without her. \n",

      "Body text: Dated this girl for 3 months and it was insane. Best relationship I ever had, so passionate and intimate. We both liked each other a lot and connected so well. She just broke up with me. Caught me blindsided, she had some issues with me not “opening up to her” about some things I was dealing with. The two main issues she had was she hadn’t met my parents yet (yes 3 months is still pretty new) but her argument was I already knew hers from early on. And she said she knew I was going through something but didn’t know what until I finally did open up about the complications with my mom’s cancer. She felt horrible for me, but tried to say this whole time she involved me with every aspect of her life and this whole time I left her in the dark. She felt like I was hiding something. I explained that I’m slow to fully trust anymore, I used to put blind trust in people early in the past and it’s always backfired. I told her I’d bring her home to meet the folks and assured her I had nothing to hide. My friends take on this was that she sounds manipulative but I really didn’t get that impression (being in the full context) yeah I did have some fault in all of this and I realize it now. A week later she broke up with me. She said she needs to work on getting over some problems from her past and needed to be alone. She said I needed to work on things too. She mentioned that she does “really really like me” and that I make her so happy but she just “can’t do this right now” when we broke up we talked for 3 hours. It was a very emotional conversation, we both heard each other. Neither of us got mad or lost our cool. We even shared a few laughs. She left it at, “Not never but not now, maybe we can try being friends and ease back into things after I have some time to myself” \n",

      "To clarify I am 95% positive she is not going to be talking to or entertaining other men during this time but I did not ask. I am going to give her some space in the hopes that she soon comes around and reaches out. I truly believe we moved too fast and things got real fast and it scared her. I figured I’ll give it 6 ish weeks and if I haven’t heard back I might reach out and see if she wants to catch up over coffee. She even went as far as to say I can still txt or call when I’m having a bad day and she doesn’t want me out of her life. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m still just confused about the whole situation but I understood her well and I somewhat understand why she feels the way she does… I just would have though she’d try to work through things together with how well we connected.

      "Body text: I have two old high school friends(23f)and(23m)that have become more online friends in these later years.Knew my girl friend for 6 years then reconnected after five,and knew my guy friend for 8 years.Both messaged me first about reconnecting basically saying cause they enjoyed my friendship.My male friend was one of the healthiest relationships in high school when I was very unhealthy.And I had ups and downs with my girl friend,but recently she reached out and did  apologize for things she did & is trying to do better.\n",

      "Now my guy friend and me have been talking longer since reconnecting after 2019.We’ve met up some,but then things got busy for him & he started to move around so we’ve been messaging instead.I thought things were going good,but the times we message/called started to get farther apart until we rarely messaged even.And now it’s difficult to even get a conversation going through.And last we talked on the phone it was me carrying the conversation,and him talking about all his stuff going on.Which would be fine,but he didn’t even bother asking me anything.And it’s just been him send online videos.So now I’m doubting if he’s even interested in talking anymore.He’s a very social guy,but prefers talking in person and just seems he’s only focused on a boyfriend or finding another.\n",

      "Body text: I feel like I can’t keep going in this relationship. Me (f21) and my husband (M22) we got married in October (I know we are young) I love him so much. Though lately we can’t seem to stop arguing. I grew up with two parents that have loved each other since they met. He grew up with his parents together but no love involved his mom resented his dad and his dad is an alcoholic. I feel like this contributes to him, his father never spoke up or communicated his feelings or was romantic so I feel like that’s maybe why he isn’t super thoughtful or romantic. I’ve voiced what makes me feel dismissed or hurt in the relationship and he doesn’t change. I recently found myself regretting getting married but I know he loves me or did at some point right now I feel like he’s stringing me along and I have no idea what to do. I love him so much but it hurts staying with him at this point. We have our good days and I know he loves me to an extent but I feel like he’s just scared of letting go or maybe I’m over thinking. I just wanted some advice if we should just let go or did anyone enter this rough patch? We have been married HALF A YEAR. And over half of it we’ve been arguing like crazy. I’ll go to sleep crying he won’t come to me. I have voiced that I’ll leave if he doesn’t change and I get minimal reaction or says “fine but I’m not moving im going to stay here with you” so I’m just so confused and hurt. He says he doesn’t want to lose me and wants to stay together but I don’t know. \n",

      "Body text: (TLDR at bottom)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I 14NB and my ex-best friend 15F haven't spoken outside of professionalism in 3 months. Since we share classes and clubs there is still the occasional question or request, but nothing personal. (Except for today but I'll get to that later) I don't necessarily want to fix things, that ship has sailed, but I do want to find closure for both of our sakes, our anxiety and our parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all started around spring break, where we both went on vacation, me to Europe and her to Japan. Over the course of our 2 week vacations we texted for avg over 1 hour per day. In addition to this, there was also common facetime calls to check in on each other. Now, I had literally never had anyone care about me this much (or seem to anyways) basically ever, not anyone I had ever considered a best friend, not therapists, not my parents. And, that's at no fault of their own, they are all good people but you know how teens are with there parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, during these 2 weeks I started to develop a pretty big crush on her, and I showed it in my texting, being pretty obvious, flirting, calling her cute, VERY clear messaging. And, at the time at least, I thought it was being reciprocated. She responded in kind, flirtatious jokes, messages, subtleties, etc. And I may not be the best at social cues but she was reciprocating I swear But, I thought I was crazy so I asked my sisters, one of whom being a practiced \"Flirt\". (Her words not mine). And, both of them told me that there was a near certain chance that she liked me. So, I set out to tell her, arranging a time the Monday after we returned (AKA the first day of school back). And this was my first mistake. Jet lag, other problems she had that I literally had no way of knowing about and I guess more problems we both had lead to what was, verbally, the perfect confession. Unfortunately, verbally isn't just how things work. I may have said the right words, but through the tears, the pauses and the timings in which I said them made it worse than the time I got my friend to tell someone I liked that I liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assumed (since I thought I knew this girl it was literally the perfect friendship) that it'd take a few days, maybe a week for her to come to terms with it and that we could then start being friends again, starting slowly and moving up to something more, well, friendly. I knew I could do this as one of the only things I am good at is moving on from being rejected, and I was over it in like 3 days. What I was not over however, was the fact that I thought I had hurt her so effing badly. She hadn't come to school in a week, wasn't replying to my texts asking if she was okay. For all I knew, she was dead. So, after like a week of me spending all day on my bed crying my eyes out (again, not cause of the rejection, cause I was scared I had hurt her) I shot her another text essentially saying that \"Its pretty fucking clear you hate me know, I just want to make sure you're okay and then you don't have to talk to me ever again\". And, I waited. Waited for a while. I sent a follow-up \"I know I hurt you and I just want to say that I'm here if you need me and I want you to feel better about *everything.* Now we come to my next mistake. Because she had told me she wanted space but my anxiety ridden brain was telling me \"You caused a problem so fix it you asshole\". So, I did. I kept texting her, bi-daily, until my thick head finally got the message. Something that also helped me get the message was her calling me selfish, despite the only thing I wanted for myself was for her to feel better?? Still genuinely confused abt that. So, I sent one final text, leading with \"This will be my final contact unless you reply. I know when I am not wanted. Insert me saying I'm here if she needs me, not here if she isn't, that I just want to help, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, she told me that she did still want to be friends and just wanted to take it slowly. So I did. I stopped texting her, I went back to school and I was normal, I talked to her if I saw her but was careful not to overstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "FF 2 months ish later and she literally hasn't said a fucking word to me at all. Now, context for this next part, we are both in the yearbook club and since I had a free block and I saw a couple of the members (her being one of them), I asked if there was anything I could work on for it. (we are super behind so time is of the essence). The other guy said \"No I don't know\". I then turned to her, asked her the same. Her exact words were \"If I wanted you to do something I probably would just do it myself.\" Obviously a shot. And, a cruel one at that. Not only implying that I'm useless, but that she is better than me at whatever it is I was going to try and do. And, what did I do?? I turned, tears in my eyes (literally) away from her and said \"Thanks\" sarcastically. To no response. Looking back on it now, It would have been much more satisfying to curse her out and call her on all the shit she's put me through. (3 months of literally having 0 people to talk to, not even casually, 3 months of suicidal thoughts, 3 months of my anxiety spirally like nothing else, 2 months of depression controlling me, 3 months of me being an asshole to everyone I know, 3 months of contemplating how many of my other relationships were so fragile that a couple of texts could break them, 3 months of pain.) But, I didn't. Although GOD DAMN would it have felt satisfying.\n",

      "Our school is weird and ends 2 weeks earlier, so we have like 3 weeks left total. I know reconciliation is past us at this point, but is there anything I can do to find closure? Any conversations I can have. Just more context, out of anger at myself for being so stupid and ruining the only good friendship I've ever had I deleted her number and contact so I literally can't text her even if I wanted to. But I think about her every day, just because I want to know really what the FUCK she is thinking that warrants putting someone through 3 months of torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I probably come across as an asshole in this post, not respecting someone's need for space and wanting closure for myself when clearly she's fine just leaving me behind, but at this point I don't care. I don't care what internet strangers think, I don't care what she thinks of me beyond this, I just need closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah. This took me over an hour to type and edit, so please let me know about ANYTHING I can do or any other subs I can put it in that are a little bigger. And, if there is nothing I can do, Imma just curse her out and walk away. Again, its the asshole move but I'm below being a decent person right now.

      "Body text: I’m 21(f) and my partner is 22(f) We’ve been together for 3 years. She’s had a tough time lately. Her grandpa passed 2 months ago very suddenly and her grandma a few weeks ago. She works a very high pressure job that didn’t allow her basically any time off to deal with it.\n",

She is sober during the day (when working) but at night she almost always has to have something. Do I have to walk away ? Do I have to put me first here ? Is this an incredibly selfish way to think? I have never loved anyone more than I have loved this woman but I feel like I’m always giving her a hard time about it. I feel like I’m always complaining to her about her habits. I feel like I’m the only person in her life that sees the slippery slope she is on and is willing to say it bluntly to her.

      "Body text: My (27F) boyfriend (26M) have been together for 5 years. It has been up and down to say the least but we really enjoy doing the same things and have similar values. The problem is our communication. As of late we have been on a positive up , but my boyfriend has been defensive over everything and I feel like I have to clarify EVERYTHING I say. If I say a joke, I have to explain it, if I tell him my opinion, I have to explain it. It’s as if he doesn’t know how I think/ am. After 5 years you would think it’s the case. \n",

      "I’m at a loss today because we had a big fight over nothing and I left his house and we haven’t spoken since. I don’t know what to do, what I should say if I reach out and how we can come back from this if possible. Basically tensions were high from a fight the previous day and I told him if we are going to hang out I don’t want to fight because it’s my first weekend off in 3 months. He agreed. That same night we went out to the store and he was being mopey and I asked what’s wrong. He said we should really talk about the fight. I said I wil talk about it but I don’t want to fight and will only talk about it if he is willing to listen to my side and not become defensive. He wasn’t too thrilled I said this and did not really agree or disagree. He never brought it up. That night we were watching a movie and I put subtitles on a movie and I noticed they were in French and he was trying to get the pause sign to go away and moved the mouse. I also noticed at the same time it’s in French and said move and switched to English. He said it’s crazy that I put the subtitles on without asking him and demanded I take them off because he hates subtitles. He said “you don’t just go to someone’s house and touch their computer and put subtitles on”.  I replied what about me? Because  I have a hard time watching movies without subtitles and this has been going on for 5 years. I was honestly shocked he said that and just let it go but watched the movie in silence and went to bed. Fast forward to the next morning I wanted to tell him why I wasn’t being affectionate due to the previous nights events. He immediately blew up and went on about how I’m wrong for touching the computer. I said I don’t want to argue as it’s my weekend off and he kept going so I said I want to leave. He needed to drive me home and told me to get my sister to come pick me up. He kept emphasizing how what I did is as if I go into a car and turn the ac on, and that that is the drivers job, and how turning the subtitles on is the same idea and he would never do that. I said that I am his gf of 5 years I should be treated a bit different than a stranger. He kinda got it but he laughed while I cried, said I’m unbearable and fucked up and that I shouldn’t talk to him ever again. \n",

      "Title: Boyfriend’s (M18) mom doesn’t approve of me (F20) but has never met me\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years, but his mom doesn’t accept me and I don’t think it’s just because of religious differences. I used to do tarot readings when I first started high school, long before I ever met him. His family is very religious ( he’s a Christian and I’m Buddhist) and when his mom found out about that part of my past, she was really upset and told him to stay away from me. I understand where she’s coming from, since those things can be seen as going against her beliefs. But I had already stopped doing tarot before we even became serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We met in high school during my junior year and his sophomore year. At first, we were just friends and hung out a few times in May. Things became more serious around August of my senior year, we’d walk home from school together and really started building a strong connection. But when his mom found out, she got angry and made sure he didn’t walk with me anymore or spend time with me. He’s told me how she acts cold or petty whenever she knows we’re talking or sees the gifts I’ve given him. One Christmas, I gave him matching plaid pajamas, and when she saw them, she said, “Why don’t you go live with my name? She can buy all your clothing.” I laughed when he told me, but deep down, it hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She doesn’t like that we still talk or even that he sees me briefly when I pick up my sister from school. I graduated a year before him, and he’s graduating this year (2025). She works in the school district, and while I was still a student, she told one of my teachers or counselors that she disapproved of our relationship and would never accept it. I felt so humiliated, I cried after hearing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, he showed me a message from her where she said she’ll never approve of our relationship, that I’m not meant for him, and that if he wants to be with me, it won’t be allowed under her roof. She said he has to choose between me and her, that he won’t make her happy if I’m in his life. She even said she’ll continue to spoil him, but never with me around. We’re only about two and a half years apart in age, and she knows that, but that’s never been an issue for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I haven’t really talked about is the fact that I graduated high school a little later than most people. I came to the U.S. when I was six, and because of my late birthday, I didn’t start elementary school until I was seven. That pushed my school timeline a bit, it’s just part of my story (for the title).\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we talk every single day. He’s always been loving, supportive, and constant. One night, he even called me crying. He said he doesn’t know what to do, that he doesn’t want to have to choose between me and his mom. Hearing that broke my heart. He told me he wants to invite me to his graduation, and while I appreciate that deeply, I feel nervous. I know I’ll see his mom there, and I know how she’ll react. He’s also having a graduation party, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll be invited. I understand why but it still hurts. It’s painful because we live just five minutes apart, but we’ve never been able to see each other outside of school except for a few moments in the parking lot when I pick up my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went an entire summer without seeing him, and now that graduation is approaching, I’m preparing for another summer apart. Lately, especially this past week, I’ve felt overwhelmed with sadness. I’ve cried a lot and started acting distant with him not because I blame him, but because the weight of his mom’s disapproval is just so heavy on my heart. What hurts the most is that his mom has never even met me. She doesn’t know who I am she’s judging me based on my past and on assumptions about my beliefs. And I don’t know what I did to deserve that. I’m his first girlfriend, his first love. I just want the chance to be seen for who I really am, to be with him. \n",

      "Body text: (Contains talk of sex and bdsm) \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi y’all, this is gonna be a lot and I’m sorry, I’m just frustrated and not sure how to deal with this. My 28f wife 30f have been together for 2 years, and are both asexual- her being asexual in the way of she’s had a lot of partners and sex is only an act for the other person and she is only along for the ride but doesn’t necessarily enjoy it. I have been heavily sex repulsed for my whole life until I met her, and now I really enjoy sex but only with her. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m struggling with being more comfortable with sex and my body in this relationship now, since it’s still new to me, but we seem to clash in the bedroom now. When we first got together, things were really good and we had sex a lot. Naturally, our sex life had taken a back seat due to working, moving, and just being busy. My anxiety had flared up big time, and now I’m in my head a lot about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "This will get TMI fast, I apologize.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, I made it clear I don’t feel comfortable when we have sex and it’s just me receiving anything. Due to past trauma, it makes me feel absolutely terrible when I’m the only one receiving physical acts. She knows this and I’ve worked on this a lot, so we can on occasion have this kind of sex. She can be a stone top sometimes, and isn’t in the mood to be touched all the time (valid) so we don’t have this type of sex unless we are both comfortable. \n",

      "(We have categorized sex into two things- one, she stone tops and it’s only me receiving, or two we both are receiving something physically. )\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to her not caring about sex much, I am really anxious about making her have sex with me when she doesn’t initiate it. It makes me feel like she’s only doing it since I asked and I feel guilty. But she’s made it so clear that is untrue, and she really enjoys sex with me no matter what, and she would say no if she didn’t want it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the actual problem…. She’s the best, most patient person with me and my anxiety, I love her so much but I’m so frustrated with her right now. She has brought up maybe exploring kinks to see if we can get over my anxiety and bring me out of my head. I love the idea and asked her what she would like to try but she’s leaving it up to me. She has her hard no’s, but is making me choose something to start with. I am so far removed from the kink world that I don’t know what I would like and not like. She has experience as a bdsm dom, so I was hoping she would give me some directions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, I can’t get over the thought that whatever I choose and ask for, she won’t be into and then I’m not interested in it. She isn’t necessarily into anything, but says she will work with whatever I wanna try. But I’m only wanting to try what she wants. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like we’re going around in circles and it’s making me upset and frustrated. She won’t even give me a list of stuff she would even be slightly into. And then her saying she’s not interested in anything, makes me not want to do anything since I’ll feel guilty. \n",

      "Title: [24F] Feeling emotionally numb and unsure if it’s depression, relationship doubts, or both from my [24M] boyfriend\n",
      "Body text: I (24F) have been dating a guy (24M) for a few months now, and from the outside, it looks like a really healthy relationship. He’s kind, emotionally available, thoughtful, and genuinely cares about me—probably more than anyone I’ve dated before. But recently, I’ve started feeling emotionally off, and I don’t know if I’m dealing with depression, if I rushed into something too fast, or if I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first couple months were great. He made it clear he liked me early on, and I really liked him too. I told him I wanted to take it slow, and he respected that, but I still felt bad making him wait. Eventually, I agreed to be official—I wanted to, but looking back, I think I ignored some hesitation because I didn’t want him to think I wasn’t interested. Now I’m wondering if I should’ve waited longer to really get to know him and let the relationship grow more naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past month, I’ve been really withdrawn. I’ve been sad, low-energy, and dealing with really bad body image issues. I don’t feel confident at all, and I don’t want to be touched or intimate because I just feel gross in my own skin. When we hang out, I mostly just want to sit and watch TV—I don’t have energy or motivation for anything else. He asks for physical affection (kisses, cuddles, head scratches, etc.) and while that was fine early on, now it just feels like too much. I know it’s his way of feeling close, and it hurts that I can’t give that to him right now, but I also just…can’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s a more emotionally expressive and affectionate guy than I’m used to. I appreciate that, but it’s different from past relationships and feels like a lot, especially when I’m in this emotional state. I think I’m just overwhelmed. It’s not that I don’t care—I do—but he has more emotional and physical needs than I’m used to managing in a relationship. When I was single, I felt more in control of my life. I had a solid routine: I worked out more, ate better, and felt like I was really taking care of myself. Now I feel like I’ve lost that rhythm, and it’s stressing me out. I miss that freedom of not having to consider another person’s needs when I’m struggling to even meet my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add more context:\n",
      "\t•\tHe has a lot of close female friends, which logically I’m fine with (I have guy friends too), but it triggers some jealousy and insecurity from a previous relationship where that trust was broken.\n",
      "\t•\tMy first relationship was with someone who love-bombed me and ended up doing something deeply hurtful. My current boyfriend is nothing like him, but the similarities in affection and emotional intensity sometimes make me spiral with fear that it’ll all blow up the same way.\n",
      "\t•\tMy second relationship was with someone who barely showed he cared, so this current one is kind of the opposite—and I don’t know how to sit with it.\n",

We fell for each other very fast and had no one else to fall back on, we’ve been living together for about 3 years, and I always planned on asking her to marry me, and she wants the same.  But recently I’ve been finding myself and realizing all the things I want out of life.  I don’t want kids which is one of the main problems in our relationship, as we’ve talked about it multiple times since she wants kids but we both have kind of avoided the conversation and told each other that we’re too young to be worrying about that, we love each other very much and always figured we’d cross that bridge when we got there. \n",

I know I have one life and I want to make the absolute most of it, especially since my childhood was spent in a bubble my parents created as a Jehovah’s Witness, I left when I was 18, they took my car and I’ve been on my own since.

I don't have any problem at all with her having male friends at all, of course, I just feel bad because she may have lied to me when there was no need to. I don't want to confront her about this because I feel like it happened because of my jealousy in the past\n",

She was a bit silent about this trip afterwards and didn't show me photos, so I got a little bit weirded out. So here I messed up, I know, but I visited the Instagram profiles of some of her friends from that online movies community and it turns out they were all in that city in the same day. She isn't in any of those photos but it's a strange coincidence.\n",

It goes without saying that I'm perfectly ok with her having male friends.\n",

      "I don't want to confront her about this because  I don't want to be too jealous towards her again and I don't want to create any problem between us, and it's not my business to decide who she is friends with. I'm just a little bit hurt about her telling me a (potential) lie since I wasn't going to have any problem about her visiting another city with male and female friends she met online. I also don't want to confront her because she may have told me the truth and in that case there would be even more problems between us, last thing I want is to accuse her of lying when she didn't lie.\n",

The thing is I know I am being irrational but I can’t seem to keep all those bad thoughts away.

      "Body text: I am M/30 gf is F/22 we have been together 10 months. yes there's an age gap blah blah idc. Without disclosing too much information of hers she was in extremely abusive relationships ranging from family members all the way to her childs father who physically and emotionally abused her. Its been consistent her entire life. Shes grown to become very independent which is  awesome and I'm proud of her for that.  I'm a very affectionate man not necessarily just physically but I'll buy her cute little things I see that I think that she would like to put a smile on her face or just that simple little thing I think she would like it. In the 10 months of us being together ive spent about $1000 on different little gifts or things she expresses that she likes which I will go back and get for her etc etc. She expresses frustration that I dont argue with her, frustration about me buying her things because \"I can buy the things I want\" and I'm kind of at a loss at this point. I dont bring up the fact ever that I bought her items (her son's dad would throw it in her face so I simply don't mention it not to mention I do it just because i love her and I truly do just get her small things to make her smile) I don't argue even when she's actually upset I try to comfort her. My last relationship I was with my child's mother for 8 years and she was emotionally abusive so i can understand some of what she has been through. I guess I dont really know what my question is but...some days she's so loving and sweet and affectionate with me but at the drop of a coin she flips and makes me feel like she wants nothing to do with me. Im writing this after an entire day of us laughing and having fun we go our separate ways for the day and then her telling me randomly that she wants nothing from me and that she doesn't need me and can do everything on her own. I will try to tell her that I'm not going anywhere ( she has expressed concern that when she allows someone to get close and they leave the comfort she got from that person leaves with them) and that she can feel safe and be comfortable knowing I'm always going to walk side by side with her helping however I can. Again...I guess I dont really know what my question is beyond me wanting to be there for her and her asking why we're even together. That question being posed after I let her know the things she's asking me to change IE: buying her flowers, her favorite coffee, or little things I see I think she would like, letting her know I'm not going to leave her, reassuring her, telling her I love her. Is all part of who I am and how I show my love. She expresses she wants me to stop doing those things. I'm trying so hard for her and I feel like my efforts 50% of the time are just spit at. I dont want to lose her and I want to continue our relationship but the things she says sometimes are really starting to hurt me and when I let her know that she tells me to get over it. I love her very much and she says the same. How can I show her she's safe and okay loving me? How do I make it known to her I'm not leaving her? \n",

      "Title: My (M20) girlfriend (F25) and I have been together almost 2 years and she never initiates sex and would be happy having sex once a month.\n",
      "Body text: Now, I understand that the title may not make this post seem particularly unique, but I’ve been searching through this platform to find someone who shares my exact situation for advice or even just some level of relatability, but unfortunately, I haven’t been successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend is significantly older than me. While a five-year age gap may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, especially considering different life stages, it does feel substantial when it’s a quarter of my life. She doesn’t have an overly active sex drive and rarely initiates sexual encounters. She would be content with having sex once a month and has even expressed this sentiment, saying, “The sex is better when we haven’t had it in weeks.” On the other hand, I would prefer to have sex up to five times a week and could honestly have sex every day (I know, I know, it’s shocking for a 20-year-old male to want sex frequently).\n",
      "\n",
      "This disparity in our sexual desires discourages me because I’ve heard numerous stories about how sex frequency naturally declines as people age and relationships settle into a routine. Unfortunately, my situation is already at the very low end of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me share the unique (or at least to my knowledge) aspect of my situation. I can make my girlfriend finish 10+ times during sex. I also have no issue going down on her first and enjoy doing so. I will also use my fingers and can make her finish in 5 seconds if I so chose to do that. I can basically make her finish on command through any method and I honestly love making her finish more then I enjoy my own climax (not that I don’t enjoy my own). And trust me this isn’t because of her anatomy, before me, she has said she never finished with a partner through foreplay, oral, or sex. This is also why I don’t understand her statement “the sex is better when we wait a few weeks” because the sex for her is great regardless. I know sex isn’t all about orgasms it’s about connecting and being close, love, and trust. All of these things are present in our bedroom yet she doesn’t seem to want sex at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also not naive, she is not faking a single orgasm. I physically feel her entire body clench and pulsate so it’s not artificial and she is not the only woman I have been able to do this with so I know the most important part of sex she is receiving. We have talked about this issue of frequency and it never resolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t any huge stress in her life, I provide for her, I buy her gifts, I tell her she’s wonderful, I am patient, I am hygienic and above average attractive. I don’t know what could be barring her from desiring sex as much as me. She has no past sexual bad experiences in terms of trauma. She is comfortable with me in every aspect of life and we love each other. I want to marry this girl but this one single thing gets to me everytime I think about it. \n",

On one hand, he treats me well, he's very sweet, and has many wonderful qualities I love. On the other hand, he shows behaviours that have been bothering me for a long time, and which I keep forgiving.\n",

      "We are in a long-distance relationship due to my work. We live 190 miles apart and see each other a few times a month for a few days. I am a homebody and even a bit of a loner. I have always had space in my life only for a partner and family. I do not go to clubs, I do not hang out with girlfriends in bars or cafes, and I do not meet anyone except my family. Not because anyone expects that from me, but because that is just the kind of life I enjoy.\n",

      "In relationships, I am loyal, I do not seek attention, I do not post my photos online, I do not flirt, and I do not initiate contact with men. However, even in a relationship, I still notice interest from other men (whether at work, at the gym or even the street), but I handle every situation with distance and firmly set boundaries. In short, I have never given him any reason to be jealous. And yet, jealousy has been present since the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were times when he was jealous of people from work (even women despite the fact I've never had any interest in them), or a neighbour I said good morning to, or a mailman, or even a shop assistant I might have smiled at by accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to control what I eat, when I go to sleep, what I spend MY money on and who I talk to. He would ask me to immediately say who just messaged me, even if the phone was on the other side of the house, if he heard a sound going off. He clearly disliked it when I occasionally went to the gym. He would sulk if I did not call him right after work. (The grace period was always about 5 minutes, after that I knew he would react really bad)  \n",
      "He never accepted explanations like \"I had to stay a bit longer at the office\" or \"I had something to finish up.\" He would ask why it took so long, why I did not let him know earlier, or why I could not just finish my work at home. He got upset if I did not call during my work breaks, or if I called for just a few minutes instead of the full length of the break.\n",
      "\n",
      "I explained calmly, over and over again, that this behavior was not okay. He never yelled or made dramatic scenes, but he would push, he would dig, he would undermine. He used passive aggression and always denied doing so. Over time, I started losing patience. I no longer had the strength for these constant explanations. I started snapping, and then feeling guilty afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time we fought, I would pour my heart out, trying to explain what was wrong with his behavior, but he never seemed to understand. Only after I went silent for a day, after losing all of my patience, would he apologize and say he understood and would never do it again. But a few days later, the same thing would happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him to go to therapy. Not once, not twice, countless of times! He always avoided the topic. I, who used to be calm and balanced, turned into a ball of nerves. Eventually, even a simple question that hinted at control or jealousy would throw me off balance. I ended the relationship. But the heart wants what it wants. I lasted a few weeks. I came back with an ultimatum: therapy or a final breakup.\n",
      "\n",
      "He agreed. And at first, I was genuinely surprised, in a good way. I saw changes. I kept asking him to stay in therapy because I knew his problems ran deep. But after five months, he said he already understood everything, and therapy made no sense anymore. He also said it was too expensive and not worth the cost since he already understood it all. I could not force him, so I trusted him. I really wanted it to be the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we are at a point where, when things are good, it's really wonderful. But when something happens, it is a nightmare. His jealousy has calmed a bit, but the strange behavior has not gone away. It shows up in the most unexpected moments. It’s true, he is no longer jealous of every man I pass on the street, and he no longer reacts negatively when I go to the gym, nor do I have to call him during my lunch breaks, but he still shows behaviors I cannot understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, we were playing an online game just to kill time. I accidentally clicked something and started a 2.5 minute round with a random player. I apologized and asked him to wait a moment. He exploded. He said I did it on purpose and that I was distracted and didn’t really want to play with him, so I used it as an excuse. Absurd, I know, and so silly, I tried to explain, but it was for nothing. I lost it and hung up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, we were having a long phone call, we didn't talk about anything important, just \"spending time with each other\" and out of the sudden I got an important message. I asked for five minutes to reply. He knew what it was about and who it came from. He knew it was important to address it right away. It was 11 PM. He said I had no respect for him if I wanted to text someone during our conversation and added that it was not an hour when people should be messaging anyone anyway. Another argument, another round of explaining, another day of silence, and then apologies.  \n",
      "(For context, during these long calls, we usually multitask. One of us might clean, the other might scroll online or watch something. It’s typically very laid-back. That’s why his reaction caught me off guard, especially since our calls are usually so relaxed)\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I excitedly told him I wanted to join a theatre group as a hobby, which I could join 1-2 times per week. I expected support. He reacted coldly. He showed no support, said it was a stupid idea, a stupid hobby and told me I probably just wanted more activities so I would have less time for him. It seems like a small thing, but I haven't experienced any support from him if I ever speak about things that don't involve him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another time, I told him I was going on a business trip to a place I had always dreamed of visiting. His response was a cold \"Congratulations. What exactly am I supposed to be happy about?\". He needs to be involved in everything I do, otherwise he won't be happy for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also know that when I went to work and he stayed in my apartment, he looked through all of my stuff twice (especially my notes). He admitted it after being confronted, which bothers me now, because when I leave him alone I always wonder whether he does it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are countless examples like this. I cannot recall all of them because they have become part of daily life, but can give more if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part is that I live in constant tension. Before I say something to him, I analyze how he might react. I choose my words carefully so I do not trigger another unnecessary comment that will throw me off. I hate myself for snapping, but I just cannot take it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important thing to note is that he doesn't only act like this when we are long distance, when we stay at each other's places it's exactly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now comes the hardest part. This man meets most of my expectations. He treats me well, he is loyal, he has never shown any interest in other women. He always has time for me, and I know I am his priority. And I give just as much, or even more. I know he would walk through fire for me. I do not care about money, or some fancy job, or material things. I just want a peaceful, stable relationship and a family. And a truly loyal, committed man is unfortunately very rare. I know that, because I've gone through a couple of relationships before this one. I'm scared that if I leave him, I will find no one with the qualities I'm looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not the kind of person who gives up easily, but I feel like I am losing strength. I feel like I have gone from a cheerful person to someone gloomy and nervous. But I still love him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my question is simple: Do you think this can still be fixed? Can one live with this and somehow adapt? **Maybe I'm overreacting and relating all these recent behaviours to his behaviours pre- therapy, but they aren't as bad?** Or have I completely lost touch with reality? How do I stop snapping when I hear another ridiculous thing?\n",

      "Body text: I’ll try to keep this short. I (19) decided to drop off some stuff at my mom’s house, and I walked into my sisters (17) bedroom to say hi just to see her laying down with her ex (16). I seriously tried to keep my chill, but this guy literally got expelled from my high school because of their relationship. I blocked him on everything from her phone to keep them seperate. She always told me she would never get back with him, and always was grossed out by him. The fact she’s back with him after everything? She went to therapy because of him. He texted me that I’m a “faggot” and told me he would break my nose. I had to report him to the cops. This is absolutely unbelievable in my opinion. The fact that I haven’t even covered half of the stuff he’s done should show why this is crazy. I have no clue what to do. I’m going to just give up on her, she’s on her own with this one. But, since she’s my sister I genuinely have no clue what to do now. \n",

      "Body text: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been in a **very** happy, emotionally affirming relationship for almost a year.

      "\n",
      "I realized he’s great at expressing all his *positive* emotions, but when it comes to confrontation or processing *negative* stuff, he just shuts down. The actual argument started because he said a “joke” over text that really crossed a line. I told him how it hurt me, and while he *did* apologize, his responses gave off “let’s just move on” energy. He was also taking 30 mins to an hour to respond while I was trying to actually talk it through.\n",
      "\n",
      "This avoidant behavior kept up until we finally called the next day. He was really defensive at first, until he admitted that he’s just “not good at articulating himself” and his first instinct was to not think about things at all. I had a long convo with him about how we can’t just push emotionally heavy stuff aside. I also told him that sometimes it feels like he treats me like a “guy friend” as we both have more traditionally masculine hobbies and that he needs to start recognizing the difference between me being his best friend and me being his *partner* when we’re having disagreements.  \n",

Throughout the conversation he said things like \"he's just learned to not linger too much on it\" and how this carries over to other parts of his life. ie. how he doesn't really tell his friends really anything about things that bother him (unrelated to his home life).   \n",

      "We had this moment where I said something like, “I’ve been in therapy for 3 years, and I’ve genuinely learned to love myself.” And he responded with “I don’t really like myself.” I asked him if he wanted to explain why, and he just said “not really.”\n",

I want to stay and have my own kids after marriage. He is M40. I am F33. Im back and fourth with myself a lot on whether I can be fully accepting of the situation. I like his kids and ex wife. The problem is that it takes away from me. The money is tied up in them, we can't pick up and go. I do not always want them included in every little thing. When we get a place, I will be sharing my finances space and life with 3 kids that are not mine. Its doable but so is starting over with someone else who has not been married or had kids. If your heart is involved, how can you decide to leave? Part of me wants to stay cause it's not that bad. But the other part feels like she's missing out and wants to part ways. It will be painful but doable as well. I also believe that the partner needs to come first as much as the kids do. It should be their mother but she has a new life now and they didn't work out. But if the only true way to mean as much to somebody is to be there before kids then im not sure I agree with this. I believe your life partner is a love your kids can't give you and should be valued just as much as someone values their children. They are 3 teenagers. How would you come to a decision?\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi everyone. I have trouble bringing things up that may cause an issue but I think it's time. My boyfriend  is just a highly critical/judgmental & negative person when it comes to others. He's bothered by the way people look at him in public, the way people dress/look physically, people's personal choices as far as beliefs & personal choices, everything. Early in our relationship we did have quite a few discussions about his views & it seems that he took what I said into consideration & was open to me educating him on things. I do not think I changed his views completely, but he at least does not make ignorant comments (as much) anymore. I hate to think that he's just censoring his self around me. I like for people to feel like they can be themselves. \n",

      "We also have 1 child each & the kids have been spending more time together with us. I notice that his daughter is like a mini him. It's annoying hearing the things they have to say & I definitely do not like telling people about their child. However, I think it's time to have more discussions because he's been hinting at wanting to move in together (not anytime soon).\n",

      "The main things sparing him in this relationship are that his critical & judgmental ways are never directed at me, he holds me in a very high regard.

I'm nervous about having tough conversations because 1) they are extremely difficult for me in relationships. 2) I worry that he's going to be confused about why I didn't express things more openly this entire time. How can I let him know that his critical ways are exhausting & annoying? Thank you in advance<3\n",

      "Body text: Hi everyone! This is going to be a mouthful but here I go…\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I have been together for 2 years now but we dated in high school for 3 years. I know his family in and out and when I was younger, I liked his mother because she was the “cool mom” but even then I disagreed with who she was as a person and her parenting style but I was a teenager so I never thought too deeply to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward, I am 24, my partner 25 and I hate this woman… for the way she treated my partner and his brother and the pain she caused them due to her alcoholism, poor relationships with men, lack of financial literacy and overall loud, narcissistic personality. They grew up without fathers, raised by their grandmother while she chased men and got drunk every weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "My partner left to go and work overseas last year and everything has gone to shit since then. He had to leave his younger brother here and he is like a father to him. Since then, his brother has become angrier, depressed and desperately needs therapy because he’s resorted to smoking w**d and using x*nax to cope with the issues of dealing with his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before his brother went down this road,  I was the one who tried to push for him to go to therapy. His mother made the entire conversation about herself, belittled him and then afterwards told me that she doesn’t want him to go to therapy because he will realise that he hates her. Funny enough, he already hates her and is dishing her a fat plate of rudeness, arguments and chaos to her, which i feel is a direct consequence for her neglect as a parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation with his brother saddens me greatly as I grew up with this little boy. I’ve been protecting him since I was a teenager, I was 16 yet I removed him from his mother’s company when she got too drunk and to this day, I try everything that I can possibly do to protect him and keep his interests alive, yet it feels I am watching his potential and happiness deplete day by day from being in the same environment as his mother. I’ve witnessed my partners mother berate him, get drunk and argue with him, allow him to be around grown ups who are drunk and swearing, fighting… she’s brought so many men around him and when they leave her, she blames him… this is only the half of it\n",
      "\n",
      "His teenage brother has now decided, he will be moving overseas to live with us (once I eventually immigrate and when he turns 18)… I love this child and I want the best for him but I can’t help but think it’s unfair that he has a fully capable mother who CAN look after him but my partner and I will assume this responsibility. Nonetheless my partner and I have agreed this will be best for him so it is part of our plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this has happened and my partner still sees his mother in an enduring light. It’s as if he makes excuses for her, saying she’s broken, unhappy and she just needs to stop drinking to fix all of this. I heavily disagree, I believe she has had little to no responsibility for these boys and she’s neglected them for her own pursuits in life… I don’t tell him that though\n",
      "\n",
      "But In February, I told my partner that enough is enough… I will no longer be visiting his mother and that I do not agree with her and how she has neglected his brother and that I am deeply concerned about his behaviour. Since then, his brother has become 100x worse and his mother has done nothing about it. The issue is, my partner still comes to speak to me about everything that is going on and I try my best to listen and support him but at the time time, I cannot control the fucking disgust and anger I have towards his mother. Lately when I’ve started to disagree with him, he has said that I am argumentative and combative when he talks about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my eyes, I’m not trying to be. I’m simply questioning his reality and views and bringing a different perspective to the table, while still trying my best to make my partner feel safe and comfortable to talk to me. At the same time, I understand this is a complex family dynamic but it hurts me to see the part my partner plays in his own suffering, by covering up for someone who continuously hurts him and his family… I believe seeing her as the real villain that she is would set him free but it’s not my place to enforce that.\n",

I just don’t know if that is normal in early relationships or if i’m just a pleasure tool.

      "Body text: I've been together with him for a year, but some of the things he say give me pause on this relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of things he's said that give me serious pause about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to retire in 5 years\" - When I told him I don't want to be with someone who retires young (my father did, ended up sitting on the couch drinking beer/watching tv until my mother divorced him) he got very defensive, said he wants to start his own company, or just take an easier job (which he has in the past, multiple times), and \"who do I think he is\" (to be fair, I've not been working the past year while he has consistently been employed and successful since teen years). \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just have this job, for now\" - When I introduced him to my parents/friends he downplays his job to the extreme, says he does 'boring stuff with computers'....He makes 400k/year doing difficult programming for a famous company. He'll say things like he may want to do something completely different in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care how I look\" - His clothing choices are.... suspect at best. None of it is dirty, but he has lots of corporate t-shirts, sweatpants, and other such things. Some of his socks have holes in them. I want him to put as much effort into how he looks for me as I put in for him, but he just tells me to throw out his shirts that I don't like. His hair is also unshaped typically. OTOH he is a very avid gym goer and probably has the best body of any man I've ever dated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe in hard work\" - I \\*want\\* a hard working partner. I know he works hard, as I see him but he continues to say that hard work isn't worth it, and to work smarter not harder. I want a hard wroking partner who will always make sure we have a safe and secure future....and with him it just doesn't feel that way\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure what to do.... He seems to get quite defensive when I bring up any of these issues, and I feel like I can't even talk to him about them because he makes \\*me\\* feel bad for even bringing them up. If he's not defensive he'll just brush them off in a dismissive way... like \"yeah, whatever\" type of thing\n",

      "  \n",
      "TL;DR: My boyfriend says off the wall stuff, and then can't discuss them with me without being frustrated/defensive... what should I do? Is this relationship worth it? I have more traditional values and want someone who puts as much care into their appearance as I put into mine. \n",

We have started living together in February and things have been going great, obviously an augment every now and then. Anyways i recently started to do minor petty things in our relationship when he pisses me off Example - we got into an argument the night before, i told him not to come to bed and sleep downstairs (i locked the master bedroom door) Anyways we were baby sitting my brothers puppy and in the morning i hopped up to let her to do business after an hour I forced him to wake up by putting the puppy on him while he was sleeping, this did not work so I jumped into spare bed and cuddled him until he woke up then obviously he proceeded to ignore me when he woke up. Which is to be expected\n",

I put in good effort for the occasion- I got him three gifts that totaled about $325 and all correlated to his most current hobbies (a cool monster hunter figure imported from japan, merch from his favorite sports team, a glass guitar slide).

He seemed upset, I realized my mistake, and I quickly changed topics. But he clearly was still upset.

      "Body text: My bf has a younger sister who, I'll be honest, I'm not very fond of. I think you may understand why after reading the entire post.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is still in college. She kept telling her parents and my bf its because she does sports and had to push back her exams, which sounded pretty sus to me but her family accepted the story and I didn't want to cross any boundaries. Her parents fund her degree and they have been taking her word at face value and paying her tuition all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, she had approached her parents and my bf and started bawling. Turns out, she has actually been failing her first year for 7 years straight and hasn't paid her tuition for three years and her college is now threatening to throw her out after years of multiple warnings. When my bf asked where all the money went, she said she used it to travel. She goes to Bali twice a year, lives a very luxurious and expensive lifestyle (she's an aspiring influencer) and lied to her family saying it was from her own money. Turns out, she didn't have a job or any money and just blew her tuition fee on expensive things.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has then asked her parents to give her an allowance (because she's broke and \"couldn't keep living like this\") and for them to pay off all her college arrears. She had then threatened to hurt herself if they didn't do this.\n",

His sister always expects him to pitch in fix her fuck ups. She totaled her car driving drunk twice, and she demanded that he fix it for her both times. And he just...did it. She makes him by her designer stuff he cant afford...and again....he just does it. She is a very entitled and self centered person and my bf and his family enables her behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brushed this off for 3 years now. I always believed it was not my place to comment on their relationship. Their family and I need to know my place. And honestly, my bf is the sweetest, kindest and most loving guy I've met. I value him and cherish him a lot. But the fact that this keeps happening regularly is worrying me. I feel like he doesn't know how to draw boundaries with her and one day, if we get married, he will bankrupt the two of us and our family trying to help her. I initially thought this may be an overreaction but the more and more I see this happening, the more I believe that it is completely possible. I have tried bringing this up with him but he is very protective of his sister and the conversations haven't really gone anywhere.\n",

      "Title: My bf [25M] refuses to marry me [22F] until we’re in our 50’s. I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Body text: I’ve been with my boyfriend now for little over a year. But we ‘dated’ for about a year before becoming official. As the years have passed obviously conversations have popped up such as: what are both our thoughts on having children? when might be the appropriate length of time to move in together? And finally: marriage. We are both in this relationship for the long run, neither of us have ever dated casually and were only looking for long term relationships when we met. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 6 months ago, the topic of marriage got brought up for the first time. Not because either of us want to get married now, but because I hope to one day get married in the future (next 10 years). My bf responded by saying something along the lines of: “only when I’m in my 50’s or later”, I thought he was joking, I really believed he was pulling my leg, until he made it really clear that he was being deadly serious. I was a little upset, but I wanted to understand why. His reasoning for doing so was because: he didn’t want to conform to “societies norms”, he said too many people “play by the book” and he believes people should break that, that our love shouldn’t be defined by a legally binding contract and that after people marry it all goes down hill from there. I explained that I didn’t view marriage that way, that I viewed marriage as two people making eternal promises to one another and that making vows and sharing a day where we can celebrate our relationship is very important to me (and of course ever since I was a little girl I’ve always fantasised about the dress and the ring). He replied with “if it’s a day you want I’ll throw you a party, I’ll get you a ring so you can tell people we’re married, but I’m not getting married until late”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this conversation we have had the same discussion about 5 times over the last 6 months. I always end up burying my head in the sand and hoping that by the next time he has changed his opinion, even if it’s only a little. But nothing has changed and he is very set on his opinion. I’ve even spoken to my mother and stepfather about it, who themselves didn’t marry until they were both 55, and they say it’s “just an age thing, he’ll grow out of it in the next 5 years”. But I don’t know if I can see that happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t understand why he’s being so so stubborn about it being so late in life. He still says he wants to marry, just not until then. Other information I do feel is important to add is that his parents are divorced (so are mine), and divorced when he was 17, from what I know it was quite a turbulent split and his mother claims she left it later than she should’ve. Other than that our relationship is strong, arguments are rare and I’m very close with his family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do love him very dearly, and I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but this is something I’ve always wanted to fulfil in my life and something I believe is a very important aspect of a relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of staying with him for the rest of my life and never getting married has crossed my mind, I don’t want to be bitter or resentful in 30 years time because he deprived me of being able to marry while I get to watch all of my friends and family get married. But the thought of leaving him to find someone who can give me these things and living without him is just as bitter. \n",

I don’t know how I’ll be able to reply without getting really upset so I guess this is my reply. I feel incredibly insecure and honestly too embarrassed to reply to a lot of the comments here. So to those who do just want the best outcome for me I really appreciate your heartfelt advice and time. Thanks to everyone for your input, I never expected to get so many comments. \n",

      "Body text: UPDATE: A conversation last night pretty much confirmed my suspicion that he's planning to force a move when his mom visits next month. He has asked me to empty our storage unit before she arrives \"to prove to her that we are okay\" which makes zero sense.

My husband wants to go and I do not. It’s ruining our relationship. What rights do I have if I do not want to move my family across the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief history. MIL and I had a good relationship until we moved out of state after 6 years. She cut contact with my Husband for many months and it took years for them to establish a relationship again. During that time we got married, had a baby, and she still refused contact with me because I \"took her baby\" from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was 4 years ago. She lost her brother a few months ago and he was the last of her family. She doesn't have familial relationships with anyone except a very distant relationship with her brother's 2 kids. This is by her doing. She has largely cut her other son out of her life because she doesn't like his new girlfriend and feels she is taking him from her (sounds familiar). So suddenly she is reaching very intensely out of the blue to establish a relationship with me and my daughter who she has had no contact with her entire life. Never sent a gift or a card or called to talk to her (she's 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she is saying she wants us to come live with her. We are 1800 miles apart. She wants us to live with her until we find work and a home near her. To me, it feels like she's grasping at the last shred of family she has left realizing that she has no one else. She is enchanting my husband with how magical this will be. She will babysit, buy all our food, cook for us, give us date nights whenever we want, we can live in her 10 acres and have lots of space for our two kids and our dogs. It all sounds great except.. we live here. Our jobs are here. Our life and all our kids have ever known is here. There is no reason to leave other than her suddenly deciding this is what needs to happen. She literally went from not talking to me for 4 years to texting me \"I love you\" every day and telling me how she's getting her house ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing a HUGE problem between my husband and I because he LOVES this idea but before this we were happy living where we are. We have goals and plans that are based here. One of our kids is in school here, I'm in college here, we have a good program here that allows anyone to get a free degree up to a bachelors. I can finish school without owing any money. There are many reasons I want to stay where we are. The same reasons we chose to live here in the first place. But now my husband is caving under this delusion of a beautiful carefree life with his mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to resolve this. I'm not moving my family across the country on a whim just because my MIL decided she's lonely and he's set that it would be great for our family. She is set to visit for the first time next month after saying for YEARS she would NEVER come here and previously said she would come up to help us move everything in with her. I kind of feel like they are planning to twist my arm when she is here and try to force moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I protect myself from this and also keep a good relationship with my husband? I don't even know what my legal rights are if he were to say we're moving and I don't want to.\n",

      "\n",
      "TL; DR - My (46F) BF (49M) has a decades-long friendship with a woman friend (47F) who has been unpleasant towards me and who isn't interested in getting to know me. They went out to dinner alone, and I didn't like what he reported back about how it went. We discussed how to handle it; I wasn't comfortable with the resolution until yesterday when we clarified some things. It turns out he had already taken many steps to distance himself from her and is fully committed to making sure all of his friends treat me respectfully.\n",

      "I had a long chat with BF yesterday. I am feeling fine now. I had made some incorrect assumptions and misunderstood a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "1 - He had already resolved to refuse any one-on-one invites from her. At the end of our last discussion, he'd said he wasn't sure what he would say to her. I thought that meant he wasn't sure if he would turn her down or not. He actually just meant he wasn't sure how he would phrase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 - I assumed they were in closer touch over text than is true. After the dinner last year, I told him that I'd prefer him not to go out with her alone but that I didn't expect him to completely end the friendship and that remaining in contact was fine as long as it was appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that he had not initiated a single text to her since their dinner last year after I expressed concern. She has texted him maybe 5 times in the past year, all very benign and appropriate, like \"Happy birthday\" or \"I heard your uncle passed away; condolences.\" He responded to each with polite but very short messages \"Thank you. Hope you're well.\" No phone calls or other forms of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that they'd been slightly drifting apart before we met anyway, so he decided to steer things in the direction of drifting even further out of contact since it was creating an issue for us. He was prepared to be more confrontational if she got inappropriate again but was happy to find that it wasn't necessary. As mentioned in the original post, they have many many overlapping friend and family links so it would be preferable not to have a dramatic rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - I assumed they were bumping into each other at group events with some frequency. It turns out she hasn't been able to attend any of the same events that he has. The last time they actually saw each other was in fact that dinner last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that I was avoiding asking for details about how often they were in contact as a way to cope with my discomfort without being too controlling. I can be a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\" so I was doing well in not letting it bother me until I saw her name pop up in a recent text, right after one of those events that I'd assumed he'd seen her at. We decided that going forward, he will proactively tell me anytime he has even incidental contact with her so that I can assume nothing is happening if I don't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a long discussion about respect in general. He is totally willing to drop any friends who are disrespectful to me or our relationship. We also discussed what appropriate behaviors look like; I think he has a much better awareness now. I asked him to think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was out alone with a male friend, and he was a fly on the wall, would be happy to hear us discussing sex or hear the other guy make even borderline disparaging remarks about him? He admitted that he would not, and he will adhere to the same standard going forward with any female friends.\n",

      "Finally, he said he's willing to refuse any other one-on-one invitations from women who don't want to include me and to drop the friendship if they are pushy about it. Luckily this isn't likely to be a big issue, as I have met and really like most of his female friends, and the ones who live far away and haven't visited yet have already said that they're eager to meet me as soon as we can.\n",

      "All in all I currently feel a little silly for having worked myself up so much over a woman that he's seen once and exchanged about 20 words of text with in the past 18 months. But relieved that it's resolved. And I learned that the \"out of site out of mind\" tactic is not a good long-term fix for me; if something is bugging me, I need to go ahead and ask about it.\n",

      "I’m dating someone who is amazing to me on all platforms. Everyone deserves to feel this type of undevoted love and commitment. But there’s something that I can’t get past— his drinking. And it sucks because he is not a mean drunk, abusive, nothing. He just drinks too much and too often. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have approached him about it before as I have childhood trauma from alcohol abuse and it’s also just something that is not attractive. We have that conversation twice. He got sober for about 2 weeks and then went back into drinking. I justified it as it’s not hard alcohol, but I told him he can’t just have one drink. He realized it and did better, but it just never stuck. Now, it’s the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned this and I haven’t been able to separate from him since he wasn’t in the states cause he went on a family vacation. \n",
      "\n",
      "His family told him a while back he drinks too much and they were concerned. He knew they were disappointed but nothing seemed to get through to him. Finally, we start dating and 2 months in was the first time I approached the drinking issue. And then the back n fourth of sobriety or cooling it on drinking. He lost 12 lbs from that only. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward- I met his family and his parents thanked me that I helped him cool down on the alcohol. How are they see the love he has and the work he is putting in. But his mom pulled me aside and something along the lines of “I know you love each other but please always remember yourself if it becomes too much”. And that hit. This was back in March. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went on my vacation for my bday 2 ish weeks ago, let’s just say… I was annoyed. On the second to last night, we all went in another country. I knew he was drinking by himself while doing a chores as I always clock when he has been drinking and not telling me. So that next day, he was SEVERELY hungover to where he was shaking, cold shivers, feeling nauseous, etc. at that point, I didn’t feel an ounce of emotion as I was already fed up. Decided I’ll talk to him once we get back to the states. Mind you, not admitting he drank heavily by himself all day. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’m just here to vent. To remind myself that I’m doing the right thing. To express I have so much love for him, he does anything and everything for me without a second guess.. I’m just hurt trying to compartmentalize it all. I feel like the bad guy for doing this for myself. I want him to better himself but this was an issue I’ve dealt with him 2 months in. He’s not a bad person, I do want a future with him, I just need to take a step away as the drinking issue is truly hurting me.  \n",

      "\n",
      "My (29F) boyfriend (28M) often makes snide remarks about how my family supports me financially, and calls me privileged for it. We've been together for 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an only child, my family isn't rich but we share what we have with each other. Before my current boyfriend, I was with an ex that painted himself as a good guy up until I moved across the country with him and he isolated me, abused me, stole all my money, and knocked me up. I have a 2 year old daughter with him, but I was able to escape the situation when I was 5 months pregnant. My parents bought my plane ticket home and welcomed me with open arms. They assumed full financial responsibility for my child and I so that I could be a stay at home mom on top of healing from the trauma and going back to college to finish up my degrees and work when I'm ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend comes from an affluent family; however, his father passed away 2 years ago, and he was the sole breadwinner for the family. It turned his family's life upside down, his mother is now living off of money lent from other family members and social security as she's in her 70s and can't work. He works under the table at a place that doesn't pay hourly, it's based on commissions. He's there for 10+ hours some days but if there's no customers, he doesn't get paid a penny. On a good day, he'll make about $70, but that's so disproportionate to what he should be making for that amount of time worked (we're in CA). He's really angry about not having much money, but also refuses to look for another job out of loyalty to his boss who's also his friend. He's always upset about being late on payments as well as his mom asking him for money. I feel bad for him and I try to be as understanding as I can, I know he's under a lot of stress financially, and I never ask him for anything or expect anything from him. Just his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he's been making more and more jabs at me about being \"Miss Privileged\" for taking handouts from my parents and not having to work while he works 5 days a week and is still struggling to make ends meet. All my parents help me with is my $25 a month phone bill and food and clothes from the thrift store for my daughter. I left everything I had when I left my ex and came home to my parents and live minimalistically, but my boyfriend had many payments he's responsible for (car, phone, credit card, student loans, helping his mom, etc). I'm trying to be empathetic towards him and I know he has it much harder than me, but there's nothing I can do about it and I don't think I should be ashamed for having a family that takes care of me when I'm down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a way to navigate this and put an end to this weird, idk, jealousy? I feel that the only way he'll be happy is if I struggle alongside him, but I don't want to or need to do that.\n",

      "TL;DR: my boyfriend is mad that my parents financially support me while he's struggling to make ends meet while working a dead end job and doesn't get any help from his own family.\n",

      "Body text: \n",
      "TLDR; My boyfriend is a great partner in practical ways (helpful, supportive, kind in actions) but struggles with emotional reassurance. He rarely gives verbal/physical affection, shuts down when I’m upset, and gets frustrated when I ask if he’s mad (he has a neutral face that looks angry). I have anxious tendencies and crave more emotional connection, which he feels is too much. He thinks my anxiety is the main problem, but I’m wondering if we’re just emotionally incompatible. Sometimes I feel like he hates me but I think that's all in my head. I'm not sure what to do\n",

      "I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, living together for 3 months. He’s genuinely a good partner in many ways. He helps around the house, supports us financially, remembers little details about me, and is always down to do activities I suggest. He’s not controlling, doesn’t mind when I go out with friends/family, and shows his care through actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But emotionally, I struggle. He doesn’t express affection verbally much (rarely says “I love you” or compliments), and when I’m upset or crying, he tends to shut down. He says he doesn’t want to say “I love you” too often ot compliments me because it loses its value. Or feels like I'll just keep asking for more if he gives me what I need. So he'd rather leave it as is so I don't end up asking him to say those words more frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s not big on physical comfort either, especially when he’s annoyed. When I ask him for reassurance like a hug or kind words, he usually doesn’t respond or changes the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also has a very neutral resting face that looks pissed off to me, which triggers my anxiety. I tend to ask, “Are you mad?” or “Is something wrong?” often. He says he’s fine, but then gets frustrated that I keep asking. He feels like I’m accusing him of being mad when he’s not, and it leads to tension. This has happened enough times that he feels we’re having the same tiring conversation over and over. Sometimes I feel like he hates me with the way he reacts or talks to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, he even chose to sleep on the couch, saying maybe if he acts like he doesn’t care, I’ll realize what “not caring” actually looks like, because he feels my constant questioning implies he doesn’t care.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thinks my anxiety is the root cause of our issues and has suggested medication. I’m open to working on myself and I’ve told him I’m willing to go to therapy. But I also wonder if we’re just emotionally mismatched in terms of needs and expression.\n",

      "Body text: I have been with my partner for 8 years. When we first met we both worked in construction. We started dating. I got a little burnt out in construction and decided to go back to school and became a nurse (best decision ive ever made, i love my job). Then he decided to go back to school. After two years he dropped out. He worked a p/t job in retail for just under half a year and then went back to construction for a year and a half. While working construction again he was reminded of how taxing it is on his body and how he can't stay in that field. He recently went for surgery and is still healing. He wants to start his own business doing odd jobs and selling art. He doesn't want to work for someone else.   \n",

      "When he started working construction again, he was making a decent wage and could actually start saving money and pay off his debt. We started planning to start a family.

Anyway, I was on FaceTime with my bf earlier,.  he’s in Spain on a solo trip and he was with 2 friends, they’re drunk. His friends were very nice, but after I said a comment to him, he told me “shut the fuck up” and “don’t look at me like that” to which I was shocked by. They were both said in a joking tone, not mean. He has said something like that to me one other time a few months ago and i immediately told him to never speak to me like that. He apologized and hasn’t since then. I think it was him being drunk and with his friends and wanting to impress them or whatever. I will mention it to him and hope it doesn’t happen again, but I’m afraid this is just him showing true colors while drunk.

      "Body text: I 'F26' married to 'M27' recently got married about a year and half ago. He recently had his birthday and was overwhelmed by the amount of greetings that he had of what a great person he is. Basically it made him guilty. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context we had a rough patch at the start of our marriage because I was so insecure about his exes because he told me about them too much when we were dating, he told me they broke up because it was a mutual understanding because they did not love each other anymore, so I was paranoid because we had dated only a short while after they broke up and got married 6 months after fast-forward to now he confessed that he had lied to me about the reason why, it turns out he cheated on both his exes and his recent one with the one prior and then cheated on the recent one with someone he met on a business trip. I asked him why he didn't tell me he said it was because he knew I loathed cheaters and I wouldn't marry him if I knew he was one (My dad cheated on my mom, which my mom still doesn't know about and I don't have the heart to tell her). \n",

I don't really know whether to believe that that was it, but now I'm stuck because he took off to his friends house because he said he couldn't face me. I don't know what to do moving forward, I want to try to mend things but I don't know how we can manage if he keeps running away from me and I just end up feeling like I'm chasing after a dead end. I guess I'm insecure of being divorced because it's frowned upon where I grew up. Sorry this is long I guess I just need to vent because he won't come home and doesn't want to talk to me.

I lost my closest friend trying to “keep the peace.” He accuses me of encouraging male attention. He even accused me of cheating for visiting my childhood friend before he moved abroad.

      "At the start, he seemed like a genuinely sweet guy. He is very chivalrous, his affection and romantic gestures were endearing. He was always on the lookout for me, and doing everything to make me feel special. I felt protected, and especially in residency having someone on ur side feels great. But over time, it became too much. He constantly bombarded me with affection and love, and it was overwhelming. I’m just not a super affectionate person, and he knows it. \n",

      "People involved:\n",
      "Me (46F), my boyfriend (49M); his friend (47F)\n",
      "\n",
      "Situation:\n",
      "I have been with my boyfriend for 2+ years. We do not live together because our children from our previous marriages are still at home. We may move in together in a few years after they all leave for college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having met later in life, of course we both come into the relationship with lots of pre-existing friendships. Many of them have melded seamlessly, but there are some obstacles, especially with relationships on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my case, most of my friends were really my friends and not “friends of the marriage” - so he’s pretty much fully integrated into my social life. All of my friends have accepted him warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his case, he has a few friends who are equally good friends with him and his ex-wife and are trying to maintain a relationship with both. There are two women in particular who are slightly closer to his ex-wife than they are to him. They are both still his friends, but have said that they don’t want to hang out with me at all because that feels disloyal to his ex-wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one woman I don’t have so much of a problem with because he only sees her when he is with her entire family, including her husband and kids. I mean, it doesn’t feel great to be excluded, but I understand that it’s about his kids’ relationship with her kids as much as anything else so I can live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other woman really grinds my gears. She wants to hang out with him one on one. They went out for a late dinner at a nice restaurant last year for example, and he said that I couldn’t come because she wouldn’t feel comfortable with it. I told him that was fine, but I don’t feel comfortable with this kind of thing occurring regularly with her unless she is willing to include me at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other nuance to this is that I’ve actually known her for many years because their kids went to grade school in middle school together. She was always very rude and dismissive to me. She is a wealthy, fancy person and really seems to spend a lot of time on her appearance. I am a bit plainer by choice. I always had the impression that she thought I was too frumpy and homely to be in her friend group. Interestingly, I mentioned this to my boyfriend and said that I was maybe mistaken in my impression and reading her signals wrong — and he said probably not; that’s kind of how she is!! \n",
      "\n",
      "When they went out and he told her we were together, she claimed that she had no idea who I was, and had never met me as far as she could remember, that my name didn’t even ring a bell. To me this is either a lie to make me seem unimportant or it’s the truth and she was really so dismissive with me that I made no impression on her despite having met her 30 or 40 times over the course of a decade. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn’t like that when he told her we were dating and showed her a picture of me, she said “oh that doesn’t seem like your type; I thought you would go for someone based on more superficial qualities.” His interpretation was that somehow this was a compliment implying that I was more of a natural beauty and not over processed… given my history with her. I feel like it was more like she wanted to tell him that I’m homely but knew she couldn’t get away with just saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also told him she was disappointed that he was committing himself to a monogamous relationship because in her view, humans aren’t meant to be monogamous and that he would have more fun sleeping around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say I don’t think either of them actually have any intention of hooking up. I do believe that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will also say that he has been scrupulously honest. If he wanted to hook up with her, it would be incredibly easy for him to do since we don’t live together or keep tabs on each other. He could have chosen not to mention meeting with her or could have chosen to edit his recap of their dinner in a less incriminating way. I am grateful for the honesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what I’m struggling to get him to understand is that even if I 100% trust him not to do anything with her, the whole situation still feels disrespectful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seems to somewhat understand, but we’re kind of an impasse of what to do next. He has agreed that next time she brings up getting together he will try to steer it towards a group situation that includes me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But my question is, what if she says no — I just want some time alone with you to talk about personal things? \n",
      "\n",
      "We are confused about how to handle it… \n",
      "Honestly, it would feel a little humiliating to me if he told her that he wasn’t allowed to go out to dinner with her alone because I don’t like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome desired:\n",
      "Figure out what he could say to her if she tries to insist on dinner alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn’t want to completely lose his friendship with her or make it too awkward. I don’t like the idea of them going out alone again, but I also don’t like the idea of him admitting that I’m the reason that he’s not doing it. I feel like it makes me look insecure or pathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR\n",
      "My boyfriend has a female friend that wants to maintain a friendly relationship with him that excludes me completely. I feel disrespected. How can he set a boundary without losing her friendship or exposing my insecurities?\n",

      "Body text: Hi all, \n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, my gf and I have been dating for two and a half years. She is 30 and im 26. We have never had a “good time” in our relationship. In the beginning stages, I was still living with my homophobic family and in nursing school, I let her know it would not be easy and school is a priority, she agreed. However our relationship became so strained she asked me to move in, once I decided to tell my parents and move in, she said she would be scared to cheat on me and wanted to be honest. So we broke up This has happened three times, each time we got back together, i would get incredibly anxious she would do it again I would start fights and need to figure out if she would leave me again. each time we broke up, she would date someone new in a week. I have a huge abandonment wound from this and each time she asked for me back, I would hound her with questions, ask every other second if she loved me, and would accuse her of leaving me again. It caused so many fights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently we have been together and it’s been nothing but fights since December. I feel awful she broke last month and said she feels like a shell of a human, I told her we can still work past this. My brother just recently got diagnosed with cancer, so naturally I feel emotionally vulnerable, yet she has still stayed. It completely wiped away the past of her leaving me when I needed her most. But is now saying I drain her energy, she has no good memories to hold onto, and she wants to break up but has not officially decided yet and waiting to see if the feeling goes away. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the root of the problem was needing to know she would not abandon me again like previous times and she does truly care. I now know she does, how can I reverse it and not drain her energy. I love her more than anything and the pain of the past definitely took a toll on us. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: my gf says I drain her energy but we just had a break through that broke the toxic cycle. How can we repair ? \n",

      "Title: I (32M) need to figure out what to do about my almost sexless 6 years relationship with my girlfriend (26F).\n",
      "Body text: TL;DR: Basically, I have a relationship with a girl that I like a lot; we have a very satisfying romantic life, but sex is almost always a problem. I have to initiate every time, and even when it gets going (once per month or less) the experience we have is kinda passionless and very clunky, for lack of a better word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry in advance if there’s some kink with my English, it‘s not my native language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the deal, and it’s a thing that’s been driving me insane for years: I love my girlfriend with all my heart, and she loves me back the same way, but she’s not interested in having an active sexual life with me, and for sure she’s not capable or not willing to initiate any sexual intercourse with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not that we haven’t discussed the problem through the years: the conversation always started from me, and she’s always reluctant to talk about it (she’s not much for difficult psychological and emotional matters and she’s kinds shy). And through the years she gave many different reasons for her apparent disinterest in sex (or in sex with me). Most importantly, that she never was that interested in the thing in the first place (even though in the beginning she was the one pestering me because we weren’t having enough moments of physical intimacy), but also she talked about me not being 100% her type, e.g. she would like for me to have a more athletic, even muscular body, while I’m more of a chubby guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem is (and trust me, I’m not really bragging or anything here, I’m just trying to be as honest as possible) that I’m not at all an ugly dude: I’m very confident, I know how to fascinate a girl and I’ve had many occasions to be flirtatious with others -even unfaithful- but I’ve never been able to act upon them, because I’m just not that kind of person. God knows how hard it has been, with sexual satisfaction coming my way once a month or even less, and always under my solicitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not to say that our feelings for each other aren’t the real deal and that’s what makes me feel so bad about this. When everything clicks in it’s place the times we spend together are amazing. Also, she’s always managed to push me out of my comfort zone and to bring out the best part of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s just that… having basically no sexual life sometimes really hurts. I’m not at all an hyper-sexual guy, and in my mind it feels at times kinda base and petty to make such a big deal about sex, when everything else works well. But you know, what makes this even more aggravating is the fact that having to always initiate any moment of intimacy, and then seeing her mostly interested in having her needs satisfied, while being kinda not interested, or awkward and detached when it comes to my part of the deal… makes for a very miserable experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that’s the gist of it. What should I do? Anybody has any advice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Final edit:\n",
      "Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. You made me reflect upon my situation in all the ways that mattered. This was exactly what I needed: a very quick and effective therapy session from the web with some hard truths in it and some gentle encouragement in there as well!\n",

I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer\n",
    "\n",
    "I was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it's a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he's about 13, maybe 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tell him that I have to pat that area down. He's a little nervous, I figure that because he's so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn't look chubby at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "I move to the right side of the chest, read what's on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He's not wearing sweatpants, \\*she\\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn't even know the couple that just came through.\n",
    "\n",
    "I look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.\n",
    "\n",
    "I immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what's wrong, and I explain the situation to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "My supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she's trying not to laugh.\n",
    "\n",
    "She takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it's fine, that it wasn't the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.\n",
    "\n",
    "She tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won't happen, and I shouldn't be worried.\n",
    "\n",
    "That reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.\n",
    "\n",
    "I swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there's no way I have the energy to cook dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "I saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).\n",
    "\n",
    "I apologize again, she says it's fine, and I ask her if she's planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tell her that I'm getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it's only fair that I buy her dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "She agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it's not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men's bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn't walk into the ladies' room.\n",
    "\n",
    "She laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.\n",
    "\n",
    "I agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.\n",
    "\n",
