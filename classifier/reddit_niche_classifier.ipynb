She plays dumb and gives half assed apologies the next day but it’s been a reoccurring theme since we got together. I’m a musician and she insists on coming to all my shows but all she does is put me on edge, it’s gotten to the stage where I don’t like bringing her anywhere. It’s like she physically can’t keep it to herself if she finds someone else attractive and will flirt with them right in front of me. It’s frustrating as fuck because the last thing I want to be is a jealous boyfriend but it gets under my skin. I just want to feel like I’m enough and appreciated, which she does make me feel the majority of the time but this streak in her is really pushing me away and I don’t think she understands. I feel like a broken record and have told her many times how much it bothers and hurts me but it still persists. \n",

I have tunnel vision for her and she claims to have it for me but her actions when she’s drunk say otherwise. Can anyone give me advice as to what to do?

After talking to this woman (41) I met online for a couple weeks we decided to meet. The date was fun, lots of good communication and laughing but no real flirting. We discussed after the date and she wanted to just be friends as I “wasn’t her physical type”\n",

And I didn’t really care because I needed some friends in the area and we got along really well. We also then started flirting more as friends…she even sent me a handful of nudes throughout the next few weeks, one night we went to a strip club together and made out a bunch after.\n",

So we went on our first date as not friends. Again, there was no real flirting, no kissing, no sex, even tho se invited me to stay overnight. The next time we hung out was for Easter brunch and she brought her son, but he is currently under the impression we are @just friends”. She says she wants him to get to know me before she tells him. She has told her sister and mother about us. We have also fairly evenly split the bills on our dates.\n",

I work, and try to support us both but with the amount of money I make at my job (I'm currently looking for something better but I still do have a little 1200 a month coming in) I just straight up don't have enough to pay both of our bills and find myself being either close to broke or broke towards my next check hitting. She of course just sits in bed most of the day, watching YouTube, sleeping, or playing Minecraft, and not much else. When I told her I wanted to see where the possibility of the new girl went, she said she was going to write some notes and end her life.

      "Body text: Hello! I'm not good at choosing titles and the situation is a bit more complicated, but here goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been with my husband for around 7 years, married 2. Initially we were both working, and both HARD workers. I usually came back home late from doing three thousand things (I lived alone so I also managed the rest of the survival stuff, of course) and my husband (who lived with his parents) did regular overtime for no reason but that he liked his job so much.  We both specialize in language work (let me know if you need more details).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of our marriage, my husband lost his job. It came out of nowhere as he was performing well, and it took a toll on him emotionally, but I reassured him that everything would be fine since he's actually good at what he does. We came up with this agreement: he'd pick up the majority of the housework while looking for a new job and I'd focus on work, with the exception of things that I prefer to manage myself because I'm more organized and less forgetful, i.e. keeping track of the bills, scheduling appointments and doing the laundry since my clothes need an amount of care I don't want to dump on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This didn't work out well from the start. My husband cooks, which is great, but aside from that he does the bare minimum not to be outright unsanitary. He washes the dishes, tosses the trash, uses the robot to vacuum the floor and puts his dirty clothes in the dedicated laundry area. But... that's it. He cleans surfaces (like the sink or the furniture) whenever I beg him to do it, like after a month or two, and constantly leaves stuff on tables etc around the house without putting it away. This creates mess and dust. Initially I kept asking him to do things, but I stopped recently because I thought that maybe I was micro-managing....... and this is an example of what happened: he left a bag with a piece of clothing he needed to take to the mender (10 minutes away on foot) on a chair for two months, up to the point that when I asked him if I should take it instead, he didn't even remember where he had put it (though it's literally in plain view in the living room).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had conversations with him about this, and he insists that he can't focus on anything else while he's stressed out looking for a job. I understand his feelings, so I told him to let me know if he wants to change the division of labor, since I'd rather know upfront that I need to do something (so I can schedule it in my day directly) rather than having the false reassurance that it'll get done just to find out that it's still there weeks or months later. To this, he tells me not to worry and to leave it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has all come to a head recently because my job has suddenly become more demanding. I was usually able to do some more things around the house whether he asked me for help or not, but for the past few months I've barely had any time to exist outside of work. My company's most important client has started multiple lengthy, specialized projects at the same time, with barely meetable deadlines even with a full team. What's worse: we're two people short. My company doesn't want to say no to the client, and I don't want to say no to the company since my job is otherwise great (plus better paid than 90% of jobs in my industry) AND the only money that keeps me and my husband afloat, so I've been literally working for three people nonstop. I regularly go to sleep with a headache, wake up with a headache, and feel back pain. My fingers have started twitching like a pre-industrial revolution factory worker. I've still been managing admin tasks at home, but I honestly haven't had the physical or emotional strength to un-mess the tables and whatnot. I don't even have it in me to talk to friends most days anymore.\n",

So I get upset and I ask him why he can't fulfill his end of the bargain as I do. Yesterday he told me, in more or less these words: \"If I did what you do, I'd be able to do more and faster. You just have to sit and type. It's not the same.\"\n",

But as soon as I look around at our life, I feel like an ATM. This isn't the first time that he has implied that my job is easier, and I'm tired of hearing it when I KNOW that I'm breaking my back much harder than a dude dusting shelves for an hour every month. He claims that he didn't mean it as a comparison, that he just wanted to say that my job is easier in a vacuum, but even then...... What does it even mean?

      "I 19M am dating my gf18F for over a year now (known her for 2), and I feel like she doesn't appreciate me or respect me in a way? We are both each other's first serious relationship and shes just finishing her first year of college soon for some background info. It's nothing huge it's just tiny things that add up. For example I was at her family's recently for Easter dinner and while we were getting food she poured her drink and I held my cup up then asked for her to pour me some, she then put down the juice container and told me to pour it myself because I'm a man. Another time I was over at her house and she was making herself a sandwich so I asked if she could also make me one and got a similar response. Whenever I go to her house for the weekends (she lives an hour and 30 mins away) she won't let me eat her food or if I do she expects me to pay her (not joking), I got upset at this one morning so she gave me a muffin her mom made while she made herself breakfast. Other things like if I don't text goodnight she won't, she doesn't come to my city for any weekends even though her parents live here because \"gas is too expensive\", one thing that gets under my skin in that she has a guy friend that shes known for 3 years and he has admitted he liked her in the past. He even wrote her a letter saying how happy he is that they're friends when they first started being friends. I've let her know I don't like when she talks to him but I can't force anything, I feel silly writing this but she accepted a gift from him in a video game, it wouldn't bother me but it was a $40 item so to me its not so much that it's a video game but the message behind it? Whenever she is messaging anyone on her phone she also hides her screen from me... We do genuinely get along and for anniversaries or bdays she does spend a lot of time to make me handmade gifts, she doesn't expect me to pay for her when we go out to eat but I do anyways, she doesn't go out on the weekends and has only a couple friends, she pretty much just goes to school and the gym.  For our first date actually she wouldn't let me buy her stuff because I needed to save money for a vehicle, she always talks about our future together and wanting kids eventually. I do love her a ton but I really don't feel like she appreciates me. I'm thinking of having a serious talk with her, I'm not sure if she just has a different love language than me or she's just really frugal or what, but I don't feel like I'm appreciated or really respected , is there some way I could bring this up without being too confrontational about it? \n",

      "Title: Intimacy in marriage\n",
      "Body text: My wife (F37) and I (M38) have been together for a long time (11 years) and have been married for two years now. Our child will soon turn 2. Overall, we are happy and have a good connection in many ways, but not in others – which is essentially what this is about. Sex was already a somewhat strained topic before we became parents, partly due to how I handled it. My drive is higher, and I wanted more, so I pressured her to some extent and/or made more or less clumsy advances. We even went to therapy about this for a short time, and looking back, I'm not sure if it was the therapy or our own efforts that helped (the whole thing had become a VERY prominent topic, which is actually important, but it also took away the lightness) – maybe both – but afterward, we found a fairly fulfilling path of rather penetration-free, attentive, and reasonably regular sex for quite some time. Sex had become something rather positive in our relationship, and we had removed the burdensome weight from it. All in all, I would have wanted more and different kinds of sex, but I had come to terms with it because it only works when you meet each other halfway, and there was genuine closeness in it that was already fulfilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the last few years have been eventful in both positive and negative ways, leaving their mark and turning us into somewhat different people. I don't know if I had a major hormonal change because my desire has remained quite high (I’d always have the higher sex drive and initiate things), but becoming a father did do something to my libido. I found fulfillment in the role, and we naturally had completely different issues to focus our capacities on during this initial time with a child. The conception phase (which, honestly, I thought could go by quickly because I wanted to be a father and not have to worry, though a bit more sex wouldn't be bad either) was short, as my wife got pregnant immediately after one time. However, for a long time, I didn't miss anything, and I naturally took care of what I needed myself. Now, though, the desire is returning for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, relatively shortly after our child's birth, we very suddenly lost my wife's mother, which naturally tore a complete hole and changed everything. For my wife, it's a loss of her closest person and confidant that cannot be put into words. We are now quickly alarmed, certainly traumatized in some way, and we also worry about the other grandparents. So we went from the highest high to a deep low, and I can definitely sense the emotional chaos my wife is experiencing. There is still so much that needs to be or should be processed. Besides fatigue, feeling touched out (she is still breastfeeding, and at times quite a lot, especially at night), stress, almost no time for just the two of us, etc. – all of which is already more than enough to make intimacy of any kind difficult – we also have another level in this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet my desire is slowly returning. In theory – and also through the few words we've exchanged about it – I actually know what the situation is now and what an appropriate next step would be: she says we would first need a foundation of sex-free intimacy – talking, cuddling, communicating, listening, and understanding. I understand this quite well, and I want to work on it. As described in the previous section, we are probably at a point again where we need to relearn physical and mental intimacy together, only this time other emotions and issues are demanding our capacities as well. I also think it could provide relief and freedom for my wife if we change something in the care work – our child sometimes falls asleep with me, but my wife takes over the nights, which are often very draining for her. During the day, I'm out and about with the child a lot and gladly so, and she has time for herself or activities (fortunately, my job allows for this to some extent), but there's still room for improvement – mental load is also occasionally an issue. I'll end the text here; it's getting very long, and it's not easy to portray the constellation in all its facets. It already contained \"approaches to solutions\" that I see, but I simply feel it might help me to understand more deeply and practically, not just theoretically, through outside perspectives, what's going on and what could now be a harmonious path for both of us. I made a little to-do-list for myself that involves sharing the care work without being told but seeing things that need to be done myself, staying fit and active, being responsible for „projects“ (the garden is soooo important to her), listening/cuddling, „dating“ her whenever we can even if it’s just an hour…I sometimes hoped I could watch less porn but right now as it’s the only sexual thing I got I can’t really get rid of it (she understands). I wrote her a little text saying that I somehow also experienced that through cuddling and caring (we had holidays and a small vacation this last week) the connection (and desire) on my side increased - so kind of like she seems to feel. She said she didn’t really read it because actions speak louder than words, that we now have started a path and should not obstruct it with hollow words (I kind of get it because I also think you can kill sexual momentum with blabber but also communication is key…she said if there still will be a problem and I would like to criticise her I should say it to her face then). How can we work out intimacy in our marriage and work towards a healthy sex life?\n",

He's never cheated on me or been physically violent, but he's said many hurtful things to me in the past. Sometimes some of things he's said in the past keeps replaying in my head and it makes me sad. For example, he's told me that I'm young and dumb, immature, insecure, not beautiful, and don't look like a model. He's also a recovering porn addict, he used to follow so many adult content creators and Instagram models until he stopped one day. It genuinely seems like he's actively trying to better himself now and he's definitely a different person that he was when we first started dating. I just want to forgive and forget, but I find myself struggling to do so.

      "My gf has shut down on me and is creating more and more distance between us. Which makes me feel absolutely horrible because it feels as though she wants less and less to do with me and I’m unsure of how to navigate this. It feels like nothing I do is good enough so it’s very defeating. By shut down I mean, she has stopped calling me pet names like “baby/babe” and now rarely says I love you and often times only in response to me saying it first. Doesn’t enjoy cuddling anymore when physical touch has always been very prevalent in our relationship. She still texts me throughout the day and of course acknowledges me when we’re home and we get along. She continues to allow me to help take care of her son and asks about my day, but it all feels very platonic and not romantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit of background about us: we have known each other for 8+ yrs and were best friends prior to dating. They have a very young son (toddler), with a disability, from their previous marriage and she now shares custody of her child. As is the usual case, the beginning of our relationship was great but once I moved in, we began figuring out each other’s boundaries and trying to navigate through life with them, while also navigating how I fit into her son’s life and the extra support he needs. We would have arguments every few weeks…which is partially contributed to the fact that we have her child every other weekend. So on a “child free” weekend we’d have an argument but then have her child for the rest of the week so we can’t have these difficult discussions trying to resolve these arguments because we don’t want to do this in front of her child, which then leads to this problem never being addressed during a time of less heightened & more calm emotions. By the time the next weekend without her son rolls around, we’re upset again usually about the same issue(s) that we never had a chance to talk about and the process kind of rinses and repeats itself. I also work night shift and she works very early morning, so having discussions even when her son goes to bed is very difficult to do. Obviously this was a very unhealthy way to deal with any of the issue(s) we’ve had with each other because we never had the time of clear headed conflict resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last Sunday I was expressing how it hurts when she shuts me out. I know she needs time to herself and space, so I try to offer that space but how I never know when that “space” ends. I let her know that I make a big effort to not take it personally when she says no to cuddling, or wanting to spend time alone, but it’s very difficult to not feel rejected. I told her that I don’t want the ”needing space” to become “pushing me away”. She told me that she understands, that it’s very difficult for her because she has a lot of frustrations, anxiety, emotions that she doesn’t know how to express so she just wants to be left alone but she doesn’t want to hurt my feelings by saying no to me. She says she misses being on her own sometimes and being independent, but she also doesn’t want me to leave. She says that she doesn’t know if our problems are “fixable” and they’ve been going on for so long. She’s afraid that, if we’re fighting like this 1yr into our relationship (although we’ve known each other for almost a decade) what will it say 5yrs down the road. I acknowledged that I haven’t been great at conflict resolution and I’m trying to grow in that and would just love for her to do it with me. How I know we have a hard time finding time to resolve something but I want to make an effort to really do that. I said that I think we both struggled with me moving in because we’re now figuring out each other’s boundaries while also trying to protect our own self. I firmly believe we could get through these issues because, honestly, when I look at them for face value they’re very basic issues that came out of being misinterpreted or just a lack of clarification and now it’s essentially a mountain made out of a mole hill. She kind of ended the discussion by saying she still loves me, she just isn’t sure what to do from here and that she just has so much going on, she’d just like to stop feeling. She offered me a hug and kiss and made a remark of how I’m still her favorite kisser. We had a good rest of our weekend and it’s not like we’ve had an argument since then, but now when I text her I love her or call her “baby” I don’t get those same responses. It feels platonic instead of romantic. I don’t know what to do from this point on. I genuinely feel like she is the love of my life and we used to talk about wanting to get married, so I am not looking for “just break up” because I think we both do genuinely love each other, but we’re in a tough spot that we aren’t sure how to get out of. I am not asking if either of us is right or wrong in the situation, but just how we should get through this, regardless of who is right or wrong. Should I just stop trying “push” our relationship? Am I putting too much pressure on it now? Should I stay with a friend for a couple of days so she can have a home to herself to “reset”? I’m having a hard time coping, feeling like she’s pushing me away. I feel like if she wanted to break up with me then she would have, but I’m also afraid that if she keeps pushing me away, it’ll lead to that. I need helpful advice on how to cope with a partner who is overwhelmed with a lot of emotion and has shut down on me.\n",

My thought is that from that point on, I realized that he could potentially be my life partner. I quickly developed abandonment anxiety.\n",

      "I always knew that he was friends with a lot of women, but since I was self-confident in the beginning, it didn't bother me. I brought it up to him and didn't meet with acceptance, but rather with \"I shouldn't worry.\" At that point, however, I became more and more of an overthinker because I constantly saw posts from other women on his social media, and I had questions in my head like: Am I good enough? Does he find me attractive? Will he leave me for someone else? The fear grew and grew, and then, six months later, I found myself with 24/7 stress and negative thoughts in my head.\n",

When I noticed this and asked him about it, he said he didn't want to tell me about it because they didn't actually meet up, and he didn't want to stress me out or make me feel bad about it. Then I thought to myself, if you think I have a problem with it, why are you even trying, and why aren't you being honest?

As I said, I didn't want to forbid him from doing it, but it was very difficult to stay calm. Sleepless nights and panic attacks were part of the daily routine during those two weeks. In between, I spoke to his sister on the phone, and she said she didn't understand why he absolutely had to meet up with this girlfriend when he knew what it was doing to me...

He’s obviouslu against bikinis, and even some swimdresses if they show cleavage or are too short. According to him, it’s not safe for me to get too much male attention, especially if I’m out alone. That idea has only come up more recently,I was “allowed” to wear skirts for the first nine months of our relationship, but then he changed his mind after I broke his trust on multiple occasions, and if I hadn’t, then he wouldn’t have had to take that back or make such strict rules.\n",

I have trouble regulating them due to abuse and mental health struggles but communicating has always been very important to me. I am rather straight forward and he bottles emotions and isn't as good with communicating things.

      "I'm messy and unorganized on the best of days. I struggle a lot to work full time, raise my son with next to no support, deal with the unbelievable amount of chaos that's always coming up. Constantly run thin but always trying again. My house does not stay spotless and me and my son do have some messy habits. I didn't have structure growing up so I'm winging it trying to give him the most I can but it's hard. This will be relevant for later because me being messy has always been something my bf hones in on and always nit picks at. It's not like gross but I don't mind the dirty cloths on the bathroom floor till I get to them and I'm a bit of a gremlin when it comes to my room. My son leaves stuff around, which is also annoying to me and I'll have him clean up his mess. He(my son) does help me clean. My bf is the opposite and is very tidy. There's other things but that's the main one. The other main thing is is absolute lack of communication. He will not say shit till I am trying to express something and then he brings up things that aren't even related to what I'm trying to say. \n",

Like first of all, if you know I don't have time or energy to keep my house spotless and you don't want to make me feel bad about it why are you constantly nit picking it, habits can change and get better over time and my son can be taught to be better but I can only do so much with what I have right now and why the hell would me being messy be enough to send you over the edge and get so pissed?? I can keep up with the house better if I wasn't doing it all myself and had some support but I'm never gunna be as tidy as he is. Our nature is just different) \n",

What he brought up was how he didn't feel like a family when we eat together because me and my son are usually watching TV or something on my phone. Which hes never once said anything about. I didn't grow up eating as a family and it's been just me and my son for so long we always sat to eat together watching something. I was like you could have brought this up at any time, and he said he thought I would just figure it out because we are both adults. I was like I'm not a mind reader, and again hes bringing up things that aren't even related to what I was trying to talk about. I can't know something hes not verbally telling me. That's not how it works but he does that like I'm just supposed to know and change all my little habits he hates without actually telling me anything. It always feels so nit picky. Like just tell me you want to put screens away while we eat. That's fine with me but he doesn't and then hes pissed about it and doesn't say anything till I'm forcing communication.\n",

A while ago I sat him down and asked if despite fears and the rest if was willing to just work things out and do it together with me and just get some reassurance about what he wants. He basically told me he didn't know and hesitated. And my confidence has just been a bit crushed since then. So I ruminated on how I was feeling for a while because I didn't want to over react, I wanted to be sure about how I was feeling and do my best to tell him in a clear manner. We didn't really talk for a few weeks because I was defaulting to isolating with my feelings and he doesn't tend to reach out even if he needs me so we just weren't talking and I wasn't pretending like I was okay. \n",

Insecure, not emotionally secure, confused about what he really wants (because he talks about getting me pregnant, having a family, and getting married some day. Stuff like that but actually moving in together is too scary and me being messy is so bad to him that it's enough to possibly make him get pissed and lose his shit), that I'm not feeling good enough because hes always nit picking at flaws. Which maybe it's not nit picking, his preferences are valid but I'm just stuck like where do we compromise, or do I just need to be a different person to meet your standards? He offered no reassurance whatsoever. I felt completely ignored. Few days go by and I decide to go visit but I text him and tell like I'm still not feeling okay. But he doesn't respond to my text offering support and when I get there hes just acting like everything's all okay because hes not mad anymore and wanting to hug and kiss on me. Now I really don't like physical anything when I'm not emotionally OK because I don't wanna be affectionate that way because it doesn't feel genuine when I'm not okay and I just don't like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I go home trying to calm down and be like okay whatever don't over react. I texted him later like hey I'm really frustrated, I don't feel like you're emotionally supporting me. He replies, what do you want me to do? Brings up wanting me to change being messy and stuff, saying stuff about how I'm defensive about my son so he can't say anything (which he can but hes rude about it so I asked him to just think about how hes going to say it) and I'm like again this is what I mean. You don't listen and bring up stuff that isn't related to what I'm trying to say. Then he brings up the thing about eating as a family. When I said again he could have brought that up at any other moment. Like why do they always come up when I'm trying to communicate something to you. That he doesn't listen. Then he says something like, usually I can take care of your emotions but I'm going through a lot right now and you're not taking care of me and that I've been making everything about myself lately. Which just felt like such a blow. His brother died a few years around this time but my nephew just died February and my step dad died January. So yes we are both going though so much around this time but it's not just him struggling. And I feel like he always turns it back to him some how. Or isn't even addressing what I'm saying. I don't need him to be the keeper of my emotions and I told him that. I feel everything very intensely and sometimes I need extra time because my temper is shorter than a match stick but I'm the one dealing with them at the end of the day and controlling them so I'm not lashing out on the people around me unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of it I was just like I don't even care if you think I'm being selfish. Because all I needed from him was to reassure and to at least listen to how I was feeling. I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to be asking for. He wants this perfectly calm and peacful life and I told him when I first talked to him I don't know if I can offer him that because of my struggles and how there's alwsys something crazy popping up and kids definitely don't equal quiet and peace all the time. And I told him again last night it's fine if I'm not exactly what hes looking for in a partner if my flaws are too much, we dont have to force a relationship. But of course he didn't reply to that either time either. \n",
