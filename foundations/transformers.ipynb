    "# Transfomers\n",
    "- Transformers are perhaps one of the most special, impactful and important creations in AI/Computer Science of **all time**.\n",
    "- Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of tasks across different modalities, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio processing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hugging Face Transformers Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hugging Face Transformers** library is the most important and widely-used library for working with transformer models in the AI/ML ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is it?\n",
    "- A comprehensive Python library that provides easy access to thousands of pre-trained transformer models\n",
    "- Supports all major transformer architectures: BERT, GPT, T5, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and many more\n",
    "- Provides a unified, consistent API regardless of the underlying model architecture\n",
    "- Includes tools for fine-tuning, training from scratch, and deploying models to production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's significant\n",
    "The library democratized AI by making state-of-the-art transformer models accessible to developers, researchers, and companies worldwide. It created a standardized interface that works across different model families and tasks, building the largest model hub with 100,000+ pre-trained models shared by the community. This massive ecosystem is now used by thousands of companies in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pipeline Function - The Game Changer\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `pipeline()` function is the most simple object in the transformers library, yet perhaps the most revolutionary feature - it's like having a \"one-click\" solution for AI tasks. It handles tokenization, model loading, and post-processing automatically, supporting 20+ different tasks (classification, generation, translation, summarization, etc.) with zero configuration needed.\n",
    "- You can think of it as something that connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps. This lets us directly input any text and get an intelligible answer.\n",
    "- Below I will show you an example of sentiment analysis using the pipeline function, on our own inputs."

    "# Transformer Architecture\n",
    "- Transformer architecture is mainly composed of 2 blocks/layers/models:\n",
    "  - Encoder layer (left): The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
    "  - Decoder (right): The decoder uses the encoder’s representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs. \n",
    "- Here's an image for visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "![Transformer Architecture Visualisation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/transformers_blocks-dark.svg)\n",
    "- Each of these parts can be used independently too, depending on the task:\n",
    "  - Encoder-only models: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.\n",
    "  - Decoder-only models: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.\n",
    "  - Encoder-decoder models or sequence-to-sequence models: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization (what you see with pure ChatGPT).\n",
    "- Another key aspect of Transformer models are **Attention layers**.\n",
    "  - By the way, the transformer architecture was introduced in a Google paper titled \"Attention is All You Need\". Says a lot.\n",
    "-  This layer  will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain parts of the data (e.g. with LLMs, that would be words in the sentence) that you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each piece of data (word). \n",
    "  - Lets put this into context. Something that makes sense; imagine you have to translate text from English to French. The input is \"You like this house\", the translation model will need to look at \"you\" to get the proper translation for the word \"like\", because in French, the word \"like\" is written differently depending on the subject. But, the rest of the sentence is not useful for the translation of \"like\" in this case.\n",
    "  - In the same way, when translating “this” the model will also need to pay attention to the word \"house\", because “this” translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of “house”. \n",
    "  - With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
    "  - This same concept applies to ANY task at ANY scale associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",
    "  - Here's a code visualization and application of our example:"

    "- In the above image, we see a self-attention matrix from BERT (Layer 1, Head 1). Here’s how to read it:\n",

    "\t-\tX-axis (Key): The tokens that receive attention from the query.\n",

    "\n",
    "In short, a row shows which tokens a particular word is focusing on.\n",
    "- To further accelerate our understanding, we will briefly look at the original transformer architecture:\n",
    "  - Original transformer architecture was designed for translation.\n",
    "  - During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. \n",
    "  - In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). \n",
    "  - The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). \n",
    "    - For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    "  - To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!).\n",
    "  - For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
    "  - Here's a visualisation of the original Transformer architecture, with the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right:\n",
    "![Original Transformer Architecture Visualisation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/transformers-dark.svg)\n",
    "  - Note that the first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word.\n",
    "    - This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
    "  - The attention mask can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words — for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.\n",
    "  - Hopefully, this gave you a solid mental model of how the original Transformer architecture works — particularly the encoder-decoder setup and how attention mechanisms shape language understanding and generation. We covered this not just for historical context, but because these components (like self-attention, masking, and encoder-decoder flows) form the foundation of nearly all modern Transformer-based models. \n",
    "    - Understanding them now will make it much easier to grasp variants like GPT, BERT, or T5, and to debug, fine-tune, or even build your own architectures later on.\n",
    "  #### Architectures and checkpoints\n",
    "  - This is terminology that is important to know for now and later. You’ll see mentions of architectures and checkpoints as well as models. These terms all have slightly different meanings:\n",
    "    - **Architecture**: This is the skeleton of the model — the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "    - **Checkpoints**: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
    "    - **Model**: This is an umbrella term that isn’t as precise as “architecture” or “checkpoint\": it can mean both. This course will specify architecture or checkpoint when it matters to reduce ambiguity.\n",
    "    - Example: BERT is an architecture while bert-base-cased, a set of weights trained by the Google team for the first release of BERT, is a checkpoint. However, one can say “the BERT model” and “the bert-base-cased model.”\n"

    "## Language models and the most famous examples:\n",
    "- All the popular Transformer models (GPT, BERT, T5, etc.) have been trained as language models. \n",
    "- Language models are just models that have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion.\n",
    "- (Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!)\n",
    "- This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it’s less useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called transfer learning or fine-tuning. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a given task.\n",
    "- An example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the n previous words. This is called causal language modeling because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Additionally, the general strategy to achieve better performance is by increasing the models’ sizes as well as the amount of data they are pretrained on.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, training a model, especially a large one, requires a large amount of data. This becomes very costly in terms of time and compute resources.\n",

    "  - This pretraining is usually done on very large amounts of data. Therefore, it requires a very large corpus of data, and training can take up to several weeks.\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning**: training done AFTER a model has been pretrained. To perform fine-tuning, you first need a pretrained language model, then need to perform additional training with a dataset highly specific to your task.\n",
    "  - Now, this might seem confusing. Just train your model for your final use case from the start right? Here's some reasons why you do things this way:\n",
    "  - The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).\n",
    "  - Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning requires way less data to get decent results.\n",
    "  - For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
    "  - Fine-tuning example:\n",
    "    - You can take a pretrained model (that was thoroughly trained on the English language), and fine-tune it on the arXiv corpus, which then results in a science/research-based model.\n",
    "      - Corpus: a large and structured collection of text or speech data used for linguistic analysis and training ML models. In NLP/LLM context, it acts as the training data for our models that need to generate human language. \n",
    "      - arXiv corpus: arXiv is an archive of scholarly articles, primarily in scientific fields. So the arXiv corpus is a collection of scholarly articles available on the arXiv repository. \n",
    "    - The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data. The knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is “transferred,” (You’re transferring the capabilities of the pretrained model to a new domain/task using the arXiv data), hence the term transfer learning.\n",
    "- Important to note, that transfer learning **ENCOMPASSES** fine-tuning.\n",
    "- In most situations, fine-tuning revolves around retraining the last couple layers of a model, but can be applied to the whole model.  \n",
    "- Fine-tuning a model has lower time, data, financial, and environmental costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes (full fine-tuning, last-layer tuning, freezing first n-layers and training/readjusting the rest, peft, etc), as the training is less constraining (cheaper, faster, easier to experiment with) than a full pretraining.\n",
    "- This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model — one as close as possible to the task you have at hand — and fine-tune it."
